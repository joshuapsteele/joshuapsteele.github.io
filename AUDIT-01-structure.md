## File Naming Patterns

### Good Practices Observed ‚úÖ
- Consistent kebab-case naming
- No date prefixes (Hugo handles dates via front matter)
- Descriptive filenames
- No spaces or special characters

### Potential Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Some very long filenames (e.g., `the-guilt-of-karl-barth-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-barths-romerbrief-reading-of-romans-9301021.md`)
- No apparent naming convention for distinguishing content types

---

## URL Structure (from Hugo Config)

Based on front matter patterns:
- Blog posts: `https://joshuapsteele.com/[slug]/`
- Pages: `https://joshuapsteele.com/[page-slug]/`
- Aliases: Many posts have `/portfolio/` aliases

---

## Key Observations

### Strengths üí™
1. **Clean directory structure** - Simple two-folder organization
2. **Consistent naming** - All files follow kebab-case convention
3. **Separation of concerns** - Blog posts vs. pages clearly divided
4. **No legacy artifacts** - No obvious outdated file structures

### Areas for Improvement üìà
1. **No content subdirectories** - All 305 blog posts in single `/blog/` folder
2. **Missing taxonomy structure** - No year/month subdirectories (not required but sometimes helpful)
3. **No draft folder** - Drafts mixed with published content (handled via front matter)

### Red Flags üö©
1. **Unclear categorization** - 53.3% of traffic hits "Other" category content
2. **No series organization** - Multi-part posts not grouped
3. **Mixed content types** - Sermons, essays, blog posts all in same folder

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (No structural changes needed)
1. ‚úÖ **Keep current structure** - It's working well for Hugo
2. üîß **Focus on front matter** - Better categorization via metadata
3. üìù **Improve taxonomy** - Add/standardize categories and tags

### Future Considerations (Optional)
1. **Content subdirectories** - Consider organizing by year if site grows significantly
2. **Series organization** - Tag or category system for multi-part series
3. **Content type separation** - Potentially split sermons/essays if they grow

## Next Steps

1. **Proceed to Front Matter Analysis** - Audit metadata in all 348 files
2. **Cross-reference with analytics** - Prioritize high-traffic content
3. **Identify categorization gaps** - Focus on the 53.3% "Other" traffic
