# Theology Blog – Project Guide

## Purpose & Vision
The **Theology Blog** exists to help readers — especially those shaped by American fundamentalist and conservative evangelical traditions — broaden their theological horizons without abandoning a love for Jesus, Scripture, or the Church.

It’s also a place for “exvangelicals” like me to find thoughtful, biblically grounded resources they can share with their conservative friends and family to spark dialogue rather than shut it down.

This project draws on my theological training, ministry experience, and personal journey away from rigid fundamentalism toward a more generous, Christ-centered faith.

## Audience
- **Primary:** Thoughtful Christians in conservative evangelical contexts who are open (or could be persuaded) to rethinking certain theological positions.
- **Secondary:** Progressive/liberal Christians (“exvangelicals”) looking for biblically grounded posts to share with others.
- **Tonal Balance:** Gentle enough to avoid immediate dismissal, but prophetic enough to speak truth clearly.
- **Avoid:** Falling into stereotypes conservatives have about liberals (e.g., not caring about the Bible, sin, or Jesus).

---

## Tone & Style
- **Conversational**: Clear, accessible, and jargon-free unless a technical term is essential — and then explain it.
- **Biblically rooted**: Frequent Scripture quotations, careful exegesis, and theological reflection.
- **Engaged but gracious**: Assume the best of conversation partners while challenging harmful ideas.
- **Direct & concise**: Get to the point; avoid unnecessary filler.
- **Story-driven when appropriate**: Include personal anecdotes only when they enhance the argument.

## Theological Approach
- **Biblical authority**: Take the Bible seriously as God’s Word, without rigid inerrantist assumptions.
- **Hermeneutics**: Emphasize literary, historical, and theological readings over literalistic or proof-text approaches.
- **Scholarly influences**: Open to insights from scholars outside American evangelicalism (e.g., N.T. Wright, Fleming Rutledge, Richard Bauckham, David Bentley Hart, Pete Enns, Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer).
- **Key perspectives**:
  - No longer a young earth creationist.
  - Not dispensational; Revelation is not an end-times timeline.
  - Christian universalist (Hell as restorative, not eternal torment).
  - Open to LGBTQ affirmation, with a focus on faithful covenant love.
  - Willing to critique church abuse cover-ups and harmful denominational politics.

## Content Guidelines
1. **Structure**
   - Self-contained posts (no multi-part series).
   - Use clear H2 section headings; H3 as needed.
   - Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity.
   - Optional “TL;DR: Takeaways” section at the end.

2. **Format**
   - Markdown `.md` format for Hugo.
   - Include a front matter block for title, date, tags, categories, and other Hugo options.
   - Keep paragraphs short for readability.

3. **Topics**
   - Engage controversial theological issues with clarity and charity.
   - Show that one can deeply love Scripture and follow Jesus without adhering to rigid conservative interpretations.
   - Possible recurring themes:
     - How to disagree theologically without division.
     - Why I no longer hold X belief (creationism, dispensationalism, etc.).
     - The Bible’s teaching on justice, poverty, and wealth.
     - Rethinking gender and sexuality debates.
     - Reframing hell, salvation, and the end times.

4. **Voice**
   - Speak as a fellow Christian traveler, not a detached academic.
   - Combine personal conviction with pastoral sensitivity.
   - Anticipate objections from conservative readers and address them respectfully.
