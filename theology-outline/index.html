Yet this Son of God, confessed by Christians as “very God of very God” (Niceno-Constantinopolitan [Nicene] Creed), also cried out to the Father: “<strong>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</strong>” (Mark 15:34).</p><p>As Jenson rightly observes: “Therewith it becomes problematic that anything specified by listing ‘Father, Son, and Holy Spirit’ can be one God and not rather a mutually betraying pantheon.”<a href=#_ftn9>[9]</a></p><p>A simple solution to this problem of God’s unity would be to maintain that either <strong>just one</strong> (Subordinationism) or <strong>none</strong> (Modalism) of the three identities mentioned is <em>really</em> God. However, because the Church trusts Scripture as divine revelation, it believes that it knows the real God, whom it worships – delusion, according to Modalism. Furthermore, the Church worships all three divine Persons – idolatry, according to Subordinationism.</p><p><strong>We believe that we can truly know God in revelation, that God can give Godself to be known as an object, because God is first known by Godself – as Subject (Father), Object (Son), and Act of Revelation (Holy Spirit).<a href=#_ftn10>[10]</a></strong></p><p>In order to do justice to worship and the Word of God (or better, worship <em><u>of</u></em> the Word of God: Jesus), the Church confesses “that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit” (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed>Athanasian Creed</a>). One in three, three in one: Father, Son, and Spirit – each Person equally and essentially God, and yet each distinct from the other two.</p><p><strong>What about the “mutually betraying pantheon” revealed in Christ’s cry of dereliction?</strong></p><p>As it turns out, the Spirit preserves God’s unity at the most frayed moment – maintaining the bond of love between the forsak<em>ing</em> Father and the forsak<em>en</em> Son, a love so powerful it conquered death.<a href=#_ftn11>[11]</a> Through the power of the Holy Spirit, Christ is <em><strong>raised</strong></em> from the grave, <em><strong>revealed</strong></em> to be who he has always been: the Son of God (Rom. 1:4), and thereby <em><strong>restored</strong></em> to the Father.</p><p>The Trinity is one God, not three, because it is concerned with “a relationship between persons in which these persons constitute themselves in their relationship with each other.”<a href=#_ftn12>[12]</a> The doctrine of the Trinity holds together Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – as well as Crucifixion and Resurrection.</p><p>And yet, we are still faced with the difficulty of the Incarnation: <strong>how can the eternal God be so <span style=text-decoration:underline>temporal</span>, the transcendent One so <span style=text-decoration:underline>immanent</span>?</strong></p><p>(For more on the Trinity, see my essay: <a href=https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/>“The Holy Trinity: What Is It? (Why) Is It Important?”</a>)</p><h2 id=election-amp-creation>ELECTION & CREATION</h2><p>There is no escape from time, not even for God. The Trinity holds together not just Crucifixion and Resurrection, but time itself.<a href=#_ftn13>[13]</a></p><p>“<strong>Eternal</strong>” most properly means “without beginning, without end,” and not “<strong>timeless</strong>,” which means “without past, present, or future.”</p><p><strong>If we remove “timeless” from our definition of God’s eternality, the Trinity’s identification of itself with its temporal <em>opera ad extra</em> poses less of a theological threat (to divine transcendence), beginning with its first external work: <span style=text-decoration:underline>election</span>.</strong></p><p>Or is it <strong>creation</strong>?</p><p>Barth is right to expose the dialectical relationship between the two:</p><blockquote><p>“The creation of God, and therefore His positing of a reality distinct from Himself, is the external basis and possibility of the covenant. And the covenant itself is the internal basis and possibility of creation, and therefore of the existence of a reality distinct from God” (CD III/2, 204).</p></blockquote><p>The creaturely form and covenant content of the Triune God’s external works find their basis in the election of Jesus as the nexus of God and humanity – <strong>Christ is the electing God and the elected human, before the act of creation.</strong></p><p>That Jesus exists as the elect(ing) God-human before humanity itself exists – that <strong>he can precede himself, as it were</strong> – is but an illustration of <strong>the Triune God’s temporal transcendence, which is not threatened by (but rather displayed <span style=text-decoration:underline>through</span>) immanence.</strong></p><p>By, for, and to Jesus Christ “the universe is created as a theatre for God’s dealings with man and man’s dealings with God” (CD II/2, 94). Without a fully-orbed view of the Trinity, this extension outward from Godself to that which is not God, from Creator to creature, seems <strong>arbitrary</strong>. And yet, while God’s freedom can never be reduced to mere <span style=text-decoration:underline>necessity</span>, the eternal love which characterizes the life of the Trinity makes God’s free decision to elect and create most <span style=text-decoration:underline><em><strong>fitting</strong></em></span>.</p><p><strong>Through Christ, there is a correspondence between the existence and love of God <em>ad intra</em> – between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – and the existence and love of God <em>ad extra</em> to humanity.</strong></p><p>Humanity only exists within this Christological correspondence, on the basis of a shared sphere with Christ.<a href=#_ftn14>[14]</a> Therefore, “to be a man is to be with God,” for no matter what else each individual is, “he is on the basis of the fact that he is with Jesus and therefore with God” (CD III/2, 135). <strong>The Incarnation grounds anthropology in the Triune God’s address to humanity through Jesus Christ.</strong></p><h2 id=reconciliation>RECONCILIATION</h2><p>However, the Incarnation also yields the clearest view of sin’s absurdity.</p><p><strong>Although the distinction between Creator and creation entails the <em>possibility</em> of creaturely conflict with God, it does not necessitate <em>actual sin</em>.</strong></p><p>Given the Christological and theological basis of human existence, <strong>it makes no sense</strong> for a human to actualize this possibility, for “if he denies God, he denies himself” and “chooses his own impossibility” (CD III/2, 136).</p><p>Just as there is no God behind God, there is no humanity beyond the divine summons, beyond existence in the same sphere inhabited by Christ. It is therefore unthinkable that humanity should try to be the source of its own existence, and yet this is precisely that which occurs.</p><p><strong>Therefore, sin is not merely <span style=text-decoration:underline>moral</span> – it is both <span style=text-decoration:underline>ontological</span> and <span style=text-decoration:underline>incomprehensible</span></strong>: the inherent contradiction of a nothingness which opposes God as the very ground of all existence and reality.</p><h2 id=back-to-the-cross-and-the-empty-tomb>Back to the Cross and the Empty Tomb</h2><p>Pardon the cyclical nature of this discussion, but it is time to return to the Crucifixion and Resurrection.</p><p><strong>Why did God the Father forsake?</strong></p><p><strong>Why was God the Son forsaken?</strong></p><p><strong>Why did the Spirit need to overcome the divine distancing?</strong></p><p>The answer to these questions begins with the eternal (before creation, but not timeless) election of Jesus Christ – for <strong>he is not just the <span style=text-decoration:underline>electing</span> God and elected human, but also the <span style=text-decoration:underline>damned</span> human and the damned God.</strong></p><p>Election is therefore <span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>double</strong></span>, in that (1) God elects unto <em><strong>Godself</strong></em>, through Jesus Christ, the incomprehensible nothingness – the terrible “<span style=text-decoration:underline>No</span>” – that is the inevitable outworking of human sin. However, (2) God elects unto <em><strong>humanity</strong></em>, through Jesus Christ, the unmerited invitation – the wonderful “<span style=text-decoration:underline>Yes</span>” – into the love and life of the Triune God.</p><p><strong>An eternal exchange. A “Yes” and a “No.”</strong></p><p>This is all beginning to sound rather <em>timeless</em>.</p><p>And yet, a proper appreciation of the <em><strong>timeliness</strong></em> of the Trinity is necessary to make sense of the divine revelation we have actually received, <strong>for the Bible contains but an account of the Trinity’s external works in the midst of time – first through the story of Israel, and then through the story of the Church.</strong><a href=#_ftn15>[15]</a></p><h2 id=the-story-of-scripture>THE STORY OF SCRIPTURE:</h2><p>Between creation and the Incarnation lies the story of <strong>ISRAEL</strong>, lamentably overlooked in many formulations of the Christian faith.<a href=#_ftn16>[16]</a></p><p>Despite the invasion of <strong>SIN</strong> (Gen. 3) – which ruptured the perfect relationships between God and humanity, humanity and itself, and humanity and the rest of creation (with ontological implications, as mentioned above) – God does not abandon creation to its exile.

Usually, one should only dispense with Church traditions that appear directly to contradict God’s Word:</p><blockquote><p>“Whosoever, through his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church…” (Articles of Religion, 34).</p></blockquote><p>The history of the “one, holy, catholic, and apostolic” (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed>Nicene Creed</a>) Church, despite its frequent descent into divided, profane, sectarian innovation, has <strong>great value</strong>.</p><p>Because it is a part of the history of the temporally-eternal, transcendently-immanent, Triune God – because it matters to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – <strong>the life and history of the Church ought to matter to all who call themselves Christians, Anglicans or not.</strong></p><p>(<a href=https://www.academia.edu/17676169/A_Crucicentric_Credo>View PDF here</a>.)</p><hr><h1 id=notes>NOTES</h1><p><a href=#_ftnref1>[1]</a> Jürgen Moltmann, <em>The Way of Jesus Christ: Christology in Messianic Dimensions</em> (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 1990), 151.</p><p><a href=#_ftnref2>[2]</a> Regarding the precise date of the Crucifixion, scholars are divided between AD 30 and 33.</p><p><a href=#_ftnref3>[3]</a> On the Crucifixion as theophany, see Moltmann, <em>The Crucified God</em> (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 1993 [1973]).</p><p><a href=#_ftnref4>[4]</a> Robert W.
