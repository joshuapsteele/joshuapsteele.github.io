Today, I want to share my insights from various personality paradigms and how they shape my approach to work and life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cliftonstrengths-harnessing-core-talents">CliftonStrengths: Harnessing Core Talents&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The CliftonStrengths assessment has been instrumental in identifying my core talents. Here are my top five strengths:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Input&lt;/strong>: I have an insatiable curiosity and a constant desire to collect information. This strength fuels my drive to learn and gather knowledge from diverse sources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Intellection&lt;/strong>: My love for deep thinking and intellectual discussions is a hallmark of this strength. It allows me to explore complex ideas and engage in thoughtful analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Learner&lt;/strong>: The process of learning excites me. Whether it’s acquiring new skills or understanding new concepts, I thrive in environments that offer continuous growth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ideation&lt;/strong>: Creativity and innovation are my playgrounds. I enjoy brainstorming and generating new ideas, which often leads to novel solutions and approaches.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Analytical&lt;/strong>: I have a keen ability to dissect problems and examine them from different angles. This strength helps me make informed decisions based on solid data and evidence.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You are not your thoughts. There is a “you” behind and above your inner voice/monologue/dialogue. Pay attention to what you pay attention to. Think about what you think about.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We always only have the present moment. Focusing too much on the future leads to anxiety. Focusing too much on the past leads to depression. Wherever you are, be fully there, now! (Read &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/400hFeH">&lt;em>The Power of Now&lt;/em> by Eckhart Tolle&lt;/a> [affiliate link here and throughout] for more on this.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s OK not to be OK. Feeling anxious, depressed, angry, etc. is fine. However, avoid the trap of feeling anxious about how anxious you feel, feeling depressed about how depressed you feel, etc. (Learned this from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/404talb">&lt;em>The Happiness Trap&lt;/em> by Russ Harris&lt;/a>.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you never make mistakes, you’re not learning/growing as well as you could be. Perfectionism is a deadly prison. Break free with “good enough” and “always learning.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are stronger than you think you are. You are weaker than you think you are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask more questions. Ask better questions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God is not a thing among things. There is an “infinite qualitative difference” between God and everything that is not God, everything that exists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jesus of Nazareth is the living Lord of all. ___ is not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beware of overconfidence in what the Bible (or any other sacred text, for that matter) “clearly”does or does not say.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God is devoted to the poor and powerless. Those who speak and act on God’s behalf should speak and act &lt;em>for&lt;/em> the poor and powerless.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To do better with people, ask them questions about themselves. (Read the classic &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3QlSsrR">&lt;em>How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/em> by Dale Carnegie&lt;/a>.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can’t out-exercise your appetite forever. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4018XfY">Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get enough sleep. You probably don’t get enough sleep.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lift heavy things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go outside. Take a walk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open a Roth IRA. Invest consistently in low-cost mutual funds or lifecycle funds as soon as you can. (Learned this from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/48Uc65D">&lt;em>I Will Teach You to Be Rich&lt;/em> by Ramit Sethi&lt;/a>.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reading is a superpower. You can learn from as many other lives and lifetimes as you want. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/46YrOdW">Learn how to read&lt;/a>. Then &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/46Dgm7J">learn how to learn.&lt;/a> Then, learn whatever you want!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always read with a pen or pencil in your hand. If you really want to learn from a book, buy a physical copy and annotate the heck out of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You always have to earn and keep your audience’s attention. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “Why should they care? What’s in it for them?”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Humans are incredibly good at misunderstanding each other. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “How might I be misunderstood? How might I be misunderstanding others?”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember that you and your loved ones are all going to die. What do you want to be known for?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eulogize people BEFORE they die.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone should go to therapy for at least a few months.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.” Feeling nervous/stressed/angry/etc.? SLOW DOWN, especially if you’re in front of other people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Courage is a choice, not a feeling. No matter how nervous you are, you can always ACT courageously.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone is trying to figure it out as they go along. Do you often feel like an imposter? Join the club!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Act like you’ve been here before. Act like you’ve done this before. Act calm, comfortable, and confident, if for no other reason than to help the people around you feel calm, comfortable, and confident.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leadership is service. Leadership is the willingness to make a decision for the good of the group even when it’s awkward or uncomfortable to do so.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focus on what you can control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Journal. What do you really want? What are you afraid of? What’s the most important thing you need to get done today? Get a notebook and write it down!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In many domains, 80% of the outcomes/effects come from 20% of the inputs/causes. Find the “vital few” things that have outsized impacts, both positive and negative, on your life. Double-down on what’s helping you. Get rid of what’s hurting you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use smoked paprika. You’re welcome.&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Four Tendencies: 4 Ways You Can Play to Your Personality Strengths</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-four-tendencies-4-ways-you-can-play-to-your-personality-strengths/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 18:39:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-four-tendencies-4-ways-you-can-play-to-your-personality-strengths/</guid><description>&lt;p>In both my personal and coaching conversations recently, Gretchen Rubin’s personality framework called “The Four Tendencies” has really seemed to resonate with people.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If I remember correctly, I first heard of and listened to Jordan Peterson on &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/08/31/podcast-335-using-power-myths-live-flourishing-life/">an episode of The Art of Manliness podcast&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>However, after reading the book, which is just 120 pages long including endnotes!, I believe that Challies makes good on his claim.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ss&amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=joshuapsteele-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=1941114172&amp;asins=1941114172&amp;linkId=61476ee8a72a820b76e43d746b704020&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true" style="width:120px;height:240px;">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;p>As far as explicitly Christian approaches to personal productivity go, Challies’ &lt;em>Do More Better&lt;/em> stands alongside &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2uf5r6A">Matt Perman’s &lt;em>What’s Best Next: How the Gospel Transforms the Way You Get Things Done&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. While Perman’s book is fantastic and thorough, Challies’ book has the advantage of being MUCH shorter (120 pages vs. 383 pages).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Need to Develop a Writing Habit.

However, as &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/getting-things-done-ten-years-in-1795707084">Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017&lt;/a>, “You don’t hear a lot of people talk about the &lt;a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">&lt;em>Getting Things Done&lt;/em>&lt;/a> productivity system anymore.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that’s a shame, because it’s a very effective system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I first tried Getting Things Done after reading “&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2tMiX1w">What’s Best Nex&lt;/a>t” by Matt Perman, and then reading “&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2HvNJxv">Getting Things Done&lt;/a>” by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This One Simple Trick Helps Me Read Faster as a Ph.D. Student</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/one-simple-trick-helps-read-faster-ph-d-student/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 06:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/one-simple-trick-helps-read-faster-ph-d-student/</guid><description>&lt;p>Reading is the closest thing that human beings have to a superpower. We can learn, from other minds, from other times, just by looking at symbols on a screen or a page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, I mean, come on. Who has enough time to read? I don’t know about you, but I’ve got a stack of books a mile high that I’d like to work my way through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, there’s a bunch of good advice out there about &lt;strong>finding more time to read&lt;/strong> (see &lt;a href="https://www.fs.blog/2013/09/finding-time-to-read/">this post from Farnam Street&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2018/02/26/how-to-read-more-books/">this post from The Art of Manliness&lt;/a>). In fact, finding more time to read is one of the main reasons why you should learn the basics of personal productivity and time management (see &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/category/productivity-and-time-management/">my posts about productivity and time management&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Go to Sleep and Have Some Kids: What the Bible (Psalm 127) Says about Productivity</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/go-sleep-kids-bible-psalm-127-says-productivity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 12:51:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/go-sleep-kids-bible-psalm-127-says-productivity/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="personal-productivity-in-psalm-127">Personal Productivity in Psalm 127&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s how the Psalm opens:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;span class="text Ps-127-1">Unless the &lt;span class="small-caps">Lord&lt;/span> builds the house,&lt;/span>&lt;br>
&lt;span class="indent-1">&lt;span class="indent-1-breaks"> &lt;/span>&lt;span class="text Ps-127-1">the builders labor in vain.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br>
&lt;span class="text Ps-127-1">Unless the &lt;span class="small-caps">Lord&lt;/span> watches over the city,&lt;/span>&lt;br>
&lt;span class="indent-1">&lt;span class="indent-1-breaks"> &lt;/span>&lt;span class="text Ps-127-1">the guards stand watch in vain.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

Thomae Aquinatis ante studium&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/u>, which Thomas Aquinas would pray before studying, writing, or preaching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We prayed it responsively before class (Patristic and Medieval History and Doctrine) with Dr. Piotr Malysz at Beeson Divinity School, and I’ve since turned back to this prayer often!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But, honestly, I think that these reading recommendations stand up to the scrutiny.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been wracking my brain trying to come up with just the top 5 books that a busy Christian should read if she wants to learn the essentials about:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Productivity and Time Management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bible Study&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Theology&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And, I think I’ve arrived at a pretty good shortlist if I do say so myself. If you &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/understand-remember-read-4-questions-ask-reading-book/">read and understand&lt;/a> these 5 books, you’ll be well on your way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An 80/20 Approach to the Christian Life: 2 Reasons Why Christians Should Care About the Pareto Principle</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/80-20-approach-christian-life-2-reasons-christians-care-pareto-principle/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:48:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/80-20-approach-christian-life-2-reasons-christians-care-pareto-principle/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you want to live a more meaningful and purposeful Christian life, but you feel like it’s hard enough just to get everything done on your to-do list each day?&lt;/p>
