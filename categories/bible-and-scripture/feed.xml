&lt;p>Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scriptures to Read on Days of Prayer and Fasting for the Church</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/scriptures-to-read-on-days-of-prayer-and-fasting-for-the-church/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 12:17:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/scriptures-to-read-on-days-of-prayer-and-fasting-for-the-church/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="1-peter-417">1 Peter 4:17&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp;amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Quit laughing at &lt;em>How to Read a Book&lt;/em> by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Interestingly, for Bonhoeffer, Jesus is only speaking to his disciples in the Beatitudes (he makes this argument on the basis of Luke 6:20ff.). And the disciples’ renunciation and want are &lt;em>caused&lt;/em> by Jesus’s call to discipleship.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Jesus sees&lt;/em>: his disciples are over there. They have visibly left the people to join him. He has called each individual one. They have given up everything in response to his call. Now they are living in renunciation and want; they are the poorest of the poor, the most tempted of the tempted, the hungriest of the hungry. They have only him. Yes, and with him they have nothing in the world, nothing at all, but everything, everything with God. (DBWE 4:101).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Are the Beatitudes “Good Works”?

&lt;p>However, it’s pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the “standard” approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount.

&lt;h2 id="introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church">INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”&lt;sup>&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#post-41871-footnote-1">[1]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup> He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.&lt;sup>&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#post-41871-footnote-2">[2]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup> By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I think Karl Barth missed the (pastoral) point of Romans</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/i-think-karl-barth-missed-the-pastoral-point-of-romans/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 15:44:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/i-think-karl-barth-missed-the-pastoral-point-of-romans/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m scheduled to give a paper on Karl Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 in &lt;em>Der Römerbrief&lt;/em> at the &lt;a href="#">2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium&lt;/a> at Princeton in August.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, of course, it’s a pleasure and a privilege to give a paper at the colloquium. However, in hindsight, I don’t know why I thought giving a paper on chapter 10 of Barth’s Römerbrief was a good idea!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Granted, I don’t have to solve all of the exegetical issues (of which there are many) in Romans 9:30–10:21.

&lt;p>Just how &lt;em>eschatological&lt;/em> is the Lord’s Prayer (=LP; Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4), particularly in light of its second petition, “Your kingdom come” (ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου, Matt. 6:10a; Luke 11:2d)? In other words, when will God’s kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)? Furthermore, who brings the kingdom about? Humans? God? Or some combination of the two? Settling the question of eschatology involves both the timing and the agency, the &lt;em>when&lt;/em> and the &lt;em>who&lt;/em>, of the kingdom.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Into the Far Country</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/into-the-far-country/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 12:55:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/into-the-far-country/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Karl-Barth-Quote-Blue.png" alt="Karl Barth Quote Blue" title="Karl Barth Quote Blue.png" />

&lt;p>I don’t own a copy, so every time I have to consult BDAG I think “I really should buy this.” But for the past decade or so, primarily because of BDAG’s cost ($150 on Logos, $130 used on Amazon, $165 new on Amazon) I’ve held off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, I’m seeking to build my “must-have” personal reference library to sustain a ministry as a pastor theologian. So, I think I need to buy BDAG sometime soon.

&lt;p>Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Author: Geoffrey Turner&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What's the relationship between biblical and systematic/dogmatic theology?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/whats-the-relationship-between-biblical-and-systematic-dogmatic-theology/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:18:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/whats-the-relationship-between-biblical-and-systematic-dogmatic-theology/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the question we’re considering this week in our doctoral seminar on biblical and theological integration.

&lt;p>I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s how the Psalm opens:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is something special about last meals, isn’t there?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d like to show you a series of photographs. These photographs, except for the last one – which I added, are from &lt;a href="http://henryhargreaves.com/no-seconds">a piece called “No Seconds,” and they were put together by Henry Hargreaves&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t want to belabor the artwork with my commentary, so I’ll give you a few seconds to take each slide in.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food.

&lt;p>There are a few things you should know about me:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I am a student at a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> seminary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before that, I went to a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> college.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before that, I went to a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> high school, and a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> middle school.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> home.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Oh, also: I’m &lt;strong>the world’s worst sports fan&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/12-28-14JoshSteeleHolyInnocents.mp3">Today is December 28&lt;/a> (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents">The Slaughter of the Innocents&lt;/a>,” the killing of the baby boys of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem">Bethlehem&lt;/a> by King &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great">Herod&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back &lt;a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07419a.htm">to at least the fifth century&lt;/a>. In the fourth century, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatius">Chromatius&lt;/a> described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf. Around the same time, St. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine&lt;/a> claimed that these nameless victims, “&lt;em>&lt;strong>whom Herod’s cruelty tore as sucklings from their mothers’ bosom are justly hailed as the infant martyr flowers, the first buds of the church killed by the frost of persecution. They died not only for Christ but in his stead&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Brokenhearted God</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-brokenhearted-god/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 09:15:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-brokenhearted-god/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not to take away from the undeniably biblical teaching that God is almighty, but sometimes I think &lt;strong>we lose sight of God&amp;rsquo;s love for his image-bearers when we emphasize certain &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; portraits of God at the expense of (instead of alongside of) other &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; portraits found in Scripture&lt;/strong>. (I put &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; in quotes because perhaps our definitions of strength and weakness therefore need to change!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might make some of us uncomfortable to read about God portrayed as a jilted lover or a frustrated mother, but those portraits just might be desperately needed in a time when so many people turn away from God because they can&amp;rsquo;t understand how he can possibly be the good Lord of a world so broken and dying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Karl Barth on the Wilderness Temptations: #1, Stones into Bread</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 09:13:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth">Karl Barth&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> exegesis of &lt;a href="http://postbarthian.com/2013/07/17/karl-barth-on-the-temptation-of-jesus-in-the-wilderness/">Christ&amp;rsquo;s wilderness temptations&lt;/a> isperenniallyinspiring, but particularly poignant during this season of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent">Lent&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus&amp;rsquo; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Christ&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">first temptation was to turn stones into bread&lt;/a>, thereby using divine power as a &amp;ldquo;technical instrument&amp;rdquo; to save and maintain his own life.

&lt;p>It is a particularly appropriate discussion for this season of&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent">Lent&lt;/a>, for Jesus was not tempted to break the Law or commit a moral infraction. Instead, he was tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For Barth, if Christ had capitulated to any of the temptations, he would have abandoned God&amp;rsquo;s redemptive mission. Jesus Christ had to persist in penitence in order to be &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BAzwi9GQHtoC&amp;amp;pg=PA211&amp;amp;lpg=PA211&amp;amp;dq=judge+judged+in+our+place&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=6QQm6gLbOc&amp;amp;sig=T82UORb7xuRT8l8I__5370Dilk0&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=SRrtVOTuJK3ksATGrIDoDw&amp;amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=judge%20judged%20in%20our%20place&amp;amp;f=false">the Judge Judged in Our Place&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (Barth&amp;rsquo;s most concise description of the atonement proper).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Sermon: Our Help</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-sermon-our-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 14:06:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-sermon-our-help/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey internet: I was recently given the chance to preach at my church, &lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/">St. Peter’s Anglican&lt;/a>, on the &lt;a href="http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25">Second Sunday of Lent&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3">sermon audio is now online&lt;/a>. If you’ve got 23 minutes to spare, &lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3">give it a listen&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, &lt;a href="http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25">here are the passages&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Psalm 121&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Genesis 12:1-4&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Romans 4:1-5, 13-17&lt;/li>
&lt;li>John 3:1-17&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Then, make sure to &lt;strong>ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37&lt;/strong>&lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3"> in the audio&lt;/a>, I departed from my notes — which ended at “Nicodemus then fades from the narrative,” (which he does in the passage at hand) — and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again. As I was quickly reminded after the service, &lt;strong>he does appear twice more in John’s Gospel&lt;/strong>. Oops! Next time I’ll stick to my notes and not make any extemporaneous comments about minor characters without thinking through the context first.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Concerning Romans</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/concerning-romans/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 11:29:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/concerning-romans/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img loading="lazy" src="http://www.treybailey.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/romans_title.jpg" alt="" />

&lt;p>Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inductive Bible Study in 7 Steps: "Scripture, Handle With Care," by Amy Chase Ashley</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/inductive-bible-study-7-steps-amy-chase-ashley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2013 00:34:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/inductive-bible-study-7-steps-amy-chase-ashley/</guid><description>&lt;address>Update (April 2017): I’ve gone back to update/clean-up the formatting in this wonderful June 2013 guest post on the basics of inductive Bible study from my friend **Amy Elizabeth Chase Ashley,** one of the most gifted students of Scripture with whom I’ve been privileged to study.

I decided to give a message on something that is very important to me after my four years at &lt;a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/">Cedarville&lt;/a> and something I am very passionate about. I hope it will be &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">engaging&lt;/span>; I hope it will &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">make you think&lt;/span>; and I hope it will &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">bring glory to God&lt;/span>.

&lt;p>A great green theologian of old claimed that anger is based on fear, that it leads to hatred, and results in suffering. And while I do not wish to disregard the wisdom of a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I would like to take a closer look at anger as discussed in Scripture, and to consider what makes certain instances of anger righteous or unrighteous, legitimate or illegitimate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reading and Interpreting the Bible: Deuteronomy 6:1-15</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/deuteronomy-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2013 20:44:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/deuteronomy-6/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="deuteronomy-61-15-nrsv">Deuteronomy 6:1-15 (NRSV)&lt;/h1>

It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sacrificing Scripture on the Altars of Our Own Agendas</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/sacrificing-scripture-on-the-altars-of-our-own-agendas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2012 16:21:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/sacrificing-scripture-on-the-altars-of-our-own-agendas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions.

&lt;h1 id="creation-and-redemption-christ-and-new-creation">CREATION AND REDEMPTION: CHRIST AND NEW CREATION&lt;/h1>
&lt;div>Throughout the New Testament, the main use of creation theology is to link creation with redemption, resulting in the praise of the Creator through the Creator-Redeemer, Jesus the Messiah. However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions.[\[1\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1) The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple.[\[2\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2) Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.
&lt;p>The New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17).&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]&lt;/a> In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation.&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]&lt;/a> Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20).&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]&lt;/a> Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both &lt;em>made&lt;/em> (poievw).&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creation and Doxology: A Portrait of Biblical Creation Theology (pt. 2)</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 20:19:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/17/creation-and-doxology-pt-1/" title="Creation and Doxology (pt. 1)">(Read Pt. 1 First!)&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="creation-complexity-and-chaos">CREATION, COMPLEXITY, AND CHAOS&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Much of the chaos in the universe can be ascribed to the infiltration of Sin and Death as described in Genesis 3. However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God’s creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creation and Doxology: A Portrait of Biblical Creation Theology (pt. 1)</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 17:07:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In many conservative evangelical circles, biblical creation theology has been hijacked and eclipsed by the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism.&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1">[1]&lt;/a> It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology. Waltke summarizes the problem well: “Instead of metaphysical questions that shape culture, questions about dinosaurs, a young earth theory, and such dominate the evangelical landscape. This is unfortunate.”&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2">[2]&lt;/a> Nevertheless, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Scripture’s use of creation themes, whether the evangelical community gives them appropriate attention or not. Unfortunately, a comprehensive analysis of biblical creation theology, a field fertile enough to provide lifetimes of work and study, far exceeds the purview of this essay.&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]&lt;/a> However, a brief analysis of the motifs of creation as temple, chaos, and redemption will show that the overarching use of creation theology in Scripture is to bring about the praise of the Creator. Biblical creation theology, properly understood, leads to doxology.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Book of Romans, Distilled and Paraphrased</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/romans-distilled-paraphrased/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2012 14:02:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/romans-distilled-paraphrased/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
