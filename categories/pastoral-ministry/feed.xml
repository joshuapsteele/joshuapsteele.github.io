&lt;p>This also coincides with plans to move closer to family in NW Ohio (where there is not much of an ACNA presence to speak of) and to then pursue church involvement outside of the ACNA.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Logos 10 Bible Software: The Ultimate Theological Learning Tool</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/logos-10-bible-software-the-ultimate-theological-learning-tool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/logos-10-bible-software-the-ultimate-theological-learning-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR: If you’re serious about biblical and theological studies, you should invest in Logos 10 Bible Software. &lt;a href="https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;amp;AFID=529204">Do so via my exclusive partner offer for Logos 10 here!&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp;amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Quit laughing at &lt;em>How to Read a Book&lt;/em> by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Study computer science sooner rather than later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Want to Learn More about Women’s Ordination Debates within Anglicanism? Start With These Resources</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/want-to-learn-more-about-womens-ordination-debates-within-anglicanism-start-with-these-resources/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 14:31:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/want-to-learn-more-about-womens-ordination-debates-within-anglicanism-start-with-these-resources/</guid><description>&lt;p>Maybe you, like me, are coming to Anglicanism from a different tradition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If that’s the case, then one thing you should know is that Anglican debates about women’s ordination can often be quite different from debates about the same topic in other church contexts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is due to Anglicans having different views on, among other things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church),&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the sacraments, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ordination.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For example, in my broadly evangelical/non-denominational/Baptist upbringing, debates about women in ministry centered on whether or not women were allowed to preach and teach.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
