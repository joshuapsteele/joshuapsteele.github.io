Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prayers for the Sick</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/prayers-for-the-sick/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 23:15:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/prayers-for-the-sick/</guid><description>&lt;p>(The following prayers come from &lt;a href="https://www.bcponline.org/PastoralOffices/ministration_to_the_sick.html">the 1979 Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a>.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O Father of mercies and God of all comfort, our only help in time of need: We humbly beseech thee to behold, visit, and relieve thy sick servant &lt;em>N.&lt;/em> for whom our prayers are desired. Look upon &lt;em>him&lt;/em> with the eyes of thy mercy; comfort &lt;em>him&lt;/em> with a sense of thy goodness; preserve &lt;em>him&lt;/em> from the temptations of the enemy; and give &lt;em>him&lt;/em> patience under &lt;em>his&lt;/em> affliction. In thy good time, restore &lt;em>him&lt;/em> to health, and enable &lt;em>him&lt;/em> to lead the residue of &lt;em>his&lt;/em> life in thy fear, and to thy glory; and grant that finally he may dwell with thee in life everlasting; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;em>Amen.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Logos 10 Bible Software: The Ultimate Theological Learning Tool</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/logos-10-bible-software-the-ultimate-theological-learning-tool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/logos-10-bible-software-the-ultimate-theological-learning-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR: If you’re serious about biblical and theological studies, you should invest in Logos 10 Bible Software. &lt;a href="https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;amp;AFID=529204">Do so via my exclusive partner offer for Logos 10 here!&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp;amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Quit laughing at &lt;em>How to Read a Book&lt;/em> by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Study computer science sooner rather than later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Help!

I’m looking for the best, clearest, and most charitable explanations of the following three things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the biblical and theological reasons for caring about social justice and systemic racism,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the unfair ways in which some have used accusations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Cultural Marxism to sideline legitimate Christian concerns about social justice and systemic racism, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the legitimate Christian critiques of CRT and Marxism.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now, I &lt;em>know&lt;/em> that there are plenty of resources out there that address each of the three items above!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Collect for Juneteenth</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/a-collect-for-juneteenth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 03:06:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/a-collect-for-juneteenth/</guid><description>&lt;p>The following is a “collect” prayer that I composed for Juneteenth in 2020. What’s a “collect” prayer?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The short form of prayer, constructed (with many varieties of detail) from (1) an invocation, (2) a petition, and (3) a pleading of Christ’s name or an ascription of glory to God; and one of the most characteristic items in the W[estern] liturgy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, I’m worried that, especially for people who are not used to working their way through lengthy reading lists, getting so many recommendations at once will lead to nothing due to the paradox of choice. I’d much rather recommend a single book that someone will actually read than 100 books they won’t!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“But, What About the Riots and Lawlessness?”</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/but-what-about-the-riots-and-lawlessness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 21:47:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/but-what-about-the-riots-and-lawlessness/</guid><description>&lt;p>I commend &lt;a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/race-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-one.html">the entire interview series that Ed Stetzer recently did with Esau McCaulley&lt;/a>. Among many highlights, I appreciate McCaulley’s following answer to the question of negotiating the differences between protests and riots. Again, &lt;a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/racism-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-four.html">read the whole interview&lt;/a> and series, but here’s a key section related to concern about rioting and lawlessness:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Ed Stetzer] We both agree: Protests are good. Riots are not. Unpack that for us from your context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Esau: There is a cycle of what happens. There’s a racial incident. African Americans protest. Some of those protests from people inside and outside the community turn violent. People say, “Hey, look at this. Why aren’t the Christians who are speaking out against the racial injustice equally strong speaking about the riots?”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why is the word “systemic” a flashpoint for certain Christians?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/why-is-the-word-systemic-a-flashpoint-for-certain-christians/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 20:13:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/why-is-the-word-systemic-a-flashpoint-for-certain-christians/</guid><description>&lt;p>Certainly, the Bible has much to say about &lt;em>individual&lt;/em> sin and redemption. But (1) focusing on “systemic” issues doesn’t need to negate a focus on “individual” issues. In fact, a focus on “systemic racism” actually exerts a lot of pressure to evaluate people individually, and not on the basis of their race—as long as we keep in mind how those supposedly individual evaluations are often subtly (and nefariously) shaped by systemic issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>12 Prayers for Tough Days</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/12-prayers-for-tough-days/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 21:35:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/12-prayers-for-tough-days/</guid><description>&lt;p>The “Occasional Prayers” section of the Book of Common Prayer is a goldmine, particularly when the going gets tough.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>When faced with provocation to respond to what someone has said, give it five minutes&lt;/strong>. Take a walk, or weed the garden, or chop some vegetables. Get your body involved: your body knows the rhythms to live by, and if your mind falls into your body’s rhythm, you’ll have a better chance of thinking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Value learning over debating&lt;/strong>. Don’t “talk for victory.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As best you can, online and off, &lt;strong>avoid the people who fan flames&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember that &lt;strong>you don’t have to respond to what everyone else is responding to in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>If you &lt;em>do&lt;/em> have to respond to what everyone else is responding to&lt;/strong> in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness, or else lose your status in your community, then you should realize that &lt;strong>it’s not a community but rather an &lt;a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">Inner Ring&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Gravitate&lt;/strong> as best you can, in every way you can, &lt;strong>toward people who seem to value genuine community and can handle disagreement with equanimity&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Seek out the best and fairest-minded of people whose views you disagree with.&lt;/strong> Listen to them for a time without responding. Whatever they say, &lt;em>think it over&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Patiently, and as honestly as you can, &lt;strong>assess your &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repugnance">repugnances&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sometimes &lt;strong>the “ick factor”&lt;/strong> is telling; sometimes it’s a distraction from what matters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Beware of &lt;strong>metaphors&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>myths&lt;/strong> that do too much heavy cognitive lifting; notice what your &lt;strong>“&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terministic_screen">terministic screens&lt;/a>“&lt;/strong> [See pages 90–91] are directing your attention to-and what they’re directing your attention &lt;em>away from&lt;/em>; look closely for hidden metaphors and beware the power of myth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try to &lt;strong>describe others’ positions in the language that &lt;em>they&lt;/em> use, without indulging in in-other-wordsing.&lt;/strong> [See pg. 106: “We see it every day. Someone points at an argument—a blog post, say, or an op-ed column—and someone else replies, ‘In other words, you’re saying … ‘ And inevitably the argument, when put &lt;em>in other words&lt;/em>, is revealed to be vacuous or wicked.]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be &lt;strong>brave&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>But I know at least this: Instagram won’t save us, and tweeted verse will not undo what we’ve done to ourselves. But neither is there any special enchantment to reading in print. So this is not the Luddite’s redoubt, nostalgically canonizing codex or canvas as if history had come to an end in some glorious past. Every medium now reaches us inside the ecology of attention masterminded by Silicon Valley. We take pictures of our books and coffee, for heaven’s sake. The point isn’t platform but desire: what do we want when we pick up our phones? We don’t need better media, or to romanticize old media. We need to change what we want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use Rapoport's Rules for Better Conversations and Disagreements</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/use-rapoports-rules-for-better-conversations-and-disagreements/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2019 17:06:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/use-rapoports-rules-for-better-conversations-and-disagreements/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m reading Walter Sinnott-Armstrong’s excellent book, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2BNTlTq">&lt;em>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community.

&lt;p>Mr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Grain of the Gospel: Why Christians Should Care about Food Ethics</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-grain-of-the-gospel-why-christians-should-care-about-food-ethics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 06:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-grain-of-the-gospel-why-christians-should-care-about-food-ethics/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The following is a guest post written by my friend and former college roommate, &lt;strong>Zak Weston&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>Why am I an Anglican Christian? Here are 3 reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="1-anglicanism-as-a-refuge-from-fundamentalism">1. Anglicanism as a Refuge from Fundamentalism&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>First, for me, Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism. Now, to be sure, we do have our own fundamentalists within the Anglican Communion! But, compared to some “ingrown enclaves” I’ve experienced in my Christian upbringing, Anglicanism has been a breath of fresh air. It has been an ecclesiological space for healing as I seek to “&lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/08/on-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater-a-message-for-abused-ex-fundamentalists/">not throw the (gospel) baby out with the (fundamentalist) bathwater&lt;/a>.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cut the "Positivity" Crap: What Frustrates You?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/cut-positivity-crap-frustrates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 17:06:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/cut-positivity-crap-frustrates/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ll keep this short, sweet, and to the point: &lt;strong>I’m looking for problems that I can help solve, so I need you to rant at me in the comments.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s right, I basically want you to complain to me in the comments section of this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What’s causing you frustration, angst, or stress these days?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What questions are you struggling to find the answers to?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What obstacles are in the way of you achieving your goals?&lt;/li>

If you only have a minute to read about wealth, here’s my argument in a nutshell:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="outline-of-my-argument">Outline of My Argument&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Main Claim: American Christians should reduce their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor and oppressed.&lt;/strong>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>God is the firmest advocate for human flourishing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The pursuit of wealth is spiritually dangerous and crippling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our culture’s inclinations toward upward financial mobility go against the message of the New Testament and the life of Christ.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God is revealed in Scripture to have a special concern for the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Christians will be held accountable for how they treat the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Objections:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>This line of reasoning is advocating asceticism and is unbiblical.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Christians have every right to keep what they have earned and to do what they wish with their excess funds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because the poor are lazy, Christians should not feel pressured to give, in case their generosity is taken advantage of.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warrant:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Christians want to remain true to Scripture and submit to God’s way of life in order to find satisfaction.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>However, I am a follower of Jesus, and one of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning this semester is that &lt;u>&lt;strong>praise&lt;/strong>&lt;/u>, &lt;u>&lt;strong>thanksgiving&lt;/strong>&lt;/u>, and &lt;u>&lt;strong>gratitude&lt;/strong>&lt;/u> are closely intertwined. Worship should involve the public proclamation of who God is and what He has done — including specific, personal declarations of thanksgiving for God&amp;rsquo;s grace and good gifts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If, like me, you have a hard time cultivating this worshipful practice of gratitude, then allow me to suggest the following prayers from the &lt;a href="http://www.bcponline.org/">Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a> to help get us started.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My 2014 Regional ETS Paper: Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-2014-regional-ets-paper-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 09:01:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-2014-regional-ets-paper-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you’re interested, here’s &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/steele-southeast-ets-2014-paper-final-presesntation-edit.pdf">the latest version of the Regional ETS paper&lt;/a> I will present today at 5:00pm at Beeson Divinity School, room S009.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Nevertheless, pacifists, at least the ones I know, can be very enthusiastic about the rightness of their cause. Since &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;">there is no rational justification for pacifism&lt;/span>, defenders typically turn their rhetoric against their critics by casting them as stooges of the status quo. Since pacifists are against all forms of violence, anyone who disagrees with them must be in favor of violence. What this ploy misses is obvious.

&lt;p>Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inductive Bible Study in 7 Steps: "Scripture, Handle With Care," by Amy Chase Ashley</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/inductive-bible-study-7-steps-amy-chase-ashley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2013 00:34:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/inductive-bible-study-7-steps-amy-chase-ashley/</guid><description>&lt;address>Update (April 2017): I’ve gone back to update/clean-up the formatting in this wonderful June 2013 guest post on the basics of inductive Bible study from my friend **Amy Elizabeth Chase Ashley,** one of the most gifted students of Scripture with whom I’ve been privileged to study.

Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Book of Romans, Distilled and Paraphrased</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/romans-distilled-paraphrased/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2012 14:02:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/romans-distilled-paraphrased/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="romans-11-17">Romans 1:1-17&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you don’t catch anything else from what I’m about to say, remember this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>God is righteous. He is just. He is faithful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>God has proven himself faithful to his promises of restoring the world, working through his faithful Son, the Messiah, to bring about both our faith in and our faithfulness to him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unity?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/unity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2012 19:22:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/unity/</guid><description>&lt;p>The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I’ve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Good News of Christmas</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-good-news-of-christmas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2011 13:31:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-good-news-of-christmas/</guid><description>&lt;p>After reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031049298X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=faithinirelan-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399373&amp;amp;creativeASIN=031049298X">The King Jesus Gospel: The Original Good News Revisited&lt;/a> by Scot McKnight, who makes the claim that the gospel is the saving story of Jesus as Messiah, King, and Lord as the completion to the story of Israel, I started to notice some profound gospel messages in the Christmas carols we often sing during this season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have found that several of these carols go much deeper (much more biblical) than the personal salvation “gospel” of sin-management that we often preach and sing about. What’s tragic is that, even though these carols are quite possibly the best-known Christian songs, their familiarity (and the fact that we only break them out for 1/12th of the year), makes it quite easy to ignore their substance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Church and State</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/church_and_state/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 12:23:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/church_and_state/</guid><description>&lt;p>(Note: for a more recent piece on the relationship between Church and State, see my essay: “&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2015/12/08/improvising-church-state/">Improvising Church and State&lt;/a>.”)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just read an article by Kevin DeYoung at The Gospel Coalition: &lt;a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/05/26/thinking-theologically-about-memorial-day/?comments#comments">“Thinking Theologically About Memorial Day”&lt;/a>. Listen to his intro:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This post probably has something to make everyone unhappy. But here goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Memorial Day on Monday (in the U.S.) and, no doubt, a number of patriotic services scheduled for this Sunday, I want to offer a few theses on patriotism and the church. Each of these points could be substantially expanded and beg more detailed defense and explanation, but since this is a blog and not a term paper, I’ll try to keep this under 1500 words.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What the Bible Says About Poverty: The Book of Proverbs</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/bible-poverty-proverbs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2011 23:44:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/bible-poverty-proverbs/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction-poverty-and-wealth">Introduction: Poverty and Wealth&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
