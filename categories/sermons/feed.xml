&lt;p>I hate waiting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ask anyone who knows me. I am absolutely horrible when it comes to delayed gratification. I’ve been known to open new boxes of cereal on the way home from the store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I hate staying awake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who really cares about the Trinity in 2020?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/who-really-cares-about-the-trinity-in-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 13:02:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/who-really-cares-about-the-trinity-in-2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>(&lt;a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/who-really-cares-about-the-trinity-josh-steele/">To listen to the audio of this sermon as it was preached on June 6, 2020, click here.&lt;/a>)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Christians believe that there is one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or, as my daughter Eva put it recently after seeing a picture in her book, “Father, Son, and Bird.” We’re working on that…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We Christians have been taught that the Trinity is important. No one wants to be a heretic. Trinity, good. Modalism, bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preparing the Way of the Lord in the Wilderness: Luke 3:1-6</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-in-the-wilderness-luke-31-6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 15:42:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-in-the-wilderness-luke-31-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’d like to pray this week’s collect again:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Would you pray with me?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>O God, because without you we are not able to please you—especially in what we say!—mercifully grant that your Holy Spirit may in all things direct and rule our hearts, so that the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts might be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, our strength and our redeemer.

&lt;p>You know, if there’s one thing I hate, it’s goodbyes. Anyone else here hate goodbyes?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yeah, and the fact that I hate them so much means I’m not really very good at goodbyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes I get awkward and silent. Sometimes I get awkward and really chatty! Heck, sometimes I get awkward and I make poor choices, like the one time when I was getting ready to say goodbye to my family when they dropped me off at college.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lasting Supper – Luke 22:14-30</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/maundy-thursday-sermon-the-lasting-supper-luke-2214-30/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:44:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/maundy-thursday-sermon-the-lasting-supper-luke-2214-30/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" controls="controls" id="audio-4235-3" preload="none" style="width: 100%;">&lt;source src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04-13-17JS.mp3?_=3" type="audio/mpeg">&lt;/source>&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04-13-17JS.mp3">https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/04-13-17JS.mp3&lt;/a>&lt;/audio>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is something special about last meals, isn’t there?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d like to show you a series of photographs. These photographs, except for the last one – which I added, are from &lt;a href="http://henryhargreaves.com/no-seconds">a piece called “No Seconds,” and they were put together by Henry Hargreaves&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t want to belabor the artwork with my commentary, so I’ll give you a few seconds to take each slide in.&lt;/p>

The whole idea of a criminal’s last meal affects me deeply. Why?
&lt;p>I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Ahead in God's Upside-Down Kingdom: An Appeal for a Consistently Pro-Life Ethic</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/getting-ahead-in-gods-upside-down-kingdom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 16:27:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/getting-ahead-in-gods-upside-down-kingdom/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" controls="controls" id="audio-4174-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%;">&lt;source src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-29-17JSGeetingAheadinGodsUpsideDownKingdom.mp3?_=2" type="audio/mpeg">&lt;/source>&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-29-17JSGeetingAheadinGodsUpsideDownKingdom.mp3">https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/01-29-17JSGeetingAheadinGodsUpsideDownKingdom.mp3&lt;/a>&lt;/audio>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>promote your &lt;strong>justice&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>embody your &lt;strong>steadfast faithful love&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Together, let us pray:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;strong>&lt;em>Amen&lt;/em>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;em>&lt;strong>Amen.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Following Jesus Beyond the Bandwagon</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/following-jesus-beyond-the-bandwagon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 22:34:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/following-jesus-beyond-the-bandwagon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>(A chapel message in a Christian school.)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few things you should know about me:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I am a student at a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> seminary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before that, I went to a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> college.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before that, I went to a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> high school, and a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> middle school.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a &lt;em>Christian&lt;/em> home.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Oh, also: I’m &lt;strong>the world’s worst sports fan&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every week, they’re like, “Josh, did you see the game?!” “Josh, are you going to watch the game?”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Feast of St. James the Apostle: A Homily for Ministers</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-feast-of-st-james-the-apostle-a-homily-for-ministers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 22:18:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-feast-of-st-james-the-apostle-a-homily-for-ministers/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Readings: &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+34%3B+Jeremiah+16%3A14-21%3B+Mark+1%3A14-20&amp;amp;version=NIV">Psalm 34; Jeremiah 16:14-21; Mark 1:14-20&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like so many other feast days – scheduled, as they are, on the days of the namesakes’ deaths – the feast day of St. James the Apostle is &lt;strong>a strong rebuke to our aspirations&lt;/strong>. To our aspirations as human beings, and especially to our aspirations as ministers of Christ’s Church.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have preached twice in the past month on &lt;a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032">Psalm 32&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey!

&lt;p>So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/12-28-14JoshSteeleHolyInnocents.mp3">Today is December 28&lt;/a> (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents">The Slaughter of the Innocents&lt;/a>,” the killing of the baby boys of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem">Bethlehem&lt;/a> by King &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great">Herod&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back &lt;a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07419a.htm">to at least the fifth century&lt;/a>. In the fourth century, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatius">Chromatius&lt;/a> described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf. Around the same time, St. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine&lt;/a> claimed that these nameless victims, “&lt;em>&lt;strong>whom Herod’s cruelty tore as sucklings from their mothers’ bosom are justly hailed as the infant martyr flowers, the first buds of the church killed by the frost of persecution. They died not only for Christ but in his stead&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Sermon: Our Help</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-sermon-our-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 14:06:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-sermon-our-help/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey internet: I was recently given the chance to preach at my church, &lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/">St. Peter’s Anglican&lt;/a>, on the &lt;a href="http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25">Second Sunday of Lent&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3">sermon audio is now online&lt;/a>. If you’ve got 23 minutes to spare, &lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3">give it a listen&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, &lt;a href="http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25">here are the passages&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Psalm 121&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Genesis 12:1-4&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Romans 4:1-5, 13-17&lt;/li>
&lt;li>John 3:1-17&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Then, make sure to &lt;strong>ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37&lt;/strong>&lt;a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3"> in the audio&lt;/a>, I departed from my notes — which ended at “Nicodemus then fades from the narrative,” (which he does in the passage at hand) — and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again. As I was quickly reminded after the service, &lt;strong>he does appear twice more in John’s Gospel&lt;/strong>. Oops! Next time I’ll stick to my notes and not make any extemporaneous comments about minor characters without thinking through the context first.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>(Un)Righteous Anger? – Yoda, Jonah, Nahum, and Us</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/unrighteous-anger-yoda-jonah-nahum-and-us/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2013 21:18:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/unrighteous-anger-yoda-jonah-nahum-and-us/</guid><description>&lt;p>(TEXTS: &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah%203:5-10;%204:1-11;%20Nahum%201:1-8&amp;amp;version=NET">Jonah 3:5-10; 4:1-11; Nahum 1:1-8&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A great green theologian of old claimed that anger is based on fear, that it leads to hatred, and results in suffering. And while I do not wish to disregard the wisdom of a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I would like to take a closer look at anger as discussed in Scripture, and to consider what makes certain instances of anger righteous or unrighteous, legitimate or illegitimate.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
