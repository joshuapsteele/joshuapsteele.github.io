Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Death in His Grave</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/death-in-his-grave/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 20:49:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/death-in-his-grave/</guid><description>&lt;p>With Holy Week and Easter coming up, I’ve been thinking about music and artwork that I’ve found particularly poignant when reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I’ve seen many icons of the resurrection (“anastasis,” in Greek) like the one below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I don’t think I fully appreciated the image until I realized it was Adam and Eve that Christ is helping up out of their graves. He’s trampled down the doors/gates of Hell and is taking an elderly Adam and an elderly Eve by the hand. Rescuing them from the realm of Death, in order to bring them back to eternal life with God.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>25 Possibly Unpopular Opinions about Church</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/25-possibly-unpopular-opinions-about-church/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:42:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/25-possibly-unpopular-opinions-about-church/</guid><description>&lt;p>The following are some of my opinions, held with varying levels of intensity, about church/churches.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many churches in the USA are too “busy.” They are trying to do too many different things and should instead refocus on the church’s proper priorities (Word and Sacraments).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Logos 10 Bible Software: The Ultimate Theological Learning Tool</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/logos-10-bible-software-the-ultimate-theological-learning-tool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/logos-10-bible-software-the-ultimate-theological-learning-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR: If you’re serious about biblical and theological studies, you should invest in Logos 10 Bible Software. &lt;a href="https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;amp;AFID=529204">Do so via my exclusive partner offer for Logos 10 here!&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Quit laughing at &lt;em>How to Read a Book&lt;/em> by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Almost every time we post something about women’s ordination, a controversial issue has been whether or not doing so needlessly “stirs the pot,” as in “causes trouble, unrest, dissent.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Help!

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>“theological triage,”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“doctrinal taxonomy,” or&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“dogmatic rank.”&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I’m referring to the process of distinguishing between various levels of importance when it comes to theological statements/positions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, for example, the Trinity would usually be considered a “first-order” or “primary” doctrine—a “dogma,” if you will. But a specific view of the end times would usually be considered a “second-order,” “secondary,” or “tertiary” doctrine—AKA “adiaphora.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My favorite definition of "theology"</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-favorite-definition-of-theology/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2019 21:35:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-favorite-definition-of-theology/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is from Robert Jenson, &lt;em>Systematic Theology&lt;/em>, Volume 1, p. 11:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The church has a mission: to see to the speaking of the gospel, whether to the world as message of salvation or to God as appeal and praise. Theology is the reflection internal to the church’s labor on this assignment.&lt;/p>

The great crisis in which all worship and piety and adoration and prayer and theology constantly finds itself derives of course from the question whether and how far in these things we really have to do with the true and living God who reveals Himself in His Word, and not with an idol. But this question is decided concretely in practice by another one which is inseparable from it—whether and how far in these things we come before God together and not apart from and against one another. True Christianity cannot be a private Christianity, i.e., a rapacious Christianity. Inhumanity at once makes it a counterfeit Christianity.

&lt;h2 id="introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church">INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”&lt;sup>&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#post-41871-footnote-1">[1]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup> He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.&lt;sup>&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#post-41871-footnote-2">[2]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup> By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I think Karl Barth missed the (pastoral) point of Romans</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/i-think-karl-barth-missed-the-pastoral-point-of-romans/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 15:44:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/i-think-karl-barth-missed-the-pastoral-point-of-romans/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m scheduled to give a paper on Karl Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 in &lt;em>Der Römerbrief&lt;/em> at the &lt;a href="#">2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium&lt;/a> at Princeton in August.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, of course, it’s a pleasure and a privilege to give a paper at the colloquium. However, in hindsight, I don’t know why I thought giving a paper on chapter 10 of Barth’s Römerbrief was a good idea!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Granted, I don’t have to solve all of the exegetical issues (of which there are many) in Romans 9:30–10:21.

In other words, when will God’s kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)? Furthermore, who brings the kingdom about? Humans? God? Or some combination of the two?

&lt;p>Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Author: Geoffrey Turner&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Women's Ordination Debates in Anglicanism: The 2017 ACNA Report and the 2003 AMIA Report</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/womens-ordination-debates-in-anglicanism-the-2017-acna-report-and-the-2003-amia-report/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 14:17:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/womens-ordination-debates-in-anglicanism-the-2017-acna-report-and-the-2003-amia-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>I became an “egalitarian” in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women’s ordination debate within Anglicanism.

However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What's the relationship between biblical and systematic/dogmatic theology?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/whats-the-relationship-between-biblical-and-systematic-dogmatic-theology/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:18:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/whats-the-relationship-between-biblical-and-systematic-dogmatic-theology/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the question we’re considering this week in our doctoral seminar on biblical and theological integration.

Special attention is given to the rationale for these Christian doctrines, their systematic interconnections as well as their development within the history of Christian thought, and their contemporary challenges. This class is your opportunity to reinforce why you believe what you believe and to examine how it impacts your life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Justification and Sanctification</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/justification-and-sanctification/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2018 15:27:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/justification-and-sanctification/</guid><description>&lt;p>For my “Pedagogical Experience” requirement at Wheaton, I’m helping to teach a masters-level Christian Theology course.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>What are the key Christian teachings being articulated? What is the author’s driving concern or main theme?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What counts for the author as authoritative (Scripture, tradition, reason, experience…)? Is the author’s theological method implicit or explicit?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How does the author deal with the witness of Scripture?&lt;br>
a. Implicitly? Explicitly?&lt;br>
b. Does the witness of the Old Testament matter? The New?&lt;br>
c. What biblical themes are privileged?&lt;br>
d. What interpretive principles are at work?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do these claims relate to other doctrines?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How does context (including gender, race, class, culture, and time) shape the theological voice? Is the theologian conscious of this? How does your context shape your evaluation of the piece?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practice reading charitably. What is the best possible interpretation of how the piece reflects an attempt to be faithful to Jesus Christ?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do these theological claims relate to the life of faith? Doe you bring other questions from your experience?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If this theological proposal were taken seriously, how would it shape Christian practice? Would it affect our participation in spiritual disciplines? Our understanding of faithful living? Our practice of evangelism? Our life as the church?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

Vanhoozer, affectionately known by some as “KJV,” has written &lt;a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/08/letter-to-an-aspiring-theologian">one of the best, briefest overviews of what theologians (should) do&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The entire piece is filled with gems like the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To become a theologian, you must be willing to bear true witness and call out false witnesses, casting down idols and ideologies. That’s the shadow side of theology, but the best part is speaking light and truth in astonished indications of God’s goodness. I love John Webster’s definition of theology: “that delightful activity in which the Church praises God by ordering its thinking towards the gospel of Christ.” Being a theologian means getting to have not necessarily the last word, but the word about last things, “the end for which God created the world” (to cite the title of a dissertation by Jonathan Edwards). It’s not only a good word but the best of all possible words, namely, that God glorifies humans and all creation, magnifying his own glory and subjecting all things to the Lordship of Christ, so that “God may be all in all” (1 Cor. 15:28). It’s the privilege of the theologian to bear witness to the length, depth, breadth, and width of the cross and Resurrection. Karl Barth is right: “The theologian who has no joy in his work is not a theologian at all.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Attracts People to Anglicanism?

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Two More Pieces about Jordan Peterson</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/two-more-pieces-about-jordan-peterson/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 19:08:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/two-more-pieces-about-jordan-peterson/</guid><description>&lt;p>Previously, &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/what-to-make-of-jordan-peterson-some-takes-then-my-own/">I catalogued a bunch of different takes on Jordan Peterson, before giving my own take&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since that post, two other pieces about Jordan Peterson have been written that I’d like to share.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="jordan-peterson-custodian-of-the-patriarchy-by-nellie-bowles-new-york-times">“Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy,” by Nellie Bowles (New York Times)&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html">Nellie Bowles writes&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Mr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What to make of Jordan Peterson?

&lt;p>Theological &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics">hermeneutics&lt;/a> – human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God – faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Christians and Wealth: An Argument for Downward Mobility</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/christians-and-wealth-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2016 01:00:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/christians-and-wealth-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Great news! If you only have a minute to read about wealth, here’s my argument in a nutshell:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h1 id="outline-of-my-argument">Outline of My Argument&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Main Claim: American Christians should reduce their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor and oppressed.&lt;/strong>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>God is the firmest advocate for human flourishing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The pursuit of wealth is spiritually dangerous and crippling.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our culture’s inclinations toward upward financial mobility go against the message of the New Testament and the life of Christ.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>God is revealed in Scripture to have a special concern for the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Christians will be held accountable for how they treat the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Objections:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>This line of reasoning is advocating asceticism and is unbiblical.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Christians have every right to keep what they have earned and to do what they wish with their excess funds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because the poor are lazy, Christians should not feel pressured to give, in case their generosity is taken advantage of.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warrant:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Christians want to remain true to Scripture and submit to God’s way of life in order to find satisfaction.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>What am I getting at? Am I calling the Church a mere “club”?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No. Although, unfortunately, it often feels that way, doesn’t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A club full of hypocrisy, idolatry, indifference, and platitudes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A club full of power-plays, fear-mongering, and Bible-thumping.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A club full of saints too afraid to admit that they are sinners.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>From the church’s perspective, is the state a promising offer, or a threatening one?

&lt;p>Just as sin is ontological impossibility, disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. The tension between the undeniable reality of sin and Karl Barth’s theological definition of sin as an impossible possibility parallels the tension between the obvious reality of a fractured church1 and the theological definition of the church as the one body of the one Christ. Two excerpts from the Barthian corpus legitimize this connection. First, in his prepared remarks to the 1937 Second World Conference on Faith and Order in Edinburgh, Karl Barth maintained that&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Karl Barth on the Wilderness Temptations: #1, Stones into Bread</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 09:13:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth">Karl Barth&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> exegesis of &lt;a href="http://postbarthian.com/2013/07/17/karl-barth-on-the-temptation-of-jesus-in-the-wilderness/">Christ&amp;rsquo;s wilderness temptations&lt;/a> isperenniallyinspiring, but particularly poignant during this season of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent">Lent&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus&amp;rsquo; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Christ&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">first temptation was to turn stones into bread&lt;/a>, thereby using divine power as a &amp;ldquo;technical instrument&amp;rdquo; to save and maintain his own life.

&lt;p>It is a particularly appropriate discussion for this season of&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent">Lent&lt;/a>, for Jesus was not tempted to break the Law or commit a moral infraction. Instead, he was tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For Barth, if Christ had capitulated to any of the temptations, he would have abandoned God&amp;rsquo;s redemptive mission.

&lt;p>Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You're Reading Romans 13 Wrong!

It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creation and Doxology: A Portrait of Biblical Creation Theology (pt. 3)</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2012 08:08:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>(Read &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/17/creation-and-doxology-pt-1/" title="Creation and Doxology (pt. 1)">Pt. 1&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/17/creation-and-doxology-pt-2/" title="Creation and Doxology (pt. 2)">Pt. 2 &lt;/a>first!)&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="creation-and-redemption-christ-and-new-creation">CREATION AND REDEMPTION: CHRIST AND NEW CREATION&lt;/h1>
&lt;div>Throughout the New Testament, the main use of creation theology is to link creation with redemption, resulting in the praise of the Creator through the Creator-Redeemer, Jesus the Messiah. However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions.[\[1\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1) The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple.[\[2\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2) Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.
&lt;p>The New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17).&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]&lt;/a> In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation.&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]&lt;/a> Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20).&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]&lt;/a> Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both &lt;em>made&lt;/em> (poievw).&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creation and Doxology: A Portrait of Biblical Creation Theology (pt. 2)</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 20:19:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/17/creation-and-doxology-pt-1/" title="Creation and Doxology (pt. 1)">(Read Pt. 1 First!)&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="creation-complexity-and-chaos">CREATION, COMPLEXITY, AND CHAOS&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Much of the chaos in the universe can be ascribed to the infiltration of Sin and Death as described in Genesis 3. However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God’s creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creation and Doxology: A Portrait of Biblical Creation Theology (pt. 1)</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 17:07:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In many conservative evangelical circles, biblical creation theology has been hijacked and eclipsed by the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism.&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1">[1]&lt;/a> It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology. Waltke summarizes the problem well: “Instead of metaphysical questions that shape culture, questions about dinosaurs, a young earth theory, and such dominate the evangelical landscape. This is unfortunate.”&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2">[2]&lt;/a> Nevertheless, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Scripture’s use of creation themes, whether the evangelical community gives them appropriate attention or not. Unfortunately, a comprehensive analysis of biblical creation theology, a field fertile enough to provide lifetimes of work and study, far exceeds the purview of this essay.&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.github.io/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]&lt;/a> However, a brief analysis of the motifs of creation as temple, chaos, and redemption will show that the overarching use of creation theology in Scripture is to bring about the praise of the Creator. Biblical creation theology, properly understood, leads to doxology.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unity?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/unity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2012 19:22:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/unity/</guid><description>&lt;p>The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have found that several of these carols go much deeper (much more biblical) than the personal salvation “gospel” of sin-management that we often preach and sing about. What’s tragic is that, even though these carols are quite possibly the best-known Christian songs, their familiarity (and the fact that we only break them out for 1/12th of the year), makes it quite easy to ignore their substance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Church and State</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/church_and_state/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 12:23:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/church_and_state/</guid><description>&lt;p>(Note: for a more recent piece on the relationship between Church and State, see my essay: “&lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2015/12/08/improvising-church-state/">Improvising Church and State&lt;/a>.”)&lt;/p>
