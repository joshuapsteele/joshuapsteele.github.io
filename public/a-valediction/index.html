Let me know what you think!\nGRADUATION! Such a mix of emotions comes with this simple word…\nStudents are exhilarated to finally be done with yet another chapter of their lives.\nParents are also excited, yet saddened perhaps by the fact that their little babies are now about to embark into the real world.\nFaculty are relieved to get such a motley group of troublemakers out of their school!Guests are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony,\nGuests are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony, which is customarily concluded by a farewell address from the graduating valedictorian:\nA poor individual who must say goodbye while also addressing all parties and emotions involved, all within the space of a short speech.\nFortunately, Mrs. Covrett, my English teacher, taught me that poetry is the language of both emotion and economy.\nEarlier this year, amidst the trials and tribulations of AP English Literature and Composition, we read a poem entitled “A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning.”\nThis poem, written by John Donne about a love that transcends physical separation between him and his beloved, inspired me to compose my own work in the interests of avoiding both triteness and plagiarism on this most auspicious occasion.\nNow, John Donne forbade his beloved from openly mourning his departure.\nWhile I do not think it fitting for me to forbid anyone anything, please indulge me a few moments of your time as we look both back at the past and ahead into the future by way of my poem, entitled:\nA VALEDICTION The years, a road before us\nThis school, the path behind\nAnd who can know what lies ahead?\nThe twists and turns we’ll find\nOur time, it passes swiftly,\nThis life will soon be gone\nWhen we look back upon our days,\nWhat is it we’ll have done?\nThe world has many pleasures\nits riches and its fame\nYet none of these are lasting treasures\nfor all face death the same\nWe’ve all one life to use now,\nOur time will soon be past\nAnd though this world will pass away,\nWhat’s done for Christ will last.\nFor years, we’ve learned and grown here,\na foundation has been laid.\nThe future looms before us now,\na choice has to be made:\nTo waste our lives upon ourselves?\nTo build on sinking sand?\nOr found ourselves upon the Rock,\nWho holds us in His hands?\nThe choice may seem quite simple now,\nas though the battle’s won,\nbut day by day, the world cries out\n“Don’t fret! Go play! Have fun!”\nOur lives will have their share of joy,\nGood gifts from God each day.\nBut don’t be fooled, there’s pain as well\nThere’s bumps along our way.\nShould we be scared? Can we succeed?\nIs there hope amidst the fear?\nWill we press on? or stop to heed\nthose voices in our ear:\n“Turn back! This way is difficult!\nIt’s much too hard for you!\nToo frightening, there’s no comfort there,\nYou’ll never make it through!”\nDon’t stop! Press on! For don’t we know?\nand have not we been told?\nIt’s only through the fire\nYou obtain the purest gold.\nWe have a God in Heaven\nA Father and a Guide\nHe gives the strength to carry on\nTo those who would reside\nin Him. we find our purpose\nIn Him we find the way\nto live our lives unwasted\n,to boldly face each day.\nFor He alone knows how much time\nwe have to walk the road\nAnd He alone knows every trial,\nThe weight of each our loads\nThough high school is now over\nWe’ve so much more to do!\nThe door has been flung-open,\nand now we must walk through–\nWe’ll miss the loving people here\nWho’ve helped us on our way.\nThough time and distance come between,\nOur thankfulness won’t fade.\nSo, Mom and Dad, we thank you for\nThe time and love you give.\nYou’ve been there through our best and worst\nTo show us how to live.\nOur teachers, better mentors\nWe would be hard-pressed to find.\nThey’ve taught us both to seek the Truth\nAnd always guard our minds.\nSo many more deserve our thanks,\nYet words cannot convey\nThe boundless debt of gratitude\nThat we should rightly pay.\nAnd now we say “farewell”\n“Goodbye,” as we depart.\nOne journey ends, another’s here\non which we must embark.\n(For another original poem of mine, check out “From a Grateful Son,” which I wrote for my mother on Mother’s Day in 2009.)\n",

<p>The following is my valedictorian speech, delivered at my high school graduation in 2009. As you’ll see below, the majority of the speech was an original poem. Sure, I’m tempted to be a bit embarrassed by the poem today, but I’m also proud that I went for it. Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Such a mix of emotions comes with this simple word…</p>
<p><strong>Students</strong> are exhilarated to finally be done with yet another chapter of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Parents</strong> are also excited, yet saddened perhaps by the fact that their little babies are now about to embark into the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty</strong> are relieved to get such a motley group of troublemakers out of their school!Guests are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony,</p>
<p><strong>Guests</strong> are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony, which is customarily concluded by a farewell address from the graduating <strong>valedictorian</strong>:</p>
<p>A poor individual who must say goodbye while also addressing all parties and emotions involved, all within the space of a short speech.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mrs. Covrett, my English teacher, taught me that <strong>poetry</strong> is the language of both emotion and economy.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, amidst the trials and tribulations of AP English Literature and Composition, we read a poem entitled <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44131/a-valediction-forbidding-mourning">“A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning</a>.”</p>
<p>This poem, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne">John Donne</a> about a love that transcends physical separation between him and his beloved, inspired me to compose my own work in the interests of avoiding both triteness and plagiarism on this most auspicious occasion.</p>
<p>Now, John Donne forbade his beloved from openly mourning his departure.</p>
<p>While I do not think it fitting for me to forbid anyone anything, please indulge me a few moments of your time as we look both back at the past and ahead into the future by way of my poem, entitled:</p>
<h1 id="a-valediction">A VALEDICTION<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-valediction">#</a></h1>
<p>The years, a road before us<br>
This school, the path behind<br>
And who can know what lies ahead?<br>
The twists and turns we’ll find</p>
<p>Our time, it passes swiftly,<br>
This life will soon be gone<br>
When we look back upon our days,<br>
What is it we’ll have done?</p>
<p>The world has many pleasures<br>
its riches and its fame<br>
Yet none of these are lasting treasures<br>
for all face death the same</p>
<p>We’ve all one life to use now,<br>
Our time will soon be past<br>
And though this world will pass away,<br>
What’s done for Christ will last.</p>
<p>For years, we’ve learned and grown here,<br>
a foundation has been laid.<br>
The future looms before us now,<br>
a choice has to be made:</p>
<p>To waste our lives upon ourselves?<br>
To build on sinking sand?<br>
Or found ourselves upon the Rock,<br>
Who holds us in His hands?</p>
<p>The choice may seem quite simple now,<br>
as though the battle’s won,<br>
but day by day, the world cries out<br>
“Don’t fret! Go play! Have fun!”</p>
<p>Our lives will have their share of joy,<br>
Good gifts from God each day.<br>
But don’t be fooled, there’s pain as well<br>
There’s bumps along our way.</p>
<p>Should we be scared? Can we succeed?<br>
Is there hope amidst the fear?<br>
Will we press on? or stop to heed<br>
those voices in our ear:</p>
<p>“Turn back! This way is difficult!<br>
It’s much too hard for you!<br>
Too frightening, there’s no comfort there,<br>
You’ll never make it through!”</p>
<p>Don’t stop! Press on! For don’t we know?<br>
and have not we been told?<br>
It’s only through the fire<br>
You obtain the purest gold.</p>
<p>We have a God in Heaven<br>
A Father and a Guide<br>
He gives the strength to carry on<br>
To those who would reside</p>
<p>in Him. we find our purpose<br>
In Him we find the way<br>
to live our lives unwasted<br>
,to boldly face each day.</p>
<p>For He alone knows how much time<br>
we have to walk the road<br>
And He alone knows every trial,<br>
The weight of each our loads</p>
<p>Though high school is now over<br>
We’ve so much more to do!<br>
The door has been flung-open,<br>
and now we must walk through–</p>
<p>We’ll miss the loving people here<br>
Who’ve helped us on our way.<br>
Though time and distance come between,<br>
Our thankfulness won’t fade.</p>
<p>So, Mom and Dad, we thank you for<br>
The time and love you give.<br>
You’ve been there through our best and worst<br>
To show us how to live.</p>
<p>Our teachers, better mentors<br>
We would be hard-pressed to find.<br>
They’ve taught us both to seek the Truth<br>
And always guard our minds.</p>
<p>So many more deserve our thanks,<br>
Yet words cannot convey<br>
The boundless debt of gratitude<br>
That we should rightly pay.</p>
<p>And now we say “farewell”<br>
“Goodbye,” as we depart.<br>
One journey ends, another’s here<br>
on which we must embark.</p>
