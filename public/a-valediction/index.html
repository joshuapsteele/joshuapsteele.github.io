Let me know what you think!\nGRADUATION! Such a mix of emotions comes with this simple word…\nStudents are exhilarated to finally be done with yet another chapter of their lives.\nParents are also excited, yet saddened perhaps by the fact that their little babies are now about to embark into the real world.\nFaculty are relieved to get such a motley group of troublemakers out of their school!Guests are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony,\nGuests are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony, which is customarily concluded by a farewell address from the graduating valedictorian:\nA poor individual who must say goodbye while also addressing all parties and emotions involved, all within the space of a short speech.\nFortunately, Mrs. Covrett, my English teacher, taught me that poetry is the language of both emotion and economy.\nEarlier this year, amidst the trials and tribulations of AP English Literature and Composition, we read a poem entitled “A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning.”\nThis poem, written by John Donne about a love that transcends physical separation between him and his beloved, inspired me to compose my own work in the interests of avoiding both triteness and plagiarism on this most auspicious occasion.\nNow, John Donne forbade his beloved from openly mourning his departure.\nWhile I do not think it fitting for me to forbid anyone anything, please indulge me a few moments of your time as we look both back at the past and ahead into the future by way of my poem, entitled:\nA VALEDICTION The years, a road before us\nThis school, the path behind\nAnd who can know what lies ahead?\nThe twists and turns we’ll find\nOur time, it passes swiftly,\nThis life will soon be gone\nWhen we look back upon our days,\nWhat is it we’ll have done?\nThe world has many pleasures\nits riches and its fame\nYet none of these are lasting treasures\nfor all face death the same\nWe’ve all one life to use now,\nOur time will soon be past\nAnd though this world will pass away,\nWhat’s done for Christ will last.\nFor years, we’ve learned and grown here,\na foundation has been laid.\nThe future looms before us now,\na choice has to be made:\nTo waste our lives upon ourselves?\nTo build on sinking sand?\nOr found ourselves upon the Rock,\nWho holds us in His hands?\nThe choice may seem quite simple now,\nas though the battle’s won,\nbut day by day, the world cries out\n“Don’t fret! Go play! Have fun!”\nOur lives will have their share of joy,\nGood gifts from God each day.\nBut don’t be fooled, there’s pain as well\nThere’s bumps along our way.\nShould we be scared? Can we succeed?\nIs there hope amidst the fear?\nWill we press on? or stop to heed\nthose voices in our ear:\n“Turn back! This way is difficult!\nIt’s much too hard for you!\nToo frightening, there’s no comfort there,\nYou’ll never make it through!”\nDon’t stop! Press on! For don’t we know?\nand have not we been told?\nIt’s only through the fire\nYou obtain the purest gold.\nWe have a God in Heaven\nA Father and a Guide\nHe gives the strength to carry on\nTo those who would reside\nin Him. we find our purpose\nIn Him we find the way\nto live our lives unwasted\n,to boldly face each day.\nFor He alone knows how much time\nwe have to walk the road\nAnd He alone knows every trial,\nThe weight of each our loads\nThough high school is now over\nWe’ve so much more to do!\nThe door has been flung-open,\nand now we must walk through–\nWe’ll miss the loving people here\nWho’ve helped us on our way.\nThough time and distance come between,\nOur thankfulness won’t fade.\nSo, Mom and Dad, we thank you for\nThe time and love you give.\nYou’ve been there through our best and worst\nTo show us how to live.\nOur teachers, better mentors\nWe would be hard-pressed to find.\nThey’ve taught us both to seek the Truth\nAnd always guard our minds.\nSo many more deserve our thanks,\nYet words cannot convey\nThe boundless debt of gratitude\nThat we should rightly pay.\nAnd now we say “farewell”\n“Goodbye,” as we depart.\nOne journey ends, another’s here\non which we must embark.\n(For another original poem of mine, check out “From a Grateful Son,” which I wrote for my mother on Mother’s Day in 2009.)\n","wordCount":"814","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://joshuapsteele.com/images/default-social.png","datePublished":"2009-06-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-03-31T16:22:26-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"joshuapsteele"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joshuapsteele.com/a-valediction/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joshua P.
