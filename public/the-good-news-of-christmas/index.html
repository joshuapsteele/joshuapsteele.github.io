<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hark! The herald angels sing,</strong><br>
<strong>“Glory to the newborn King;</strong><br>
<strong>Peace on earth, and mercy mild,</strong><br>
<strong>God and sinners reconciled!”</strong><br>
<strong>Joyful, all ye nations rise,</strong><br>
<strong>Join the triumph of the skies;</strong><br>
<strong>With th’angelic host proclaim,</strong><br>
<strong>“Christ is born in Bethlehem!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hark! the herald angels sing,</strong><br>
<strong>“Glory to the newborn King!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Christ, by highest Heav’n adored;</strong><br>
<strong>Christ the everlasting Lord;</strong><br>
<strong>Late in time, behold Him come,</strong><br>
<strong>Offspring of a virgin’s womb.</strong><br>
<strong>Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;</strong><br>
<strong>Hail th’incarnate Deity,</strong><br>
<strong>Pleased with us in flesh to dwell,</strong><br>
<strong>Jesus our Emmanuel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hail the heav’nly Prince of Peace!</strong><br>
<strong>Hail the Sun of Righteousness!</strong><br>
<strong>Light and life to all He brings,</strong><br>
<strong>Ris’n with healing in His wings.</strong><br>
<strong>Mild He lays His glory by,</strong><br>
<strong>Born that man no more may die.</strong><br>
<strong>Born to raise the sons of earth,</strong><br>
<strong>Born to give them second birth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Come, Desire of nations, come,</strong><br>
<strong>Fix in us Thy humble home;</strong><br>
<strong>Rise, the woman’s conqu’ring Seed,</strong><br>
<strong>Bruise in us the serpent’s head.</strong><br>
<strong>Now display Thy saving power,</strong><br>
<strong>Ruined nature now restore;</strong><br>
<strong>Now in mystic union join</strong><br>
<strong>Thine to ours, and ours to Thine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface,</strong><br>
<strong>Stamp Thine image in its place:</strong><br>
<strong>Second Adam from above,</strong><br>
<strong>Reinstate us in Thy love.</strong><br>
<strong>Let us Thee, though lost, regain,</strong><br>
<strong>Thee, the Life, the inner man:</strong><br>
<strong>O, to all Thyself impart,</strong><br>

<p>May your hearts and minds be set upon Jesus the Messiah, King, Lord, Savior, and Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>And may you all, in doing so, have a very Merry Christmas.</p>
