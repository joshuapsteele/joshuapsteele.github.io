Wartick’s post, “Do Egalitarians Take the Bible Seriously?,” over at Scot McKnight’s Jesus Creed blog.)\nThis is patently false. It is a refusal to admit the complexities of this debate. It is a violation of the hermeneutical principle of charity.\nI would also suggest that this uncharitable claim that the mutualists don’t have a high view of Scripture or Church tradition is what Will Witt has labeled a “non-theological argument against the ordination of women.”\nNOTE: I am *not* suggesting that hierarchicalist’s Scriptural arguments are non-theological. To do so would be exactly the same kind of uncharitable dismissal that I have a problem with. Each scriptural argument, each passage in question deserves careful debate.\nBut what I am claiming is that it is a serious mistake—one which derails the possibility for a legitimate conversation to continue—for hierarchicalists to simply ignore or impugn the careful work of mutualist biblical scholars and theologians.\nHierarchicalists ought not to claim that the mountain of biblical, historical, and theological work that’s been done in support of mutualism doesn’t at least represent an attempt to take the Bible and tradition seriously.\nConsider, as a starting point, the mutualist work in the following resources.\nFirst, if you don’t have a lot of time, then just look through Pierce and Groothius (editors), Discovering Biblical Equality: Complementarity Without Hierarchy, Second Edition (InterVarsity Press, 2005). That’s a good one-stop-shop if you’d like to actually engage with biblical and theological mutualist arguments, (instead of pretending like they don’t exist or impugning their motives).\nHere’s what’s in the book:\nIntroduction, Rebecca Merrill Groothuis and Ronald W.

Of course!\nAs a mutualist, I will freely admit that this is a complicated debate. Because neither side has 100% certain, knock-down arguments for their position, both sides would benefit from charitable, robust engagement.\nBut, for the sake of that charitable, robust engagement, please quit claiming that we mutualists don’t care about the Bible or Church history. That’s every bit as unfair and uncharitable as if we mutualists claimed that all hierarchicalists are misogynists.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>In the ongoing debate about women’s ordination (in the Anglican realm and beyond), I keep hearing oversimplified claims from hierarchicalists (or “complementarians,” but that’s not the most helpful term in this debate) that they have the <em>entirety</em> of the Bible and Church tradition on their side.</p>
<p>Therefore, we mutualists (or “egalitarians,” but that’s not the most helpful term in this debate), it is argued, have arrived at our positions for various reasons—perhaps capitulation to liberal cultural trends and hermeneutical methods—but not because we’ve read Scripture or studied the history of the Church very carefully.</p>
<p>(<em>Related: See <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2017/06/19/egalitarians-take-bible-seriously/">J.W. Wartick’s post, “Do Egalitarians Take the Bible Seriously?,” over at Scot McKnight’s Jesus Creed blog.</a>)</em></p>
<p>This is patently false. It is a refusal to admit the complexities of this debate. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity">violation of the hermeneutical principle of charity</a>.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that this uncharitable claim that the mutualists don’t have a high view of Scripture or Church tradition is what Will Witt has labeled a <a href="http://willgwitt.org/theology/non-theological-arguments-against-the-ordination-of-women/">“non-theological argument against the ordination of women.”</a></p>
<p>NOTE: I am *not* suggesting that hierarchicalist’s <em>Scriptural arguments</em> are non-theological. To do so would be exactly the same kind of uncharitable dismissal that I have a problem with. Each scriptural argument, each passage in question deserves careful debate.</p>
<p>But what I am claiming is that it is a serious mistake—one which derails the possibility for a legitimate conversation to continue—for hierarchicalists to simply ignore or impugn the careful work of mutualist biblical scholars and theologians.</p>
<p>Hierarchicalists ought not to claim that the mountain of biblical, historical, and theological work that’s been done in support of mutualism doesn’t at least represent an attempt to take the Bible and tradition seriously.</p>
<p>Consider, as a starting point, the mutualist work in the following resources.</p>
<p>First, if you don’t have a lot of time, then just look through Pierce and Groothius (editors), <a href="https://amzn.to/2ShMk6H"><em>Discovering Biblical Equality: Complementarity Without Hierarchy,</em></a> Second Edition (InterVarsity Press, 2005). That’s a good one-stop-shop if you’d like to actually engage with biblical and theological mutualist arguments, (instead of pretending like they don’t exist or impugning their motives).</p>
<p>Here’s what’s in the book:</p>

</ul>
<p>Are hierarchicalists free to disagree with the mutualists on particular points and texts? Of course!</p>
<p>As a mutualist, I will freely admit that this is a complicated debate. Because neither side has 100% certain, knock-down arguments for their position, both sides would benefit from charitable, robust engagement.</p>
<p>But, for the sake of that charitable, robust engagement, please quit claiming that we mutualists don’t care about the Bible or Church history. That’s every bit as unfair and uncharitable as if we mutualists claimed that all hierarchicalists are misogynists.</p>
