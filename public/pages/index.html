    <p>“The Rev. Dev.” I’m Josh Steele, a pastor-turned-programmer (“Rev[erend]&#34;-to-“Dev[eloper]”) who solves problems with a programmer’s eye for detail and a pastor’s heart for people.
As a software engineer, I work mainly on backend development in Java, SQL, and Python for a cybersecurity company. But I’m also an ordained Anglican priest (currently resigned from active ministry), trying to figure out what, if anything, to do with three degrees in theology.
After a long time away (for those theology degrees), I’m back in my hometown ofToledo, OH, where I live with my wife and three young children.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>You can add the following caveats to everything I write online.
If it doesn’t directly apply to you, feel free to move along
I’m usually writing for a broad audience and just trying to get people thinking. If I’m interested in starting a debate or argument with a specific individual, I will say so directly. If you think reality is more complicated than what I wrote, you’re right
All communication is an oversimplification of reality. The shorter my post, the more I’ve purposefully left out. I will (almost) never get into extended arguments online
If you still think you really need to say something, write your own post, write me an email, send me a letter, etc. (Just don’t call me, I’m a Millennial!) Finally, I’m just as susceptible to cognitive biases and logical fallacies as anyone else. Nevertheless, I’d like to do my best to stick to the following Rules of Civil Conversation. And I ask that you consider doing the same.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Note: I haven’t updated this “My Story” page in quite some time. Check my “Now” page for more recent updates. But here’s the TL;DR: We’ve got three kids now. I quit my Ph.D. program, resigned from active ministry, and now work full-time as a software engineer. But I’m leaving this old “My Story” page up as a window into how I summarized my story back in 2021.
From Childhood to College God’s faithfulness to me is linked with his faithfulness to my parents. They both grew up in nominally Roman Catholic homes, and came to relationship with Christ shortly before my birth. When I came along, their church environment was a mixture between conservative Baptist and non-denominational. And yet, their departure from the Roman Catholic Church was still recent enough that my grandmother persuaded them to have me baptized as a baby. This was when the first seeds of faith were sown into my life.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>(Note: Since writing this “philosophy of ministry”, I have since resigned from active ministry. I now work full-time as a software engineer, and am trying to discern what my Christian “vocation” looks like, going forward. Nevertheless, I will leave what I’ve written below for posterity.)
Every Christian is a theologian.
I consider it my life’s work to help “everyday Christians” grow in their knowledge and love of God so that we all can put our gifts to good use by joining with God’s redemptive work in the world. In biblical terms, I’m called to “equip the saints for the work of ministry” and to “build up the body of Christ” (Eph. 4:12).
