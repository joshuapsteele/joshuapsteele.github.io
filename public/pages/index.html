Questions I’m Asking (These are in addition to these “self-elicitation” questions, which are always worth asking yourself!)
How do I fix a light switch that doesn’t controll a ceiling light/fan like I want it to? How do I get rid of woodpeckers that keep pecking my house? What’s the best “budget” bidet? What’s the best “budget” smart TV? On a deeper level:

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>(Note: Since writing this “philosophy of ministry”, I have since resigned from active ministry. I now work full-time as a software engineer, and am trying to discern what my Christian “vocation” looks like, going forward. Nevertheless, I will leave what I’ve written below for posterity.)
Every Christian is a theologian.
I consider it my life’s work to help “everyday Christians” grow in their knowledge and love of God so that we all can put our gifts to good use by joining with God’s redemptive work in the world. In biblical terms, I’m called to “equip the saints for the work of ministry” and to “build up the body of Christ” (Eph. 4:12).

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>(Note: for a much briefer profile of what I’m like and what makes me tick as a worker, read this self-assessment.)
From Childhood to College God’s faithfulness to me is linked with his faithfulness to my parents. They both grew up in nominally Roman Catholic homes, and came to relationship with Christ shortly before my birth. When I came along, their church environment was a mixture between conservative Baptist and non-denominational. And yet, their departure from the Roman Catholic Church was still recent enough that my grandmother persuaded them to have me baptized as a baby. This was when the first seeds of faith were sown into my life.
