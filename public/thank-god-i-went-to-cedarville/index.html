Then, it led to the secret summer firing of a professor. I reacted on my blog. Christianity Today picked it up. As well as a local newspaper.

Between my original blogpost and my ‚Äúfinal farewell,‚Äù I tried to take a pretty active role in the student protests against what was going on at CU.\nI‚Äôd like to think we made a bit of a difference ‚Äì perhaps in slowing things down enough to let professors find jobs elsewhere before they got fired. Heck, we even made it into The New York Times. (Although, I will say: I‚Äôm embarrassed of the picture they chose for the article.)\nHowever, in the long run, we failed.\nCedarville is now a much different place than when I arrived. What‚Äôs more, I became so entangled in the mess that I arrived to seminary with some burn wounds ‚Äì from a prophetic fire that burnt a bit too hot.\nI‚Äôm thankful for my time at Cedarville, however.\nGod has been healing those wounds. Beeson Divinity School and Anglicanism have both been balms to my spirit. And, with the healing has come the realization that I would not be who I am today were it not for my four years in Cedarville, Ohio.\nMany of the lessons I learned there were sealed with blood, sweat, and tears ‚Äì as it were. However, those kinds of lessons are often the most important and enduring.\nBy God‚Äôs grace, I hope to carry forward into my future ministry a combination of prophetic fire and patient faithfulness in the face of injustice and suffering.\nHere‚Äôs the thing, though: I‚Äôm worried about the other members of the ‚ÄúCedarville Diaspora.‚Äù ‚ÄúCedarville ex-pats‚Äù? Take your pick of terms.\nNo, not so much the professors who were pushed out. They‚Äôve miraculously landed on their feet, and I‚Äôve witnessed God‚Äôs powerful work of redemption through them in their current careers and ministries.\nNo, I‚Äôm talking about the alumni who got burned by fundamentalism and may have already thrown out the Christian baby with the fundamentalist bathwater. Or perhaps they‚Äôre seriously considering doing so.\nSee, God has blessed me with a wonderful seminary and church community in which to grow and heal after Cedarville. Without those things, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be after the awful ending to my Christian college experience.\nOthers, however, may be feeling very lonely and angry right now.\nIf that‚Äôs you, or if you know someone to whom this applies, would you let me know if there‚Äôs any way I can help you?\nI‚Äôll gladly listen to you vent. I‚Äôd love to pray for you specifically, and perhaps to share what I‚Äôve found helpful along the journey.\n~Josh (@joshuapsteele)\n",

<p>And yet, college also <em><strong>left a bad taste in my mouth</strong></em>.</p>
