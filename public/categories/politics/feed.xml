      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following statements should not be controversial, but they sadly are. What would you add to this list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump lost the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 6th, 2021, was an insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress, not the President (and much less the President&amp;rsquo;s unelected adviser), holds the power of the purse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Judicial branch, and not the Executive branch, interprets the law and the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one, not even the President, is above the law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
