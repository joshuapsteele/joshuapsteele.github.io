      <description>&lt;p&gt;Democracy is not a finished product but an ongoing experiment that demands constant deliberation, refinement, and renewal. The principles I outline here are working principles—I hold them with conviction while recognizing they must evolve through genuine democratic dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/&#34;&gt;constitutional framework in the United States of America&lt;/a&gt; was designed to be amended, our institutions to be improved, and our understanding of justice to deepen with experience and wisdom. The greatest threat to democracy is not disagreement about these principles, but the abandonment of our shared commitment to wrestling with them together in good faith.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democracy is not a finished product but an ongoing experiment that demands constant deliberation, refinement, and renewal. The principles I outline here are working principles—I hold them with conviction while recognizing they must evolve through genuine democratic dialogue.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/">constitutional framework in the United States of America</a> was designed to be amended, our institutions to be improved, and our understanding of justice to deepen with experience and wisdom. The greatest threat to democracy is not disagreement about these principles, but the abandonment of our shared commitment to wrestling with them together in good faith.</p>
<p>While these principles require ongoing refinement, I believe the following foundations are essential for our democracy:</p>
<h2 id="civic-foundations">Civic Foundations</h2>
<h3 id="we-the-people-need-to-know-the-truth">We the people need to know the truth.</h3>
<p>Democracy cannot function without an informed citizenry capable of making reasoned judgments about complex issues. This requires not just access to <a href="https://app.adfontesmedia.com/chart/interactive">accurate information</a>, but the development of <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">critical thinking skills</a> that can distinguish fact from fiction, evidence from opinion, and genuine expertise from manufactured authority.</p>
<h3 id="we-the-people-need-to-want-to-know-the-truth-especially-when-the-truth-is-uncomfortable">We the people need to want to know the truth, especially when the truth is uncomfortable.</h3>
<p>Perhaps more challenging than finding truth is the willingness to accept it when it <a href="https://yourbias.is/">contradicts our preferences or challenges our assumptions</a>. Democratic citizenship demands intellectual courage—the willingness to follow evidence where it leads, even when it unsettles our worldview or implicates us in problems we would rather ignore.</p>
<h3 id="we-the-people-need-to-have-genuine-concern-for-the-welfare-of-our-fellow-citizens-and-our-fellow-humans-even-as-we-each-seek-to-preserve-our-own-welfare">We the people need to have genuine concern for the welfare of our fellow citizens and our fellow humans, even as we each seek to preserve our own welfare.</h3>
<p>Self-interest alone cannot sustain democracy. We must cultivate what the founders called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_virtue">public or civic virtue</a>—a commitment to the common good that transcends narrow personal or tribal interests. This doesn&rsquo;t require pure selflessness, but it does require enlightened self-interest that recognizes our interdependence.</p>
<h3 id="we-need-to-increase-the-civic-obligations-of-citizenship">We need to increase the <a href="https://education.cfr.org/teach/book-guide/bill-obligations-ten-habits-good-citizens">civic obligations of citizenship</a>.</h3>
<p>Rights without responsibilities hollow out democracy from within. Citizens should be expected to serve their communities through jury duty, civic participation, informed voting, and other forms of democratic engagement. A democracy of consumers cannot survive; we need a democracy of active participants.</p>
<h3 id="taxes-are-the-price-of-admission-to-a-functional-society">Taxes are the price of admission to a functional society.</h3>
<p>While we can debate the proper level and distribution of taxation, we cannot escape the fundamental truth that collective goods require collective funding. Roads, schools, courts, defense, environmental protection, and countless other public necessities exist only through shared investment in our common life.</p>
<h2 id="leadership-accountability">Leadership Accountability</h2>
<h3 id="political-leaders-should-be-chosen-based-on-their-demonstrated-virtue-wisdom-and-genuine-concern-for-their-fellow-citizens">Political leaders should be chosen based on their demonstrated virtue, wisdom, and genuine concern for their fellow citizens.</h3>
<p>Popularity, charisma, and partisan loyalty are insufficient qualifications for democratic leadership. We must demand evidence of moral character, practical wisdom, and a proven commitment to serving the public interest rather than personal ambition.</p>
<h3 id="political-leaders-should-be-required-to-demonstrate-an-understanding-of-civics-and-law-that-exceeds-the-basic-requirements-for-citizenship">Political leaders should be required to demonstrate an understanding of civics and law that exceeds the basic requirements for citizenship.</h3>
<p>We expect doctors to understand medicine and teachers to understand education, yet we impose no knowledge requirements on those who would govern us. Leaders should demonstrate competency in constitutional law, economics, history, and the practical arts of democratic governance. As the barest of minimums, they should all be able to pass <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/find-study-materials-and-resources">the naturalization test for citizenship</a>.</p>
<h3 id="political-leaders-should-fear-the-people-more-than-they-fear-the-president-or-party-leadership">Political leaders should fear the people more than they fear the President or party leadership.</h3>
<p>Representatives who serve at the pleasure of party bosses rather than their constituents have abandoned the fundamental principle of democratic accountability. The chain of authority must run from citizens to representatives to leaders, not the reverse.</p>
<h3 id="no-lifetime-appointments-for-any-political-leadership-position">No lifetime appointments for any political leadership position.</h3>
<p>While judicial independence requires some insulation from political pressure, no office should be held in perpetuity. Term limits, regular elections, and mandatory retirement ages ensure that power circulates and that institutions remain responsive to changing circumstances and evolving public will.</p>
<h3 id="political-leaders-should-not-be-allowed-to-become-radically-wealthier-than-the-people-they-represent">Political leaders should not be allowed to become radically wealthier than the people they represent.</h3>
<p>Public service should not be a path to personal enrichment. Leaders who use their positions to accumulate vast wealth inevitably develop interests that diverge from those of ordinary citizens. Reasonable compensation, yes—but extreme wealth accumulation while in office corrupts democratic representation.</p>
<h3 id="political-leaders-should-be-incentivized-with-both-carrots-and-sticks-to-seek-the-common-welfare-above-their-own-personal-gain">Political leaders should be incentivized, with both carrots and sticks, to seek the common welfare above their own personal gain.</h3>
<p>We must restructure the incentives of political life to reward public-spirited behavior and punish corruption. This requires not just legal penalties for wrongdoing, but positive incentives for leaders who demonstrably improve the lives of their constituents.</p>
<h3 id="political-leaders-the-military-and-the-police-should-be-legally-obligated-to-protect-and-serve-the-people-not-just-the-wealthy">Political leaders, the military, and the police should be legally obligated to protect and serve the people, not just the wealthy.</h3>
<p>Equal protection under law means that public servants serve the public—all of it. When institutions of government become the private security forces of economic elites, democracy dies. Our public servants must be accountable to democratic institutions, not to the highest bidder.</p>
<h2 id="electoral-integrity">Electoral Integrity</h2>
<h3 id="it-should-be-as-easy-as-possible-for-all-citizens-to-vote">It should be as easy as possible for all citizens to vote.</h3>
<p>The fundamental act of democratic participation should be accessible to every eligible citizen. Barriers to voting that serve no compelling public interest are barriers to democracy itself. We should be constantly working to expand access, reduce obstacles, and ensure that every voice can be heard.</p>
<h3 id="voting-days-should-be-federal-holidays">Voting days should be federal holidays.</h3>
<p>Democracy requires participation, and participation requires time. Making election days national holidays removes a significant barrier to voting for working people and demonstrates our society&rsquo;s commitment to democratic engagement as a fundamental civic duty.</p>
<h3 id="it-should-only-ever-be-made-more-difficult-to-vote-to-verify-citizenship-or-if-there-is-clear-evidence-of-widespread-voter-fraud">It should only ever be made more difficult to vote to verify citizenship or if there is clear evidence of widespread voter fraud.</h3>
<p>While election integrity matters, restrictions on voting require extraordinary justification. The bar for limiting democratic participation must be high, evidence-based, and focused on genuine threats rather than partisan advantage.</p>
<h3 id="we-need-ranked-choice-voting-in-all-elections">We need ranked-choice voting in all elections.</h3>
<p>Our current system forces false choices between two candidates and creates incentives for negative campaigning and political polarization. Ranked-choice voting allows citizens to express their true preferences while ensuring that winners have broader support and that third parties can compete without being &ldquo;spoilers.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="we-need-to-keep-money-from-having-an-undue-or-hidden-influence-on-politics">We need to keep money from having an undue or hidden influence on politics.</h3>
<p>This includes our information ecosystem—media and news sources that shape public opinion. When wealthy interests can effectively purchase political outcomes through unlimited spending, democracy becomes plutocracy. We must ensure transparency in political funding and limit the ability of concentrated wealth to distort democratic processes.</p>
<h2 id="economic-justice">Economic Justice</h2>
<h3 id="while-allowing-for-plenty-of-variation-in-wealth-and-living-standards-the-wealthy-should-pay-more-taxes-than-the-poor">While allowing for plenty of variation in wealth and living standards, the wealthy should pay more taxes than the poor.</h3>
<p>Progressive taxation reflects both the principle of ability to pay and the recognition that extreme wealth inequality undermines democratic equality. A billionaire and a minimum-wage worker may each have one vote, but if money translates directly into political power, their democratic equality becomes meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-dangerous-and-impossible-to-enforce-equality-of-outcomes-but-we-should-enforce-equality-of-opportunity-and-an-acceptable-range-of-outcomes">It is dangerous and impossible to enforce equality of outcomes, but we should enforce equality of opportunity and an acceptable range of outcomes.</h3>
<p>We should avoid both abject poverty through a robust social safety net and extreme wealth inequality through a graduated tax system with a functional cap on personal wealth.</p>
<p>A society where some live in luxury while others lack basic necessities is not a democracy but an oligarchy. Similarly, when individuals accumulate wealth so vast that they can effectively purchase political systems, democratic equality becomes impossible.</p>
<h3 id="in-view-of-the-many-clear-benefits-of-immigration-and-a-diverse-society-we-need-to-broaden-and-expedite-the-legal-paths-to-residency-and-citizenship">In view of the many clear benefits of immigration and a diverse society, we need to broaden and expedite the legal paths to residency and citizenship.</h3>
<p>America&rsquo;s strength has always come from our ability to integrate diverse peoples into a common democratic project. Immigration policy should reflect both our humanitarian values and our practical need for the energy, skills, and perspectives that newcomers bring.</p>
<h2 id="legal-equality">Legal Equality</h2>
<h3 id="no-one-is-above-the-law">No one is above the law.</h3>
<p>This principle tolerates no exceptions. Wealth, power, position, or political affiliation cannot justify exemption from legal accountability. When leaders believe themselves immune from consequences, the rule of law becomes the rule of power, and democracy dies.</p>
<h3 id="no-one-is-beneath-or-outside-of-the-lawdue-process-for-all">No one is beneath or outside of the law—due process for all.</h3>
<p>Equal justice means that every person, regardless of status, deserves fair treatment under our legal system. This includes not only formal legal protections but also practical access to justice through competent representation and impartial courts.</p>
<hr>
<p>These principles form a coherent vision of democratic renewal, but they are not the final word. Democracy itself demands that we continue to refine, debate, and improve our understanding of what justice and self-governance require. I offer these thoughts not as settled doctrine but as working principles for citizens who believe that democracy is worth defending, worth improving, and worth the hard work of constant democratic dialogue.</p>
<p>The question before us is not whether we will achieve a perfect democracy—we will not. The question is whether we will do the daily work of making democracy more perfect, more just, and more worthy of the sacrifices made to establish and preserve it. That work belongs to all of us, and it begins with the conversations that these principles are meant to start.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try to define (or at least describe) fascism, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascism: &amp;ldquo;a populist political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual, that is associated with a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, and that is characterized by severe economic and social regimentation and by forcible suppression of opposition&amp;rdquo; (Merriam-Webster)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notoriously difficult to define, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/&#34;&gt;Umberto Eco nevertheless highlighted 14 aspects of what he called &amp;ldquo;Ur-Fascism&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Notoriously difficult to define, <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/">Umberto Eco nevertheless highlighted 14 aspects of what he called &ldquo;Ur-Fascism&rdquo;</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cult of Tradition</strong> – A syncretic belief in ancient truths, rejecting modern interpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Rejection of Modernism</strong> – Viewing the Enlightenment and rationalism as the root of moral decline.</li>
<li><strong>Cult of Action for Action’s Sake</strong> – Valuing action over reflection, leading to anti-intellectualism.</li>
<li><strong>Disagreement is Treason</strong> – Suppressing dissent and critical thinking as threats to unity.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of Difference</strong> – Exploiting xenophobia and racism to unify the in-group against outsiders.</li>
<li><strong>Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class</strong> – Mobilizing those feeling economically or socially displaced.</li>
<li><strong>Obsession with a Plot</strong> – Promoting conspiracy theories to justify aggression against perceived enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Enemies are Both Too Strong and Too Weak</strong> – Portraying adversaries as simultaneously formidable and feeble.</li>
<li><strong>Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy</strong> – Viewing life as perpetual warfare, dismissing peace efforts as betrayal.</li>
<li><strong>Contempt for the Weak</strong> – Glorifying strength and dismissing compassion as weakness.</li>
<li><strong>Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero</strong> – Promoting a cult of death and martyrdom.</li>
<li><strong>Machismo</strong> – Elevating aggressive masculinity and denigrating non-conforming sexual behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Selective Populism</strong> – Claiming to represent the unified will of the people, dismissing individual rights.</li>
<li><strong>Newspeak</strong> – Employing an impoverished vocabulary to limit critical thought.</li>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of John Lithgow reading the 20 lessons: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXR5HLodsT8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXR5HLodsT8</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="1-do-not-obey-in-advance">1. Do not obey in advance</h2>
<p>Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.</p>
<h2 id="2-defend-institutions">2. Defend institutions</h2>
<p>It is institutions that help us preserve decency. They need our help as well. Do not speak of &ldquo;our institutions&rdquo; unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions do not protect themselves. They fall one after the other, unless each is defended from the beginning. So choose an institution you care about—a court, a newspaper, a law, a labor union—and take its side.</p>
<h2 id="3-beware-the-one-party-state">3. Beware the one-party state</h2>
<p>The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not omnipotent from the start. They exploited a historic moment to make political life impossible for their opponents. So support the multi-party sysgtem and defend the rules of democratic elections. Vote in local and state elections while you can. Consider running for office.</p>
<h2 id="4-take-responsibility-for-the-face-of-the-world">4. Take responsibility for the face of the world</h2>
<p>The symbols of today enable the reality of tomorrow. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away, and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.</p>
<h2 id="5-remember-professional-ethics">5. Remember professional ethics</h2>
<p>When political leaders set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become more important. It is hard to subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials without judges. Authoritarians need obedient civil servants, and concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in cheap labor.</p>
<h2 id="6-be-wary-of-paramilitaries">6. Be wary of paramilitaries</h2>
<p>When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching with torches and pictures of a leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the end has come.</p>
<h2 id="7-be-reflective-if-you-must-be-armed">7. Be reflective if you must be armed</h2>
<p>If you carry a weapon in public service, may God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no.</p>
<h2 id="8-stand-out">8. Stand out</h2>
<p>Someone has to. It is easy to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. Remember Rosa Parks. The moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.</p>
<h2 id="9-be-kind-to-our-language">9. Be kind to our language</h2>
<p>Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. Make an effort to separate yourself from the internet. Read books.</p>
<h2 id="10-believe-in-truth">10. Believe in truth</h2>
<p>To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.</p>
<h2 id="11-investigate">11. Investigate</h2>
<p>Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on the internet is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate propaganda campaigns (some of which come from abroad). Take responsibility for what you communicate with others.</p>
<h2 id="12-make-eye-contact-and-small-talk">12. Make eye contact and small talk</h2>
<p>This is not just polite. It is part of being a citizen and a responsible member of society. It is also a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down social barriers, and understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.</p>
<h2 id="13-practice-corporeal-politics">13. Practice corporeal politics</h2>
<p>Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.</p>
<h2 id="14-establish-a-private-life">14. Establish a private life</h2>
<p>Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware on a regular basis. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Tyrants seek the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have hooks.</p>
<h2 id="15-contribute-to-good-causes">15. Contribute to good causes</h2>
<p>Be active in organizations, political or not, that express your own view of life. Pick a charity or two and set up autopay. Then you will have made a free choice that supports civil society and helps others to do good.</p>
<h2 id="16-learn-from-peers-in-other-countries">16. Learn from peers in other countries</h2>
<p>Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties in the United States are an element of a larger trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.</p>
<h2 id="17-listen-for-dangerous-words">17. Listen for dangerous words</h2>
<p>Be alert to the use of the words extremism and terrorism. Be alive to the fatal notions of emergency and exception. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.</p>
<h2 id="18-be-calm-when-the-unthinkable-arrives">18. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives</h2>
<p>Modern tyranny is terror management. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that authoritarians exploit such events in order to consolidate power. Do not fall for it.</p>
<h2 id="19-be-a-patriot">19. Be a patriot</h2>

      <description>If the government can take people without due process, none of our rights are safe. Why habeas corpus and due process matter for all of us.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine waking up to find out that your neighbor—a legal immigrant who works hard, pays taxes, and has never been charged with a crime—was taken away in the middle of the night by government agents. No warrant. No lawyer. No hearing. No chance to defend themselves. Just gone.</p>
<p>Then imagine the government claims they’re a danger—but refuses to show any real evidence. And instead of bringing them to a courtroom, they ship them off to a prison in another country.</p>
<p>That’s not a dystopian movie plot. It’s happening <em>right now</em>. And it should terrify every single one of us.</p>
<p>Because when the government can <strong>kidnap without trial</strong>, and lock people up without letting them <strong>have their day in court</strong>, then <em>none</em> of our rights are safe.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-due-process">What Is Due Process?</h2>
<p><strong>Due process</strong> is the basic idea that the government can’t take away your life, your freedom, or your property without following fair procedures. It’s what protects the principle that you are <strong>innocent until proven guilty</strong>.</p>
<p>At a minimum, it means:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get to know what you’re being accused of.</li>
<li>You get a chance to respond.</li>
<li>You have access to a lawyer.</li>
<li>A neutral judge hears the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s your <strong>right to a fair trial</strong>. Without it, everything else collapses.</p>
<p>The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution guarantee due process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-5/">Fifth Amendment</a></strong>: “No person shall… be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/">Fourteenth Amendment</a></strong>: “nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the language: <em>“No person.”</em> Not “no citizen.” Not “no American.” Just <strong>person</strong>. That includes immigrants—documented or undocumented. It includes you. It includes me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-habeas-corpus">What Is Habeas Corpus?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus">Habeas corpus</a></strong> is the right that lets you <strong>demand your day in court</strong> when the government locks you up. It forces the government to explain why you’re being held—and gives you a chance to challenge it.</p>
<p>It’s your protection against being “disappeared” into a jail cell with no explanation, no trial, no accountability.</p>
<p>The Constitution is clear about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/#article-1-section-9-clause-2">Article I, Section 9, Clause 2</a></strong>: “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s no rebellion. And no actual invasion. So why is the government throwing people in foreign prisons without giving them access to a courtroom?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-that-invasion-excuse">About That “Invasion” Excuse</h2>
<p>Lately, politicians and government officials have started calling immigration an <strong>“invasion”</strong> to justify rounding people up without trials. But this isn’t about armies or enemy combatants—it’s about families, workers, and asylum seekers.</p>
<p>And there’s no real evidence backing up the claim.</p>
<ul>
<li>No court has declared an invasion.</li>
<li>No credible threat to public safety has been proven.</li>
<li>Many of the people being detained are <strong>legal residents</strong> with no criminal history.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not about protecting national security. It’s about using fear, racism, and political theater to bypass the rule of law.</p>
<p>Calling it an “invasion” doesn’t make it one. But it <em>does</em> give the government an excuse to test how far they can go without resistance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-should-scare-you">Why This Should Scare You</h2>
<p>You might think: <em>Well, I’m not an immigrant. I’ve done nothing wrong. This doesn’t affect me.</em></p>
<p>But here’s the truth: <strong>if the government can take away someone else’s rights without due process, they can take away yours too.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If they can imprison someone without trial, they can imprison you.</li>
<li>If they can call someone a criminal without proving it, they can do the same to you.</li>
<li>If they can send someone to a foreign prison without a hearing, they can send you there too.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t just about “those people.” It’s about <strong>whether we still believe no one is above the law.</strong></p>
<p>Without due process and habeas corpus, every other right—freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote, the right to privacy—becomes meaningless. There’s no judge to intervene. No courtroom to make your case. No way to push back.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="this-is-a-line-in-the-sand">This Is a Line in the Sand</h2>
<p>This isn’t about left or right. It’s about whether we still believe in <strong>justice</strong>, <strong>accountability</strong>, and <strong>the rule of law</strong>.</p>
<p>If the government can toss the Constitution aside when it’s politically convenient—if it can skip trials, ignore evidence, and detain people in secret—then we are all just <em>one accusation away</em> from losing our freedom.</p>
<p>A government that can <strong>kidnap without trial</strong> is not protecting you. It is testing the limits of its power.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-you-can-do">What You Can Do</h2>
<p>You don’t need to be a lawyer or an activist to stand up for justice. Here are real steps you can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talk about it</strong>. Share this post with your friends, your family, your community. Most people don’t know this is happening.</li>
<li><strong>Call your representatives</strong>. Use <a href="https://5calls.org/">5calls</a> to find your representatives and ask them: What are you doing to protect due process and the rule of law—for everyone?</li>
<li><strong>Demand transparency</strong>. Pressure lawmakers to investigate the use of offshore prisons, secret detentions, and any denial of basic legal rights.</li>
<li><strong>Support civil rights organizations</strong>. Groups like <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">the ACLU</a>, <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>, and <a href="https://www.immigrantjustice.org/">the National Immigrant Justice Center</a> are fighting back in court.</li>
<li><strong>Vote accordingly</strong>. Don’t support politicians who stoke fear and ignore the Constitution. Know where your candidates stand.</li>
<li><strong>Stay informed</strong>. Read trustworthy reporting. Don’t let fear-based headlines erase the humanity and rights of others.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Speak up. Stay loud. Stay human.</strong></p>
<p>Because if we lose due process and habeas corpus, we lose the entire rule of law.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following statements should not be controversial, but they sadly are. What would you add to this list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump lost the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 6th, 2021, was an insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress, not the President (and much less the President&amp;rsquo;s unelected adviser), holds the power of the purse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Judicial branch, and not the Executive branch, interprets the law and the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one, not even the President, is above the law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
