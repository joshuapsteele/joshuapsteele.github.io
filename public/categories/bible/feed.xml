      <title>Stay Woke! Ephesians 5:11-14</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With fascism on the rise in the United States of America and around the world, and with many so-called &amp;ldquo;Christians&amp;rdquo; gladly supporting the rise of the far-right and attributing it to the will of God, I was struck by these words from Ephesians 5 (which were assigned as one of the readings for Morning Prayer today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 5:11-14 (New Living Translation, NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11 Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.&lt;br&gt;
12 It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret.&lt;br&gt;
13 But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, 14 for the light makes everything visible.&lt;br&gt;
This is why it is said,&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With fascism on the rise in the United States of America and around the world, and with many so-called &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; gladly supporting the rise of the far-right and attributing it to the will of God, I was struck by these words from Ephesians 5 (which were assigned as one of the readings for Morning Prayer today).</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:11-14 (New Living Translation, NLT)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11 Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.<br>
12 It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret.<br>
13 But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, 14 for the light makes everything visible.<br>
This is why it is said,</p>
<p>“Awake, O sleeper,<br>
rise up from the dead,<br>
and Christ will give you light.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are these &ldquo;worthless deeds of evil&rdquo;? From the beginning of Ephesians 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3 Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God’s people.<br>
4 Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes—these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God.<br>
5 You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God.<br>
For a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No doubt those who support the rise of the far-right would claim that they are not guilty of these things, but that they are themselves exposing the &ldquo;unfruitful works of darkness&rdquo; committed by those on the godless left!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>Of course, left-leaning political parties and movements are not without their own faults. But I think that the far greater danger within the church is that the far-right promise of political power and influence (and retribution against perceived enemies) has caused many to abandon the gospel of Jesus Christ in favor of a false gospel that is more concerned with power than with love, mercy, and justice.</p>
<p>Greed is idolatry.</p>
<p>Let judgment begin with the household of God. And may God have mercy on us all.</p>

      <title>You Can&#39;t Follow Jesus and Hate Immigrants</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/you-cant-follow-jesus-and-hate-immigrants/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 16:19:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/you-cant-follow-jesus-and-hate-immigrants/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.</p>
<p>Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!</p>
<p>But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.</p>
<p>What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?</p>
<p>What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?</p>
<p>If you think that a given immigration policy or system is a mess and that X, Y, or Z should be done about it, what are your motivations? Are you concerned about the welfare of the immigrants themselves, many of whom are quite poor and powerless? Or are you acting out of fear and self-interest?</p>
<p>Some may object, saying that while Christians are called to love immigrants, we still need to protect our borders and uphold laws. And it’s true that immigration policy is complex, and nations have a responsibility to maintain order and security.</p>
<p>However, the question here isn’t about the specifics of policy but about the posture of our hearts. As followers of Jesus, our first responsibility is to love others—including immigrants—as those made in God’s image. Upholding laws and protecting our country should never justify fear, hatred, or dehumanization.</p>
<p>Others may argue that showing hospitality to immigrants and refugees could lead to an unsustainable burden on our resources or change our cultural identity. While practical concerns about resources are valid, Scripture repeatedly calls us to care for the vulnerable, trusting that God will provide.</p>
<p>Moreover, the kingdom of God is not confined by national or cultural boundaries! As citizens of this kingdom, our identity should first and foremost be shaped by our faith, not by our nationality.</p>
<p>The Bible actually has quite a bit to say about immigrants, sojourners, and refugees. In fact, you can even read the entire storyline of Scripture through these lenses. Here’s the tiniest of tastes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God.<br>
(Leviticus 19:33–34, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow.<br>
(Deuteronomy 27:19, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was a stranger and you invited me in…<br>
(Matthew 25:35, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.<br>
(Hebrews 13:14, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.<br>
(Hebrews 13:2, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As M. Daniel Carroll Rodas explains in <a href="/files/Carroll_Immigration_DictionaryOfScriptureAndEthics.pdf">a helpful article on “Aliens, Immigration, and Refugees”</a> (click that link for a PDF of the article):</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the Old and New Testaments offer rich teachings on migration, emphasizing that refugees and immigrants are made in the image of God.</li>
<li>Many biblical figures, like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus himself, were displaced persons.</li>
<li>Old Testament laws protected the vulnerable, including immigrants.</li>
<li>Jesus’s teachings further challenge believers to see the outsider as someone who can lead them to a deeper faith.</li>
<li>The New Testament epistles also call the church to care for those on the margins, reminding Christians that they, too, are “strangers” in the world.</li>
<li>Biblical teachings on migration should shape how Christians act toward immigrants today, promoting “human flourishing and the common good” through both personal behavior and societal involvement</li>
</ul>

Daniel Carroll R., “Aliens, Immigration, and Refugees,” <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Dictionary+of+Scripture+and+Ethics&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=joshuapsteele-20&amp;linkId=fe86bbace8a5c59f7354c6bde6fc84eb&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</a></em>, Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2011, 58).</p>
<p>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.</p>
<p>Next time you’re reading the Bible, keep an eye out for terms like “alien,” “stranger,” “resident alien,” “foreigner,” and “sojourner.”</p>
<p>The next time you think or speak about immigrants, ask yourself: Do your words reflect the heart of Jesus or the harsh rhetoric of political discourse?</p>
<p>Consider how the kingdom of God cuts right across ethnic and national boundaries, reshaping our loyalties to all nations, tribes, etc.</p>
<p>As followers of Jesus, we are called to reflect His love and compassion in every area of our lives, including how we treat immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p>Take time to examine your heart and attitudes, and ask how you can embody Christ’s radical hospitality.</p>
<p>Engage with Scripture, seek out opportunities to welcome the stranger, and challenge rhetoric that dehumanizes or divides.</p>
<p>Let’s commit to being voices of love, grace, and justice in a world that so desperately needs them.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-peter-417&#34;&gt;1 Peter 4:17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;isaiah-58114&#34;&gt;Isaiah 58:1–14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shout out, do not hold back!&lt;br&gt;
Lift up your voice like a trumpet!&lt;br&gt;
Announce to my people their rebellion,&lt;br&gt;
to the house of Jacob their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet day after day they seek me&lt;br&gt;
and delight to know my ways,&lt;br&gt;
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness&lt;br&gt;
and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;&lt;br&gt;
they ask of me righteous judgments,&lt;br&gt;
they delight to draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="1-peter-417">1 Peter 4:17</h2>
<p>For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</p>
<h2 id="isaiah-58114">Isaiah 58:1–14</h2>
<p>Shout out, do not hold back!<br>
Lift up your voice like a trumpet!<br>
Announce to my people their rebellion,<br>
to the house of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p>Yet day after day they seek me<br>
and delight to know my ways,<br>
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness<br>
and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;<br>
they ask of me righteous judgments,<br>
they delight to draw near to God.</p>
<p>“Why do we fast, but you do not see?<br>
Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?”</p>
<p>Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day,<br>
and oppress all your workers.</p>
<p>Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight<br>
and to strike with a wicked fist.</p>
<p>Such fasting as you do today<br>
will not make your voice heard on high.</p>
<p>Is such the fast that I choose,<br>
a day to humble oneself?</p>
<p>Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush,<br>
and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?</p>
<p>Will you call this a fast,<br>
a day acceptable to the LORD?</p>
<p>Is not this the fast that I choose:<br>
to loose the bonds of injustice,<br>
to undo the thongs of the yoke,<br>
to let the oppressed go free,<br>
and to break every yoke?</p>
<p>Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,<br>
and bring the homeless poor into your house;<br>
when you see the naked, to cover them,<br>
and not to hide yourself from your own kin?</p>
<p>Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,<br>
and your healing shall spring up quickly;<br>
your vindicator shall go before you,<br>
the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.</p>
<p>Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;<br>
you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.</p>
<p>If you remove the yoke from among you,<br>
the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,<br>
if you offer your food to the hungry<br>
and satisfy the needs of the afflicted,<br>
then your light shall rise in the darkness<br>
and your gloom be like the noonday.</p>
<p>The LORD will guide you continually,<br>
and satisfy your needs in parched places,<br>
and make your bones strong;<br>
and you shall be like a watered garden,<br>
like a spring of water,<br>
whose waters never fail.</p>
<p>Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;<br>
you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;<br>
you shall be called the repairer of the breach,<br>
the restorer of streets to live in.</p>
<p>If you refrain from trampling the sabbath,<br>
from pursuing your own interests on my holy day;<br>
if you call the sabbath a delight<br>
and the holy day of the LORD honorable;<br>
if you honor it, not going your own ways,<br>
serving your own interests, or pursuing your own affairs;<br>
then you shall take delight in the LORD,<br>
and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth;<br>
I will feed you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob,<br>
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p>
<h2 id="ezekiel-34116">Ezekiel 34:1–16</h2>
<p>The word of the LORD came to me:</p>
<p>Mortal, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy, and say to them—to the shepherds:</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>
<p>Ah, you shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?</p>
<p>You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep.</p>
<p>You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them.</p>
<p>So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.</p>
<p>My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with no one to search or seek for them.</p>
<p>Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild animals, since there was no shepherd; and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep;</p>
<p>therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord GOD, I am against the shepherds; and I will demand my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer shall the shepherds feed themselves.</p>
<p>I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, so that they may not be food for them.</p>
<p>For thus says the Lord GOD:</p>
<p>I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep.</p>
<p>I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.</p>
<p>I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land.</p>
<p>I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.</p>
<p>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak,</p>
<p>but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: If you’re serious about biblical and theological studies, you should invest in Logos 10 Bible Software. &lt;a href=&#34;https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;amp;AFID=529204&#34;&gt;Do so via my exclusive partner offer for Logos 10 here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp;amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quit laughing at &lt;em&gt;How to Read a Book&lt;/em&gt; by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study computer science sooner rather than later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<hr>
<p>If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit laughing at <em>How to Read a Book</em> by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.</li>
<li>Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.</li>
<li>Study computer science sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when I finally became a Logos Bible Software customer in 2018 as a Ph.D. Student, Anglican Deacon, and Anglican website editor, it took my studies to the next level. I purchased a Logos 8 Anglican Silver package, <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/5758/barths-church-dogmatics">Karl Barth’s Church Dogmatics (31 Vols.)</a>, and <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/152651/dietrich-bonhoeffer-works-german-english">Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: German-English (34 Vols.)</a>, and I haven’t looked back since!</p>
<p>(NOTE: If you’re interested in the best FREE Bible and theology resources out there, then you NEED to check out <a href="https://bibleproject.com/">The Bible Project</a>, <a href="https://netbible.org/bible/Matthew+1#">The NET Bible</a>, and <a href="https://www.saet.ac.uk/index.php/articles">The St. Andrews Encyclopaedia of Theology</a>!)</p>
<h2 id="logos-10-worth-the-cost">Logos 10: Worth the Cost?</h2>
<p>Has it been a pricey investment over the years? To be sure.</p>
<p>However, even if I just consider the amount of <strong>time saved</strong> (1) looking things up and (2) citing works (which Logos handles AUTOMATICALLY when you copy and paste quotes!!!), I’ve come out on top</p>
<p>This is not to mention the breadth and depth that Logos Bible Software has added to my essays, sermons, emails (I used to receive a lot of Anglicanism-related questions!), and blog posts.</p>
<p>Now that Logos 10 is out, I can heartily continue to recommend Logos Bible Software. If you haven’t done so already, I strongly encourage you to consider buying (or upgrading to) Logos 10! (<a href="https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;AFID=529204">Again, you can do so via my exclusive partner link here!</a>)</p>

<h2 id="top-3-features-of-logos-10">Top 3 Features of Logos 10</h2>
<p>Real quick, here are my 3 favorite things about Logos 10 (compared to Logos 8 and 9).</p>
<h3 id="1-its-faster">1. It’s FASTER</h3>
<p>Right out of the box, you can tell that they’ve tweaked things under the hood to make Logos 10 run faster (noticeably faster on my 2016 MacBook Pro) than previous versions.</p>
<p>Especially when you’ve got a large library (I’ve got 3,975 items in my Logos library right now) and you’re using multiple resources at a time, running Logos Bible Software is computationally expensive. So I’m glad that the Logos team have made behind-the-scene improvements to the software that have yielded a noticeably superior user experience on my end!</p>
<h3 id="2-with-print-library-catalog-you-can-add-and-search-your-print-books">2. With Print Library Catalog, you can add and search your PRINT BOOKS</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/print-library-catalog">Print Library Catalog feature</a> is a game-changer, especially if you, like me, have quite a few physical biblical and theological books laying around!</p>
<p>If you add those physical books to your Logos Print Library Catalog, then, as long as Logos has digital versions of those books, you can use the power of Logos search to help you find things in your physical books!</p>
<p>This means that Logos Bible Software can now help you take better advantage of the physical books you already own! Genius.</p>

<p>As a student of historical theology, I’m a bit biased here, but I think that most Christians these days have a woefully inadequate understanding of Church history!</p>
<p>Granted, not everyone needs to become Church history experts! But all Christians should know at least the broad contours and the major themes from Church history. Let’s learn the most we can from saints who have gone before us!</p>
<p>Logos 10 makes a big step forward here with the new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/church-history">Church History Themes</a> feature. It’s a fantastic way to get up to speed on some of the most important movements and topics from the history of Christianity.</p>

<p>OK, we’re into the weeds a bit here, because I realize that not everyone will be interested in this. But, as someone who (attempted) a Ph.D. on two German-speaking theologians, let me just tell you that I REALLY wish this feature had been introduced earlier!</p>
<p>Logos 10’s new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/auto-translation">Auto Translation feature</a> makes it easier than ever to engage with works written in, say, Latin, French, or German right from Logos. I really hope that this kind of AI-assisted translation continues to improve, because there are so many works out there originally written in other languages. Plenty of these haven’t been translated into English yet. And, even when they have (looking at you, Barth’s Church Dogmatics), there’s really no replacement for engaging with a work in its original language.</p>

      <title>Are the Beatitudes “Renunciations” (Verzichte)?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/are-the-beatitudes-renunciations-verzichte/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:46:52 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Discipleship&lt;/em&gt; (DBWE 4), Dietrich Bonhoeffer frames all of the Beatitudes in terms of Jesus’ disciples living in &lt;em&gt;renunciation&lt;/em&gt; (Verzicht) and &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; (Mangel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, for Bonhoeffer, Jesus is only speaking to his disciples in the Beatitudes (he makes this argument on the basis of Luke 6:20ff.). And the disciples’ renunciation and want are &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; by Jesus’s call to discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus sees&lt;/em&gt;: his disciples are over there. They have visibly left the people to join him. He has called each individual one. They have given up everything in response to his call. Now they are living in renunciation and want; they are the poorest of the poor, the most tempted of the tempted, the hungriest of the hungry. They have only him. Yes, and with him they have nothing in the world, nothing at all, but everything, everything with God. (DBWE 4:101).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Discipleship</em> (DBWE 4), Dietrich Bonhoeffer frames all of the Beatitudes in terms of Jesus’ disciples living in <em>renunciation</em> (Verzicht) and <em>want</em> (Mangel).</p>
<p>Interestingly, for Bonhoeffer, Jesus is only speaking to his disciples in the Beatitudes (he makes this argument on the basis of Luke 6:20ff.). And the disciples’ renunciation and want are <em>caused</em> by Jesus’s call to discipleship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jesus sees</em>: his disciples are over there. They have visibly left the people to join him. He has called each individual one. They have given up everything in response to his call. Now they are living in renunciation and want; they are the poorest of the poor, the most tempted of the tempted, the hungriest of the hungry. They have only him. Yes, and with him they have nothing in the world, nothing at all, but everything, everything with God. (DBWE 4:101).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bonhoeffer also writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, “Blessed!” Jesus is speaking to the disciples (cf. Luke 6:20ff.). He is speaking to those who are already under the power of his call. That call has made them poor, tempted, and hungry. He calls them blessed, not because of their want or renunciation. Neither want nor renunciation are in themselves any reason to be called blessed. The only adequate reason is the call and the promise, for whose sake those following him live in want and renunciation. (DBWE 4:101).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Bonhoeffer is willing to frame all of the Beatitudes in terms of want and (especially) renunciation, he takes issue with August Tholuck’s distinction between some of the Beatitudes speaking of want “and others of the disciples’ intentional renunciation or special virtues” (DBWE 4:101; cf. Tholuck, <em>Commentary</em>, 64). Not, note, because Bonhoeffer has a problem with framing the Beatitudes in terms of renunciation and want, but rather because he thinks that “Objective want and personal renunciation have their joint basis in Christ’s call and promise” (DBWE 4:101–2).</p>
<p>In this connection, Bonhoeffer has a lengthy footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no basis in scripture for constructing a contrast between Matthew and Luke. Matthew is not interested in spiritualizing the original Beatitude (Luke’s form), nor is Luke interested in politicizing any original Beatitudes (Matthew’s form) referring only to “state of mind.” Need is not the basis of blessedness in Luke, nor is renunciation the basis in Matthew. Rather, in both, need or renunciation, spiritual or political matters are justified only by the call and promise of Jesus, who alone makes the Beatitudes into what they are, and who alone is the basis of calling those matters blessed. Catholic exegesis, starting with the letters of Clement, wanted to have the virtue of poverty declared blessed, thinking on the one hand of the paupertas voluntaria [voluntary poverty] of the monks, on the other hand of any voluntary poverty for Christ’s sake. In both cases the mistake in interpretation lies in seeking to make some human behavior the basis for blessedness, and not solely Jesus’ call and promise. (DBWE 4:102n2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for Bonhoeffer, Christ’s call is clearly central—not human behavior. And yet, Christ’s call seems to cause the human situations in view in the Beatitudes.</p>
<h2 id="heres-how-bonhoeffer-frames-the-beatitudes-in-terms-of-want-and-renunciation">Here’s how Bonhoeffer frames the Beatitudes in terms of “want” and “renunciation.”</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blessed are the poor in spirit -&gt; “those who live thoroughly in <em>renunciation and want</em> for Jesus’ sake” (DBWE 4:103).</li>
<li>Blessed are those who mourn -&gt; “those who are prepared to renounce and live without everything the world calls <em>happiness</em> and <em>peace</em>” (DBWE 4:103; cf. DBWE 1:184).</li>
<li>Blessed are the meek -&gt; those “who <em>renounce all rights of their own</em> for the sake of Jesus Christ” (DBWE 4:105).</li>
<li>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness -&gt; “Disciples live with not only renouncing their own rights, but even <em>renouncing their own righteousness</em>” (DBWE 4:105).</li>
<li>Blessed are the merciful -&gt; “these followers of Jesus live with him now also in the <em>renunciation of their own dignity</em>, for they are merciful” (DBWE 4:106).</li>
<li>Blessed are the pure in heart -&gt; “Those who <em>renounce their own good and evil</em>, their own heart, who are contrite and depend solely on Jesus” (DBWE 4:107).</li>
<li>Blessed are the peacemakers -&gt; those who “<em>renounce violence and strife</em>” (DBWE 4:108).</li>
<li>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake -&gt; “In judgment and action <strong>those who follow Jesus will be different from the world in renouncing property, happiness, rights, righteousness, honor, and violence.</strong> They will be offensive to the world. That is why the disciples will be persecuted for righteousness’ sake. Not recognition, but rejection, will be their reward from the world for their word and deed.” (DBWE 4:109, <strong>emphasis added</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>According to an editorial footnote, Eberhard Bethge’s notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>say that “everything is renunciation; nothing is Christian doctrine of virtue. Difference between ‘active and passive’ (making ethical distinction) is invalid” (22). As early as lectures of 1935 and 1935–36, Bonhoeffer sees the Beatitudes summarized in Matt. 5:10f. (DBWE 109n43).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, because I’m working on how Barth and Bonhoeffer read Genesis 1–3 and Matthew 5–7, I’m especially interested in the resonances between what Bonhoeffer has to say about the “pure in heart” renouncing their “good and evil.”</p>
<p>However, on a broader level, I’m curious where he got this thoroughgoing emphasis on “renunciation” (Verzicht) from.</p>

      <title>Are the Beatitudes “Good Works”? (Matt. 5:13–16)</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/are-the-beatitudes-good-works-matt-51316/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 19:13:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/are-the-beatitudes-good-works-matt-51316/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I wrote just a bit about &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/interpretive-approaches-to-the-beatitudes/&#34;&gt;interpretive approaches to the Beatitudes in Matthew 5&lt;/a&gt;. I’m trying to get a better handle on how Barth and Bonhoeffer treat the Sermon on the Mount, and I’m starting with the Beatitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the “standard” approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. A case in point: yesterday, I felt pretty confident that Bonhoeffer does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take the standard “entrance requirements” approach to the Beatitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I wrote just a bit about <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/interpretive-approaches-to-the-beatitudes/">interpretive approaches to the Beatitudes in Matthew 5</a>. I’m trying to get a better handle on how Barth and Bonhoeffer treat the Sermon on the Mount, and I’m starting with the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>However, it’s pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the “standard” approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. A case in point: yesterday, I felt pretty confident that Bonhoeffer does <em>not</em> take the standard “entrance requirements” approach to the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>After all, Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Jesus] calls them blessed, not because of their want or renunciation. Neither want nor renunciation are in themselves any reason to be called blessed. The only adequate reason is the call and the promise, for whose sake those following him live in want and renunciation.” (DBWE 4:101).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, complicating things just a bit, in his discussion of the “salt and light” passage in Matthew 5:13–16, Bonhoeffer seems to equate the Beatitudes with “good works”!</p>
<p>Here are the verses in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 “You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot.</p>
<p>14 “You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. 15 No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. (NRSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of his discussion of these verses, Bonhoeffer relates Christ’s cross to the visibility and “good works” of the disciples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The good works of the disciples should be seen in this light. “Not you, but your good works should be seen,” says Jesus. What are these good works which can be seen in this light? They can be no other works than those Jesus himself created in the disciples when he called them, when he made them the light of the world under his cross—poverty, being strangers, meekness, peacemaking, and finally being persecuted and rejected, and in all of them the one work: bearing the cross of Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the connection with the Beatitudes. Bonhoeffer continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cross is that strange light which shines there, by which alone all these good works of the disciples can be seen. Nowhere does it say that God becomes visible, but that the “good works” will be seen, and that the people will praise God for these works. The cross becomes visible, and the works of the cross become visible. The want and renunciation of the blessed become visible. But human beings can never be praised for the cross and for such a faith-community, only God can be praised. If the good works were all sorts of human virtues, then the disciples, not the Father, would be praised for them. As it is, there is nothing to praise in the disciple who bears the cross, or in the faith-community whose light so shines, which stands visibly on the mountain—only the Father in heaven can be praised for their “good works.” That is why they see the cross and the community of the cross, and have faith in God. There, then, shines the light of the resurrection. (DBWE 4:114).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>R.T. France agrees, noting the connection between these “good deeds” and the Beatitudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase “good deeds” conveys the qualities set out in the beatitudes, and especially the “righteousness” of life which is to be characteristic of disciples (cf. vv. 6, 10, 20); the phrase and the concept are echoed in 1 Pet 2:11–12. It is only as this distinctive lifestyle is visible to others that it can have its desired effect. But that effect is also now spelled out not as the improvement and enlightenment of society as such, but rather as the glorifying of God by those outside the disciple community. The subject of this discourse, and the aim of the discipleship which it promotes, is not so much the betterment of life on earth as the implementation of the reign of God. The goal of disciples’ witness is not that others emulate their way of life, or applaud their probity, but that they recognize the source of their distinctive lifestyle in “your Father in heaven.” (<em>The Gospel of Matthew</em>, NICNT, 177).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll admit that I’m used to taking Matthew 5:13–16 in a more mundane and less eschatological sense than Bonhoeffer. I’ve interpreted Jesus’ words as more along the lines of “mind your reputation in the eyes of outsiders” than “demonstrate good deeds that, because they are at cross-purposes with the world, won’t even be recognized as such other than eschatologically.”</p>
<p>After all, <em>when</em> will the outsiders glorify God? Now? Or, as it were, at the end of days? Here’s what 1 Peter 2:11–12 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beloved, I urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul. Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that, though they malign you as evildoers, they may see your honorable deeds and glorify God when he comes to judge (ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπισκοπῆς, “in [the] day of visitation”). (NRSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Bonhoeffer, France, and Barth are all right to draw our attention back to the eschatological character of the Sermon on the Mount. Yet, I have to agree with France when he explains “the eschatological character of the promises” in the Beatitudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A distinctive feature of these beatitudes (and of those of Luke 6:20–22) is that they not only list the qualities commended, but they also explain that commendation by a promise appropriate to each quality. The second half of each line is as important as, and indeed is the basis for, the first. All but the first and last are expressed as promises for the future, and the question is often raised whether that future is envisaged as fulfilled within the earthly sphere, or whether it looks to compensation beyond this life. The third beatitude, with its echo of Ps 37:11, raises the issue particularly acutely: “inherit the earth” (or perhaps “the land,” see below) sounds more concrete than a purely heavenly reward. So are these beatitudes speaking of benefits “now in this age” and not only “in the age to come”? That is the language Jesus uses in Mark 10:30, but we shall note that Matt 19:28–29 avoids such an explicit dichotomy, and is worded in such a way that it can be read as speaking only of heavenly reward. On the other hand, the present tense used in verses 3b and 10b, “it is to them that the kingdom of heaven belongs,” warns against a purely futuristic interpretation, and suggests that the simple dichotomy between “now” and “then” may miss the breadth of Matthew’s conception of the blessings of the kingdom of heaven. The kingdom of heaven has already arrived (4:17, and see on 3:2), and so these are people who are already under God’s beneficent rule. The advantages of being God’s people can then be expected to accrue already in this life, even though the full consummation of their blessedness remains for the future. The tension between “now” and “not yet,” so familiar from much of the rest of the NT, may appropriately be seen as running also through the promises of Matt 5:3–10. (The Gospel of Matthew, NICNT, 164).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even just the mixture of verbal tenses in the Beatitudes reminds me of <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/when-will-thy-kingdom-come-the-timing-and-agency-of-the-kingdom-of-god-in-the-lords-prayer/">the complex interplay between the “already” and the “not yet” when it comes to the Lord’s Prayer</a>.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I said in my previous post, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/interpretive-approaches-to-the-sermon-on-the-mount/&#34;&gt;Interpretive Approaches to the Sermon on the Mount&lt;/a&gt;,” I’m working on how Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer read the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Of course, when interpreting the Sermon on the Mount, the best place to start is at the beginning! This means beginning with the Beatitudes in Matthew 5:1–12.</p>
<h2 id="the-beatitudes-matt-5112">The Beatitudes (Matt. 5:1–12)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>1 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. 2 Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:</p>
<p>3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>4 “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</p>
<p>5 “Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.</p>
<p>6 “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.</p>
<p>7 “Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.</p>
<p>8 “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</p>
<p>9 “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.</p>
<p>10 “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>11 “Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. 12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. (Matt. 5:1–12, NRSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="heres-lukes-version-of-the-beatitudes-luke-62026">Here’s Luke’s version of the Beatitudes (Luke 6:20–26)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>20 Then he looked up at his disciples and said:</p>
<p>“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>21 “Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.</p>
<p>“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.</p>
<p>22 “Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. 23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.</p>
<p>24 “But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.</p>
<p>25 “Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.</p>
<p>“Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.</p>
<p>26 “Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets. (Luke 6:20–26, NRSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so-what-should-we-make-of-the-beatitudes">So, what should we make of the Beatitudes?</h2>
<p>Of course, the differences between Matthew’s and Luke’s versions of the Beatitudes have prompted considerable discussion within biblical studies.</p>
<p>As Jason C. Kuo notes in his “Beatitudes” article in <em>The Lexham Bible Dictionary</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some believe that only a few of the Beatitudes originate from Jesus Himself. Based on an examination of the background and the overlapping beatitudes between Matthew and Luke, Davies and Allison suggest that only three are original—“Jesus utters three paradoxical beatitudes: blessed are the poor, blessed are those who mourn, and blessed are those who hunger” (Davies and Allison, Matthew, 435). Others, however, suggest that at least eight of the nine can be traced to Jesus Himself. Hagner contends, “To assert that only three go back to Jesus assumes criteria that are too restrictive and presumes to know more than we can know” (Hagner, Matthew, 90). Blomberg suggests the possibility that “both Matthew and Luke might be excerpting from an original set of eight Beatitudes and eight woes” (Blomberg, Matthew, 98).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all due respect to these “Matthew vs. Luke” discussions, I’m much more interested in how people have gone about making sense of the Beatitudes in the context of the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5–7.</p>
<p>Again, here’s Kuo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A number of different approaches can be employed in interpreting the Beatitudes. They have been typically understood as primarily (1) pronouncing rewards for the virtuous, (2) signaling reversals for the unfortunate, or (3) combining elements of the two (Powell, “Matthew’s Beatitudes,” 460).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how Warren Carter summarizes the interpretive debates in his “Beatitudes” article in <em>Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has also been considerable debate about how to interpret Matthew’s beatitudes. Do they promise eschatological rewards for the virtuous who manifest these characteristics in their lives, or do they proclaim God’s reversals for those who find themselves in these unfortunate circumstances? Are the Beatitudes ethicized “entrance requirements” exhorting readers to a way of life by which they might enter God’s reign? Or are they “eschatological blessings” announced on those who already encounter God’s reign in part? Or is it possible to read them in one consistent way? To “mourn” in Matt. 5:4 does not necessarily seem to be a virtue, while to be a “peacemaker” is not a situation that needs reversing. (p. 159).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, that’s a really interesting observation to make regarding “mourn” and “peacemaker.” Are we perhaps trying to parse things out too finely if we try to make the Beatitudes fit into a single interpretive framework?</p>
<p>After all, I agree with Kuo that, regardless of which framework we go with, we need to remember to keep the focus on “the kingdom of God.” As Kuo puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the approach, the Beatitudes provide a framework for the people of God to understand what it means to be a part of the kingdom. Turner notes, “The theological purpose of the Sermon on the Mount in general and of the beatitudes in particular centers in the kingdom of heaven” (Turner, “Whom Does God Approve,” 36). In conjunction with the Sermon on the Mount, members of the kingdom are to be salt and light (Matt 5:13–16), providing an example as a “contrast community” (Bailey, “Model for Community,” 86) in the world. The Beatitudes—with their pronouncements of blessings as rewards and reversals—communicate a value system that is of the kingdom of God. Finally, as Davies and Allison conclude, the Beatitudes “bring consolation and comfort to Jesus’ heavy-laden followers … putting into perspective the difficulties of the present,” giving believers a “hope that makes powerlessness and suffering bearable” (Davies and Allison, Matthew, 467).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-about-barth-and-bonhoeffer">What about Barth and Bonhoeffer?</h2>
<p>For me, it’s still early days in trying to make sense of Barth and Bonhoeffer. Nevertheless, I’m comfortable with claiming that they both take a “synthetic” and “christological” approach to the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>“Synthetic” as in “not analytic.” As Merriam-Webster puts it: “attributing to a subject something determined by observation rather than analysis of the nature of the subject and not resulting in self-contradiction if negated.” (Compare/contrast “analytic,” as in: “being a proposition [as “no bachelor is married”] whose truth is evident from the meaning of the words it contains.”)</p>
<p>This is the language that Barth uses to describe the Beatitudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the sufferers of this world cannot pride themselves on the fact that their lives have this transparency, that the kingdom, Jesus, is in fact near to them. The declaration that they are blessed is a synthetic and not an analytic statement, referring to the objective thing that characterises their existence from above and not from below. To them, too, the new thing is said when they are called blessed in relation to their misery. Neither they nor their misery create the fact that they exist in that light of Jesus. It is simply the case, and they are called blessed simply because of that which is indicated by their misery: “The poor have the gospel preached to them” (Mt. 11:5). (CD IV/2, 191).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit later, Barth writes: “It is also clear that in so far as it entails suffering it is not an enviable situation. In this connexion, too, suffering is not joy. Again the beatitude is a synthetic and not an analytic statement.” (CD IV/2, 191).</p>
<p>So, for Barth, the Beatitudes are statements of self-evident truths. Instead, they are statements that are made true by the particular relationships between Jesus and the people in question.</p>
<p>Although Bonhoeffer doesn’t use the “synthetic vs. analytic” language, he seems to be saying much the same thing in <em>Discipleship</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, “Blessed!” Jesus is speaking to the disciples (cf. Luke 6:20ff.). He is speaking to those who are already under the power of his call. That call has made them poor, tempted, and hungry. He calls them blessed, not because of their want or renunciation. Neither want nor renunciation are in themselves any reason to be called blessed. The only adequate reason is the call and the promise, for whose sake those following him live in want and renunciation. The observation that some of the Beatitudes speak of want and others of the disciples’ intentional renunciation or special virtues has no special meaning. Objective want and personal renunciation have their joint basis in Christ’s call and promise. Neither of them has any value or claim in itself. (DBWE 4:101–2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things strike me as interesting about that paragraph. First, note how Bonhoeffer is willing to use Luke’s parallel to make a conclusion about whom Jesus is speaking to in the Beatitudes. I think I disagree with Bonhoeffer here, because, in Matthew, the Sermon on the Mount seems to be addressed to both the disciples and the crowds—the boundaries between the two groups being, in some sense, still up for grabs.</p>
<p>Second, in the penultimate sentence (“The observation that…”), as the editors note, Bonhoeffer is taking issue with Tholuck’s interpretation of the Beatitudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tholuck observes: “These eight beatitudes are arranged in an ethical order. The first four are of a negative character.… The three following … set forth what attributes of character are required in the members of that kingdom” (<em>Commentary</em>, 64). (DBWE 4:101n6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can hear the “entrance requirements for the kingdom” coming through loud and clear in Tholuck. To me, both Barth and Bonhoeffer push back against the “entrance requirements” view, without thereby committing them to a single interpretive framework at the expense of the others.</p>

<p>So far, the most exhaustive Sermon on the Mount “interpretive taxonomy” that I’ve found has been from Grant <a href="https://amzn.to/37oTuuA">Osborne’s <em>Matthew</em></a> (Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament; Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2010), 159.</p>
<p>Here are the approaches that Osborne lists, as summarized by Jason C. Kuo in his “Sermon on the Mount/Plain” article in <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/36564/lexham-bible-dictionary"><em>The Lexham Bible Dictionary</em></a> (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2016).</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>medieval</strong> approach—two levels of ethics with a higher set of standards for clergy and monastic members.</li>
<li><strong>Luther’s</strong> approach—the sermon discloses our depravity and brings us to repentance.</li>
<li>An <strong>Anabaptist</strong> approach—the sermon is a call to pacifism.</li>
<li>A <strong>liberal</strong> approach—the sermon is a paradigm for the social gospel.</li>
<li>An <strong>existentialist</strong> approach—the sermon is not absolute, but a challenge to personal decision.</li>
<li><strong>Schweitzer’s</strong> approach—the sermon is an “interim ethic” leading to a temporary set of codes to follow.</li>
<li>The <strong>dispensational</strong> approach—the sermon is limited in scope to the “future millennial kingdom” and applies only to the Jews, not to the church.</li>
<li>The “<strong>inaugurated eschatology</strong>” approach—believers should attempt to follow the commands, but full observance will only happen after Christ returns.</li>
<li>A <strong>wisdom</strong> teaching approach—Jesus was expressing His convictions using wisdom forms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, of course, the question is how best to situate Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s approaches!</p>
<h2 id="have-you-come-across-any-other-interpretive-frameworks-for-the-sermon-on-the-mount-that-you-would-add-to-this-paradigm">Have you come across any other interpretive frameworks for the Sermon on the Mount that you would add to this paradigm?</h2>
<p>Kuo notes D.A. Carson’s discussion (which can now be found in his Matthew commentary in <em>The Expositor’s Bible Commentary</em>, revised edition, volume 9, 155–57).</p>
<p>Carson notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attempt to understand the Sermon on the Mount within a unified theological grid has not produced consistent results. Schweizer lists seven major interpretive approaches; Harvey K. McArthur (<em>Understanding the Sermon on the Mount</em> [New York: Harper, 1960], 105–48) lists twelve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carson then proceeds to list:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. Lutheran orthodoxy (Osborne’s #2)</li>
<li>b. realized eschatology, moral road map (Osborne’s #4?)</li>
<li>c. “a set of moral standards used catechetically within Matthew’s community”</li>
<li>d. Anabaptist-Mennonite: applies to “all believers in every age and every circumstance” (cites Hauerwas’s Matthew commentary). (Osborne’s #3)</li>
<li>e. Existential: personal decision, authentic faith. (Osborne’s #5)</li>
<li>f. “Interim ethic” (Osborne’s #6)</li>
<li>g. Evangelicals and others, “interpret the Sermon on the Mount as an intensifying or radicalizing of the OT moral law” (cites Stott’s <em>Message of the Sermon on the Mount)</em></li>
<li>h. Classic dispensationalism: “law for millennial kingdom first offered by Jesus to the Jews.” Has faced numerous challenges, revised by J. Dwight Pentecost and John Walvoord. (Osborne’s #7?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Carson critiques all of these approaches as he goes along. He then briefly covers “several scholars [who] have narrowed the focus.”</p>
<p>What’s Carson’s view? He maintain’s that “[t]he unifying theme of the sermon is the kingdom of heaven.” The Sermon on the Mount</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“provides ethical guidelines for life in the kingdom, but does so within an explanation of the place of the contemporary setting within redemption history and Jesus’ relation to the OT (5:17–20). The community forming around him, his ‘disciples,’ is not yet so cohesive and committed a group that exhortations to ‘enter’ (7:13–14) are irrelevant. The glimpse of kingdom life (horizontally and vertically) in these chapters anticipates not only the love commandments (22:34–40) but also grace (5:3; 6:12; 7:7–11; cf. 21:28–46)” (157).</p>

&lt;p&gt;On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist.

Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#post-41871-footnote-2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By and large, I agree with these assessments.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>UPDATE: Here is the paper that I gave at the 2019 Karl Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at the Center for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church">INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”</h2>
<p>On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></sup> He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.</p>
<p>Of course, the very worst thing about supersessionism is that it implies that God is faithless and fickle. The next-worst thing about supersessionism is that it’s only a short step away from antisemitism and anti-Judaism. And yet, if Barth’s goal and our own is to interpret the book of Romans by ascertaining what Paul thought and spoke “in general and in detail,”<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup> then the worst thing about Barth’s somewhat supersessionist Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is not his equation of “Israel” with the “Church,” but rather his equation of “Gentiles” with the “world.” When it comes to Römerbrief chapter 10, there are actually good reasons for Barth to apply Romans 9:30–10:21 to the guilt of the Church, instead of Israel. However, glossing Paul’s “Gentiles” as the “world” makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pick up on Paul’s pastoral handling of the tensions between Jews and Gentiles within the Church. Paul is talking about the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians, whereas Barth is talking about the relationship between the Church and the world.</p>
<p>In order to make this point, I will first summarize Barth’s argument in Römerbrief 10, before assessing its strengths and weaknesses as an interpretation of Romans 10.</p>
<h2 id="summary-what-barth-is-doing-in-römerbrief-10">SUMMARY: WHAT BARTH IS DOING IN RÖMERBRIEF 10</h2>
<h3 id="the-krisis-of-knowledge-romans-930103-with-great-revelation-comes-great-culpabilitysup4post-41871-footnote-4sup">The KRISIS of Knowledge (Romans 9:30–10:3): With Great Revelation Comes Great Culpability<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></h3>
<p>The knowledge in question is the knowledge of God and the crisis is the judgment that humans are guilty. In fact, the crisis of knowledge is that both avoiding and pursuing the knowledge of God lead to guilt. <em>Avoiding</em> the knowledge of God <em>increases</em> the guilt and <em>pursuing</em> (and even receiving) the knowledge of God <em>reveals</em> the guilt. For Barth, the relationship between divine revelation and human plight is direct, not inverse.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>And yet, despite this direct correlation between revelation and plight, there is no escape from the judgment of God. There is no religiously privileged position from which the Church can judge Israel or the world. And there is no religion-<em>less</em> position from which the world can judge the Church. For Barth, as it is with Israel, so it is with the Church, and so it is with the entire world of ineluctably religious human beings.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Barth usually glosses “Israel” as the “Church” and “Gentiles” as the “world.” However, we should note that Barth is making an argument from the greater to the lesser when it comes to the relationship between Israel and the Church. He admits that the pinnacle of human religion, which is already the highest human possibility, is to be found in the history of Israel, asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can there be a ‘supreme’ religion, a highest pinnacle of all human work, in the relation between God and men? If such a religion were to be found anywhere, it would be in the ‘religion’ of the prophets and psalmists of Israel, which is nowhere excelled, certainly not in the history of Christianity, and not even in the so-called ‘Religion of Jesus’.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Barth is willing to mention Israel and Christianity in a differentiated manner. And yet Barth sees no religious evolutionary progress from Judaism to Christianity. The pinnacle of religion had already been reached in the history of Israel, before the history of the Church.</p>
<p>Now, of course, for Barth, to call something the “pinnacle of religion” is a particularly damning critique! And he immediate says that “a religion adequate to revelation and congruent to the righteousness of God, a law of righteousness, is unattainable,” except through the miracle of faith.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></sup> However, Barth is arguing that, if even Israel failed to attain the righteousness of God, then the Church will fare no better.</p>
<p>Although some might suggest that, given the direct correlation between revelation and plight, the best course of action would be to distance ourselves from the guilty Church, Barth maintains that there really is no escape from the solidarity of human beings under the judgment of God. He writes that “in the Church humanity becomes conscious of itself and is manifested as religious.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-8">[8]</a></sup></sup> Therefore, “in describing the Church we are describing ourselves.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-9">[9]</a></sup></sup> After all, Barth maintains that “in the affairs of God it is impossible for one individual to range itself against another, or one person against another. We cannot examine men, and then proceed to justify some and to condemn others.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-10">[10]</a></sup></sup> The knowledge of God, therefore, leads to a crisis, a judgment, a critique of ourselves and our best thoughts about God.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-11">[11]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3 id="and-yet-the-light-shines-in-the-darkness-romans-10421">And Yet, The Light Shines in the Darkness (Romans 10:4–21)</h3>
<p>Barth insists that, despite the Church’s tribulation and guilt, there is a way forward. But it is not pleasant. For Barth, “the hope of the Church” is manifest “precisely where its guilt is proven.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-12">[12]</a></sup></sup> The stone of stumbling, the rock of offense, is the only way forward. That is, in order to see the light of God that shines in the darkness, the Church must accept the judgment of God as her own, instead of trying to escape the judgment.</p>
<p>After all, on its own, the Church is desperately incapable. It is unable to have faith. It is unable to “do the law,” which, for Barth, means comprehending “that human righteousness comes into being only through the majesty of the nearness of God and of His election.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-13">[13]</a></sup></sup> The Church is unable to bring Christ near or to make Christ present. The Church can’t even negate its way to God!<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-14">[14]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Instead, the light shines in the darkness because God himself has already drawn near in Jesus Christ. Not, mind you, in a way that can be grasped and claimed by the Church as a possession. But, nevertheless, in an eschatological nearness that enables all human beings to call upon the Lord Jesus Christ and accept both the judgment and the salvation of God.</p>
<p>And yet, the light shines in “real darkness.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup></sup> Barth writes that “what is demanded of us here is that we should know that we are understood by God—in our lack of understanding.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-16">[16]</a></sup></sup> We best serve the Church by reminding it that even this demand exceeds its grasp. For Barth, we must not minimize but must instead emphasize “that the tribulation of the Church is its guilt, and that its guilt consists in a perpetual avoiding of the tribulation which it suffers from the secret of God.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-17">[17]</a></sup></sup> “The Church needs to be continually reminded of the most serious of all symptoms. It was the Church, not the world, which crucified Christ.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-18">[18]</a></sup></sup> Römerbrief chapter 10 was written as just such a reminder. With great revelation comes great culpability.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-what-should-we-make-of-barths-reading">ASSESSMENT: WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OF BARTH’S READING?</h2>
<p>So much for a summary sketch of chapter 10. Let’s now assess Barth’s argument.</p>
<h3 id="first-barth-was-right-to-critique-the-church">First, Barth Was Right to Critique the Church.</h3>
<p>Previously, in chapter 9, Barth wrote that “in contrast with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, there is thrust upon our attention—Israel, the Church, the world of religion as it appears in history, and, we hasten to add, Israel in its purest, truest, and most powerful aspect.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-19">[19]</a></sup></sup> The first time I read those words, I’m pretty sure my jaw hit the ground. And yet, I believe that Karl Barth was right to use Romans 9–11 to critique the Church instead of critiquing Israel. He was right, in other words, to interpret Paul’s words “to all God’s beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints” (Rom. 1:7) as an internal critique of the Church rather than an external critique of Israel.</p>
<p>And, as far as an internal critique of the Church goes, I believe that Barth gives some very good advice to the Church. Instead of grasping for a religiously privileged position that does not exist, Barth urges the Church to submit to the judgment of God. Like a good prophet, he calls the people of God to repent. Consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were the Church to appear before men as a Church under judgment; did it know of no other justification save that which is in judgment; did it believe in the stone of stumbling and rock of offence, instead of being offended and scandalized at it; then, with all its failings and offences—and certainly one day purified of some of them—it would be the Church of God.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-20">[20]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, this sounds like Paul, who, right after proclaiming that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes (Rom. 1:16–17), then proceeds to cut everyone down to size by reminding them that there’s no human path to the righteousness of God apart from submitting to the judgment of God (1:18–3:20). Humble repentance, not positivistic boasting, is the correct human response to God’s gracious salvation.</p>
<p>I largely agree with what Gaventa recently argued at the 2019 Karl Barth Conference.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-21">[21]</a></sup></sup> On the one hand, Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is dangerous, because it leaves the door open for supersessionism, and wrong, because it “violates the plain sense of the text.” Yet, on the other hand, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 flows naturally from his emphasis on human solidarity and the qualitative difference between God and humanity in his reading of Romans 1–8. Furthermore, Barth’s prophetic and pastoral indictment of Christian arrogance coheres with other aspects of Paul’s letter.<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-22">[22]</a></sup> As Gaventa pointed out, throughout the letter, Paul appears to draw lines between human groups, but he then proceeds to erase those lines.<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his critique of the guilty Church in Römerbrief 10, Barth is at least attempting to take the same posture as Paul. As a Jewish Christian writing to Christians in Rome, Paul took a posture of self-critique and solidarity with Israel. Barth therefore takes a posture of self-critique and solidarity with the Church.</p>
<h3 id="and-yet-barth-was-wrong-to-miss-the-jew-gentile-tensions-within-the-church">And Yet, Barth Was Wrong to Miss the Jew-Gentile Tensions WITHIN the Church.</h3>
<p>Exegetically speaking, using Romans 9:30–10:21 to critique the Church at least plausibly depends on Paul’s admission in the following chapter that he is speaking to “you Gentiles” as “an apostle to the Gentiles” (11:13). That is, the Gentiles among his predominantly Gentile Christian audience at Rome. At this point, we should recall that, in Romans 9:30–10:21, Paul is in the second stage of his argument that “It is not as though the word of God had failed” (9:6a). The first stage of his argument (9:6–29) was that “not all Israelites truly belong to Israel” (9:6b), “and not all of Abraham’s children are his true descendants” (9:7a). That is, membership in the people of God has always been determined by God’s gracious election—nothing else.</p>
<p>But what was the problem that necessitated this argument in the first place? Why, in other words, would anyone think that the word of God had failed? We get the answer in Romans 9:30–31: “Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith; but Israel, who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law, did not succeed in fulfilling that law.” I take Paul to be referring to the fact that, at that time, the Church was becoming more prominently Gentile, and that the message concerning Jesus as the Messiah was getting a better hearing, as it were, among Gentiles than among Jews.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-24">[24]</a></sup></sup> If the gospel were “the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek” (1:16), then why was it receiving such a relatively poor hearing among the Jews? Did this imply some kind of faithlessness on God’s part? Had his word to his chosen people failed (9:6)? Was God being unjust (9:14)? Had God rejected his people (11:1)?</p>
<p>Paul’s answer to these questions in Romans 9–11 is an emphatic “No!” He argues for continuity in the saving works of God, despite the apparent discontinuity in the response of Jews and Gentiles to Jesus the Messiah. This argument about God’s faithfulness, then, has implications for both Jewish and Gentile believers—a mixture reflected in the original audience of Paul’s letter.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Paul elegantly interweaves critiques of Jewish and Gentile Christians throughout his letter. Here, in Romans 9–11, after critiquing the majority of Israel for not pursuing the “law of righteousness. . . on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works” (9:31–32), Paul springs a rhetorical trap, as it were, and accuses Gentile Christians of being no better than Jews (11:11–32). These critiques play a role in laying the foundation for what Paul has to say in Romans 12–16, especially to the “strong” and the “weak” in chapters 14 and 15.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-25">[25]</a></sup></sup> The pastoral heart of the book of Romans is arguably Paul’s exhortation to Jewish and Gentile Christians to “welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God” (15:7).<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-26">[26]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>In Romans 9:30–10:21, then, Paul is critiquing Israel for failing to follow her Law to its <em>telos</em>, Jesus the Messiah. But he is doing so in order to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians within the Church. Barth therefore at least has room to consider what role Paul’s critique of Israel should play for a Christian audience. So, although he should have said more about Israel, perhaps focusing on the Church in Römerbrief 10 was justified.</p>
<p>However, when Barth equates “Gentiles” with “the world” in Romans 9–11, he is sawing-off the exegetical branch he is sitting on. Paul’s critique of Gentile Christians vis-a-vis Israel in chapter 11 is the most immediate exegetical justification for applying the critique of Israel in chapters 9 and 10 to the Church. But, according to Barth, the “Gentiles” are “those outside” the Church. Commenting on Romans 9:30 (“What then are we to say? Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith”), Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KRISIS appears here first. We have to recognize that, side by side with those who have knowledge and who are saints and children of God, there exist ignorant and unholy men of the world. However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness. . . . How can it be that the Gentiles, when confronted with the Church, are, and remain, Gentiles?<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-27">[27]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Barth’s theological conclusions about the relationship between the Church and the world might be legitimate. But the fact remains that this is almost completely the opposite of what was most likely in the background to Romans 9:30–10:21. It was the Church’s relative success among the Gentiles and relative failure among the Jews that Paul had in mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Barth might be correct in his refusal to identify and quantify who is “in” and who is “out” when it comes to God’s gracious election. But, for Paul and his audience, “Jews,” “Gentiles,” the “strong,” the “weak,” and “doing the law” at least had concrete, visible ramifications. These things were not merely eschatological.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-28">[28]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>In his comments upon Romans 10:12–13 (“For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved’”), Barth writes: “But are these men within the Church, or outside it, or are they members of some Church of their own founding? The question is trivial.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-29">[29]</a></sup></sup> Why trivial? Because Barth maintains that these “faithful heathen” are an “eschatological quantity.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-30">[30]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>I disagree. Although Barth is absolutely correct to interpret Paul as arguing for (1) unity between Jews and Gentiles on the basis of (2) the judgment and the salvation of God, he is guilty of overlooking the fact that, for Paul and the Roman Christians, differences between Jews and Gentiles were still significant, even if they were not meant to be ultimate/final.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-31">[31]</a></sup></sup> Although Barth was right to use Romans 9–11 as an internal critique of the Church, the main problem with Barth’s reading of Romans 10 and Romans 9–11 is that, while Paul is speaking about Israel in order to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians, Barth is speaking about the Church’s relationship to the world.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-32">[32]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Borrowing Barth’s words from his preface to the English translation of Römerbrief, we might ask, after reading chapter 10 of the Romans commentary, “Did Paul think and speak in general and in detail in the manner in which [Barth has] interpreted him as thinking and speaking?” My answer would have to be “yes and no.” Yes, in general, but no in detail. Yes, in form, but no in content.</p>
<p>Yes, the internal critique of the Church is Paul’s. But, no, Paul was not primarily talking about the relationship between the Church and the world. He was primarily talking about the Church. Yes, Paul brought Jew and Gentile alike together under the judgment and the salvation of God. But, for Paul, the guilt of the Church was not its ignorance of its dialectical relationship with the world. Instead, for Paul, the Church is guilty primarily because of its internal divisions.</p>
<p>Is there a way to bring Paul and Barth together in Romans 9:30–10:21? I think and hope so. We might arrive at the same destination, with regards to the relationship between the Church and the world, but I think that, when reading Romans, we need to start with the divisions that exist within the Church. With great revelation comes great culpability. The Church cannot comprehend the nature of her division and divisiveness apart from her knowledge of God. “There is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all” (10:12). And yet the Church cannot afford to erase or forget the distinction between Jew and Greek from her own internal history.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-33">[33]</a></sup></sup> Within the Church, the light of Christian unity shines, but it shines in divided and divisive darkness.</p>

<p>In what follows, I will focus upon the second edition of Barth’s commentary. However, it is helpful to note that Barth made some structural changes in chapter ten between the first and second editions. In Römerbrief 1919, chapter 10 is titled “A Guilt,” and the section headings are: Clarifications (10:1–3); The Message (10:4–15); The Deaf Ears (10:16–21). Barth addresses Romans 9:30–33 in the final subsection, “The Stone of Stumbling,” in chapter 9, titled “A Plight” (Eine Not). <em>Der Römerbrief, Erste Fassung (1919)</em>, ed. Hermann Schmidt, GA II 16 (Zurich: Theologischer Verlag Zürich, 1985), 388–93; 394–426.</p>
<p>In Römerbrief 1922, Barth famously adds “the Church” into his chapter titles in 9–11. Chapter 10, “A Guilt,” becomes “The Guilt of the Church” (492–526). Furthermore, Barth moves Romans 9:30-33 into the beginning of chapter 10, combining them with 10:1–3 and calling the subsection, not “The Stone of Stumbling” or “Clarifications,” but rather “The KRISIS of Knowledge” (492–507). He also combines Romans 10:4–15 and 16–21 into a subsection titled, not “The Message” or “The Deaf Ears,” but “The Light in the Darkness” (507–26).</p>
<p>So, between the first and second editions, it seems that Barth is doubling-down on his application of Romans 9–11 to the Church (as seen in the chapter titles), while also attempting the follow the contours of Paul’s letter a bit better (by seeing a break at 9:30 rather than 10:1). Among others, Cranfield, Jewett, Moo, Schreiner, NA28 and the NRSV all see a break at 9:30. See C. E. B. Cranfield, <em>A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans</em>, ICC (New York: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004), 2:503; Robert Jewett, <em>Romans</em>, Hermeneia (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2007), 606; Douglas J.

<p>You’re in much greater danger in the Holy of Holies than in the casino or anywhere else. Or, to borrow one of Barth’s images, when the revelatory shell explodes, those closest to it bear the brunt of the impact. Barth writes that “the real basis for this suffering coincides with the suffering’s basis of knowledge” (der Realgrund dieser Not zusammenfällt mit ihrem Erkenntnisgrund). Furthermore, “if human beings did not know/recognize God, they would not be in the position to recognize their suffering as such” (Würde er [der Mensch] Gott nicht erkennen, er wäre gar nicht in der Lage, seine Not als solche zu erkennen) Römer II, 493.

<p>The quote continues: “The Church, however, which sings its triumphs and trims and popularizes and modernizes itself, in order to minister to and satisfy every need except the one!; the Church which, in spite of many exposures, is still satisfied with itself, and, like quicksilver, still seeks and finds its own level; such a Church can never succeed, be it never so zealous, never so active in ridding itself of its failings and blemishes. With or without offences, it can never be the Church of God, because it is ignorant of the meaning of repentance.” Barth, Romans II, 370. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-20">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaventa, “The Finality of the Gospel.” <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-21">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, as Gaventa noted, Barth perhaps took his cue from some of Paul’s “unsettling exegetical moves” in Romans 9–11, like Paul’s use of Deuteronomy 30 to refer to “Jesus” and the “word of faith,” instead of to the “commandment.” Or Paul’s use of Hosea to refer to the Gentiles, instead of to Israel. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-22">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, Paul plays on Jewish stereotypes of Gentiles in the second half of chapter 1, before springing a rhetorical trap in chapter 2! In chapter 4, Paul brings up Abraham as the father of both the uncircumcised and the circumcised. And in chapter 5, Paul puts Jew and Gentile together in Adam and in Christ. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-23">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was a problem for Paul, given the Jewish provenance of the “the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh” (1:1–3). For more on the background and ethnic composition of Paul’s audience, see Jewett, Romans, 55–59, 70–72. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-24">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This point stands even though I admit that “strong” and “weak” probably do not exactly coincide with “Gentile” and “Jewish,” respectively. See Jewett, Romans, 70–72. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-25">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that it is legitimate to see Jew-Gentile tensions in the background here, because of what Paul then immediately says: “For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the <strong>circumcised</strong> on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the <strong>patriarchs</strong>, and in order that the <strong>Gentiles</strong> might glorify God for his mercy” (15:8–9, emphasis added). <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-26">↑</a></p>

<li>
<p>Barth, Romans II, 363. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-27">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his comments upon Romans 10:4–5, Barth argues that both “the righteousness which proceeds from the faithfulness of God” (his rendering of ἡ…ἐκ πίστεως δικαιοσύνη, 10:6) and “the righteousness which proceeds from the law” are but two ways in which we encounter the one righteousness of God. “In the first case the righteousness of God is invisible (unanschaulicherweise), in the second it is visible (anschaulicherweise)” Romans II, 375; Römer II, 508. Nevertheless, in describing Paul’s quotation of Leviticus 18:5 (“Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that ‘the person who does these things will live by them,’” Rom. 10:5), Barth writes: “This is what Moses means. By using the Futurum aeternum, he cannot fail to make us understand that neither the promise nor the condition which is linked to it is direct and observable. Both are used to denote the possibility which is messianic and eschatological” Romans II, 376–77. To say nothing of all of the many interpretive issues involved here, the fact remains that, for the “strong” and the “weak” in Romans 14–15, “doing the law” almost assuredly involved anschaulicherweise matters such as what was on the table when Christians dined together. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-28">↑</a></p>

<p>Barth, Romans II, 384. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-30">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This oversight, I believe, explains why Barth only devotes only 24 pages to his discussion of Romans 14:1–15:13 (Römer II, 671–700; Romans II, 502–26). He claims that “Truth and Mercy hold together Jew and Gentile, Church and World” (<em>Romans II</em>, 526), but he misses the fact that, in both Romans 9–11 and 14–15, Paul is focusing on holding together Jew and Gentile within the Church. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-31">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be clear, Barth’s equation of “Israel” with “the Church” is also problematic. He should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel than he did. And this appears to be an error that he recognized and attempted to address. In his Shorter Commentary, Barth says much more about Israel than he did in Römerbrief. See <em>A Shorter Commentary on Romans</em> (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2012), 110–47. Nevertheless, even there, Barth views chapters 9–11 and, indeed, 9–16 as someone of a digression from the main theme of Romans. Regarding chapters 9–11, he writes that “we are dealing with a second, comparatively independent part of the Epistle” (110). He applies the same judgment to chapters 12–16. Barth claims that “[a]ll that needs saying about that work of salvation, about the life that has been promised in the Gospel to the man who is righteous through his faith, has been said in what precedes” (110). I strongly disagree with this, and I think that Barth’s own hermeneutical principles should have prevented him from seeing the second half of the letter as only incidental to its main theme! What if, instead, Romans 9–16 were seen as the main point—at least pastorally—of the letter? <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-32">↑</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m scheduled to give a paper on Karl Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 in <em>Der Römerbrief</em> at the <a href="#">2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium</a> at Princeton in August.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it’s a pleasure and a privilege to give a paper at the colloquium. However, in hindsight, I don’t know why I thought giving a paper on chapter 10 of Barth’s Römerbrief was a good idea!</p>
<p>Granted, I don’t have to solve all of the exegetical issues (of which there are many) in Romans 9:30–10:21. I just have to make some sense of what <em>Barth</em> thought about the passage.</p>
<p>But, it turns out (surprise, surprise), it’s difficult to make sense of what Barth thought about Romans 9–11!</p>
<h2 id="barth-on-romans-911-in-der-römerbrief">Barth on Romans 9–11 in <em>Der Römerbrief</em></h2>
<p>If you haven’t read Barth’s <em>Epistle to the Romans</em>, here are his chapter headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Ninth Chapter: The Tribulation of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9:1–5. Solidarity</li>
<li>9:6–13. The God of Jacob</li>
<li>9:14–29. The God of Esau</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Tenth Chapter: The Guilt of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9:30–10:4. The <em>KRISIS</em> of Knowledge</li>
<li>10:4–21. The Light in the Darkness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Eleventh Chapter: The Hope of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>11:1–10. The Oneness of God</li>
<li>11:11–24. A Word to Those Without</li>
<li>11:25–36. The Goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Barth then proceeds to lump all of Romans 12–15 into one chapter, “The Great Disturbance.” And Romans 14:1–15:13 is relegated to a 25-page subsection entitled “The <em>KRISIS</em> of Human Freedom and Detachment.”</p>
<p>Now, if you’ve read chapters 9–11 of St. Paul’s letter to the Romans, you might be wondering: “Where did Israel go?” Great question!</p>
<p>Barth makes the move from Israel to Church without slowing down. Commenting on Romans 9:1–5, after giving a summary of what he’s said about the gospel of Jesus Christ in Romans 1–8, Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now, in contrast with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, there is thrust upon our attention—Israel, the Church, the world of religion as it appears in history, and, we hasten to add, Israel in its purest, truest, and most powerful aspect. We are not here concerned with some debased from of religion, but with the ideal and perfect Church. (<em>Romans</em>, 332).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as someone who cut his teeth on the book of Romans in the wake of N.T. Wright, I’m pretty sure that my jaw hit the ground the first time I read that.</p>
<p>But perhaps I should have seen it coming! After all, earlier, commenting on “to the Jew first, and also to the Greek” in Romans 1:16–17, Barth wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no man who ought not to believe or who cannot believe. Neither <strong>the Jew</strong> nor <strong>the Greek</strong> is disenfranchised from the Gospel. . . . The Jew, the religious and ecclesiastical man, is, it is true, FIRST summoned to make the choice; this is because he stands quite normally on the frontier of this world and at the point were the line of intersection by the new dimensional plane (1:4) must be veritably seen (2:17–20; 3:1, 2; 9:4, 5; 10:14, 15). But the advantage of the Jew provides him with no precedence. The problem ‘Religion or Irreligion’—not to speak of the problem ‘Church or World’—is no longer a fundamental problem. (<em>Romans</em>, 40).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. So “the Jew” and “Israel” are both ciphers for “the religious and ecclesiastical man,” “the world of religion as it appears in history.”</p>
<h2 id="isnt-that-supersessionism">Isn’t that supersessionism?</h2>
<p>Without fail, Barth’s equation of “Israel” with “the Church,” built upon his apparent evacuation of “Jew” and “Israel” of all <em>Jewish</em> and <em>Israelite</em> content, raises the specter of “supersessionism,” the view that the Church supersedes, replaces, or supplants Israel.</p>
<p>After all, in a straightforward sense, Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist, because he literally replaces “Israel” with “Church” in his exposition!</p>
<h2 id="despite-this-its-become-increasingly-common-to-at-least-mitigate-the-accusation-of-supersessionism-against-barths-reading-of-romans-911">Despite this, it’s become increasingly common to at least mitigate the accusation of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11.</h2>
<p>Let me highlight a few of these defenses of Barth.</p>
<h3 id="katherine-sonderegger-that-jesus-christ-was-born-a-jew-karl-barths-doctrine-of-israel-pennsylvania-state-university-press-1992">Katherine Sonderegger, <em>That Jesus Christ Was Born A Jew: Karl Barth’s “Doctrine of Israel”</em> (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1992).</h3>
<p>In the chapter on <em>Der Römerbrief</em> in her examination of Barth’s doctrine of Israel, Sonderegger argues that Barth had a robust notion of solidarity between Israel and the Church, and that, thanks to his use of the figures of Prophet and Pharisee at least, “Barth does not discard history, empty it, or make it of no use or value” (42).</p>
<h3 id="r-kendall-soulen-karl-barth-and-the-future-of-the-god-of-israel-pro-ecclesia-6-no-4-1997-41328">R. Kendall Soulen, “Karl Barth and the Future of the God of Israel,” Pro Ecclesia 6, no. 4 (1997): 413–28.</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, Barth is perhaps guilty of at least a kind of supersessionism in his exposition of Romans 9:30–10:21 in Romans. Soulen has has provided a helpful diagnostic framework of three different kinds of supersessionism: economic, punitive, and structural.</p>
<p>In his own words,</p>
<ol>
<li>economic supersessionism “holds that from the beginning, God’s purpose for carnal Israel in the economy of salvation was destined to be fulfilled and completed by Christ’s coming, after which its place was to be taken by the church” (415).</li>
<li>Punitive supersessionism “holds that God has angrily abrogated the covenant with Israel because of Israel’s de facto rejection of the gospel” (416). And</li>
<li>structural supersessionism “refers to the fact that the classical model” (of the canon’s coherence, that is), “taken as a whole, tends to render the Hebrew Scriptures largely indecisive for shaping doctrinal conclusions about how God engages creation in universal and enduring ways” (417).</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Soulen interprets Barth as (1) repudiating punitive and structural supersessionism while (2) supporting and defending “economic supersessionism.”</p>
<h3 id="douglas-k-harink-barths-apocalyptic-exegesis-and-the-question-of-israel-in-römerbrief-chapters-9-11-toronto-journal-of-theology-25-no-1-2009-518">Douglas K. Harink, “Barth’s Apocalyptic Exegesis and the Question of Israel in Römerbrief, Chapters 9-11,” Toronto Journal of Theology 25, no. 1 (2009): 5–18.</h3>
<p>In his 2009 article, Douglas Harink argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 cannot be regarded as supersessionist, precisely because he rigorously subverts any historicist or heilsgeschichtlich readings of the relation between Israel and the Church. In this respect Barth’s dialectical reading follows Paul’s apocalyptic understanding of history, even though it must be corrected at points with a better reading of Paul” (5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Critiquing Barth, Harink writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In his “consistent eschatology” of the radical Aufhebung and Begründung of all things created, Barth yields to a temptation that always hovers on the edges of apocalyptic theology, perhaps even Paul’s apocalyptic theology: the temptation to see God’s apocalypse in Jesus Christ as dissolving all creaturely being in its delimited, differentiated character (including God’s creature-by-promise-and-election, Israel), rather than as destroying the powers that set creaturely beings at enmity with one another and in bondage to decay” (16).</p>

<p>Here is how Wesley Hill assessed Barth’s exegesis of Romans 9:1–5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is not to claim that Barth’s exegesis amounts to a repetition of Paul’s “original intention”; it is, rather, simply to suggest that Paul’s distinctions between Jew and Gentile, and unbelieving Israel and believers in Jesus, are destabilized and reconfigured in Rom 9-11 in such a way that Barth may be considered to be on Pauline ground when he presses and probes these various group descriptors—for example, “Jew,” “Israel,” “Gentile”— to see where and how they may expand to make room for fresh hermeneutical appropriation and application. A case may be made for seeing Barth’s exegesis, despite its weaknesses, as theologizing with, not against, Paul” (149).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this assessment, and also with Hill’s modification of Soulen’s charge of “economic supersessionism.” Barth is actually closer to <strong>structural</strong> supersessionism in the 1922 edition of his Romans commentary.</p>
<p>As Hill puts it, “Israel simply does not feature in any central way in Barth’s exposition of what by common consent is Paul’s most sustained, penetrating discussion of Israel’s role in God’s salvific purposes” (152n63). This sounds a lot like the “Israel-forgetfulness” that Soulen mentions in his description of structural supersessionism (“Karl Barth and Future of the God of Israel,” 417).</p>

<p>Susannah Ticciati suggests that Barth was right to put the Church in the place of “hardened Israel” in his <em>Römerbrief</em> reading of Romans 9–11. Yet, he was guilty of forgetting Israel, “eliding Jews and Judaism from discussion of the text.”</p>
<p>She writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“if the church today is going to understand itself as (part of) Israel, claiming the name Israel for itself (even if not exclusively), then it will not be long, or at least should not be long, before it recognises that it has itself become hardened Israel, no longer the marginal gathering around the apostles of Christ, but a well-established institution which cannot escape the kind of systemic corruption for which the prophets called Israel of old to account. This is one of the radical insights of Karl Barth’s Romans, in which Barth equates the Israel lamented by Paul in Romans 9 with ‘the Church’. I follow Barth in this insight here, but with the hindsight provided by the historical paradigm shifts summarised above, and therefore without eliding Jews and Judaism from discussion of the text, as Barth does in his commentary” (513).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her explanation (and justification) for Barth’s equation of the Church with unbelieving Israel, Ticciati writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Church is ranged with all other human possibilities (under the banner of ‘religion’) as that which God brings radically in question. To be sure, it is the canal where the living waters of revelation have previously flowed; but it is an empty canal which can neither compel nor constrain them. Thus ‘belief in Christ’, as a divine possibility, is not something the Church can lay claim to, either as such or by contrast with other human bodies. In Barth’s words (commenting on Rom 11.20): ‘But who is a believer? and who an unbeliever? Belief and unbelief are established only in God. For us they are unobservable, incomprehensible, and uncertain.’ ¶ It is only a small step to the recognition that the Church, as a mere human possibility – far from being the ‘us’ of Rom 9.24 – can only be hardened Israel” (515).</p>

<p>As it turns out, Beverly Gaventa just gave a talk on Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 at the 2019 Karl Barth Conference at Princeton.</p>
<p>Here’s her talk:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4-r_vUsvEc?start=65&feature=oembed" title="Beverly Gaventa | The 2019 Annual Karl Barth Conference - Lecture" width="750"></iframe>
<p>One of Gaventa’s central claims, then, is that “even with its serious flaws, Barth’s treatment of Romans 9-11 has a contribution to make to our understanding of Paul.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, then, Gaventa thinks that Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is <em>dangerous</em>, because it leaves the door open for supersessionism, and <em>wrong</em>, because it “violates the plain sense of the text.”</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Gaventa argues that Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flows naturally from his stance on human solidarity given the qualitative difference between God and humanity as explained in his reading of Romans 1–8.</li>
<li>Is a pastoral/prophetic indictment of Christian arrogance.</li>
<li>Coheres with other aspects of Paul’s letter.</li>
</ol>
<p>What “other aspects” does Barth’s reading cohere with? Gaventa highlights some of “Paul’s ‘unsettling’ exegetical moves” in Romans 9–11, such as his use of Deuteronomy 30 to speak, not of the “commandment,” but of “Jesus” and “the word of faith.” Or his use of Hosea to refer to the Gentiles, instead of Israel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she points out that, throughout the letter, Paul <em>appears</em> to draw lines between human groups, but he then proceeds to <em>erase</em> those lines.</p>
<p>For example, Paul plays on Jewish stereotypes of Gentiles in the second half of chapter 1, before springing a rhetorical trap in chapter 2! Gaventa also notes how Paul handles Abraham vis-a-vis the question of circumcision in chapter 4. Paul then puts everyone together in Adam and in Christ in chapter 5.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-the-biggest-problem-with-barths-reading-isnt-supersessionism">What if the biggest problem with Barth’s reading isn’t supersessionism?</h2>
<p>I think that Sonderegger, Soulen, Harink, Hill, Ticciati, and Gaventa are all on the right track. It’s too easy to accuse Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 in the <em>Romans</em> commentary of supersessionism <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a mistake for Barth not to consider the particularities of Israel. This was a mistake that he began to address in his readings of Romans 9–11 in his <em>Shorter Commentary</em> and in the <em>Church Dogmatics</em>. But, as Soulen points out (and as Ticciati also argues in her recent chapter on Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 in the <em>Dogmatics</em>), Barth never fully abandoned some form of supersessionism. For Barth, Israel and the Church always go together as two forms of the one people of God, but there’s an irreversible and, in some sense, asymmetric relationship between the two. The relationship between Israel and the Church moves from judgment to mercy, from hearing to believing, from passing to coming.</p>
<p>However (and here’s my contribution to this discussion), I don’t think that the (potential) supersessionism of reading “the Church” for “Israel” is the biggest problem with Barth’s <em>Römerbrief</em> reading of Romans 9–11.</p>
<h2 id="instead-i-think-the-biggest-problem-with-barths-reading-is-that-he-equated-the-gentiles-that-paul-mentions-in-romans-930-and-again-in-1111ff-with-the-world">Instead, I think the biggest problem with Barth’s reading is that he equated the “Gentiles” that Paul mentions in Romans 9:30 (and again in 11:11ff.) with the “world.”</h2>
<p>Barth thereby fails to recognize that Paul is speaking to/about Gentile <em>Christians</em>. He misses Paul’s pastoral focus on Jew-Gentile tensions <em>within</em> the Church, and instead focuses on the relationship between the Church and the world.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of the problematic equation of “Gentiles” in Romans 9–11 with the “world.” Commenting on Romans 9:30 (Τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν; ὅτι ἔθνη τὰ μὴ διώκοντα δικαιοσύνην κατέλαβεν δικαιοσύνην, δικαιοσύνην δὲ τὴν ἐκ πίστεως), Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KRISIS appears here first. We have to recognize that, side by side with those who have knowledge and who are saints and children of God, there exist ignorant and unholy men of the world. However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness” (363).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking this notion to its conclusion, Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet, suppose it be allowed and granted that there is also salus extra ecclesiam, that both Esau and Jacob can be elect, what becomes of the backbone of the Church, what confidence can it have in its own mission? Does the Roman Church, in advancing its own well – known claims, do more than protect the proper interests of every Church? What becomes of Israel’s following after righteousness, of its zeal for God, if it be granted that the goal has been reached by those ‘others’ who take no part in this zealous pursuit? Can the Church fail to recognize the reproach which is implicit in God’s undertaking to do, alongside of, and apart from, the Church, the work with which it has been entrusted, and which is the justification of its very existence? What attitude does the Church adopt to this reproach?” (365).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can leave the admittedly complicated question of <em>salus extra ecclesiam</em> aside for the moment. The main problem with Barth’s exegesis here is that this is precisely not what Paul is saying!</p>
<p>The “Gentiles” that have attained to the righteousness of faith are not some kind of “anonymous Christians” outside the Church. They are, instead, within the Church. When Paul writes in Romans 11:13 “Now I am speaking to you Gentiles,” he is not referring, as Barth claims, to the dialectical relationship between the Church and the world, but rather to the predominantly Gentile Christians in Rome!</p>
<p>In this respect, the main problem with Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 is that his use of these verses to critique the Church plausibly relies on Paul’s admission that he is speaking to “you Gentiles” in 11:13. That is, the Gentiles among his Christian audience at Rome. On this basis, Barth therefore at least has room to consider what role Paul’s critique of Israel in 9:30–10:21 should play for a Christian Gentile audience.</p>
<p>However, Barth’s equation of “Gentiles” with the “world” prevents me from being able to justify Barth’s exegesis in this way! He’s effectively sawing-off the exegetical branch on which he’s seated! The only way that his reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 as the guilt of the Church passes exegetical muster here is if he can appeal to Paul’s clarification to Gentile Christians in Romans 11 that they are no better than Israel.</p>
<p>Barth is focusing so much on the solidarity—the dialectical identity—of Israel and the Church that he is missing Paul’s focus on differentiation within the Church. While Paul’s argument in Romans 1:18–3:20 supports Barth’s insistence that no human group has soteriological superiority over any other, Paul is more nuanced in Romans 9–11. He is doing something different, not merely repeating what he said in 1:18–3:20.</p>
<p>Barth writes that “However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness” (363; German original reads: “Die Kirche, heiße sie wie sie wolle, hat neben sich die Heiden, die Fremden, die Nicht-Verstehenden, die Unbeteiligten, die der Gerechtigkeit nicht Nachjagenden”).</p>
<p>That might be true, but that’s not the Paul is referring to <em>ethne</em> in this passage. The Gentiles are Christians!</p>
<p>Now, Barth is absolutely correct to interpret Paul as arguing for (1) unity between Jews and Gentiles on the basis of (2) the judgment and the salvation of God. However, at least here in the <em>Romans</em> commentary, I believe that Barth is overlooking the fact that, for Paul and the Roman Christians, differences between Jews and Gentiles were still significant, even if they were not meant to be ultimate/final.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-miss-the-jew-gentile-tensions-within-the-church-you-miss-the-pastoral-point-of-romans">If you miss the Jew-Gentile tensions <em>within</em> the Church, you miss the (pastoral) point of Romans!</h2>
<p>I agree with the thrust of Scot McKnight’s argument, in his recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Romans-Backwards-Gospel-Empire/dp/1481308777"><em>Reading Romans Backward: A Gospel of Peace in the Midst of Empire</em></a>, that “Romans 12–16…reveals the pastoral context of Romans.”</p>
<p>(Here’s a webinar where Scot introduces his work.)</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/325227168?dnt=1&app_id=122963" title="Reading Romans Backwards Webinar Replay" width="750"></iframe>
<p>That’s why I think it’s so lamentable that Barth puts Romans 12:1–15:13 into a <em>single chapter</em> in the <em>Romans</em> commentary.</p>
<p>And the only thing that Barth can squeeze out of Romans 14–15 is self-critique—that we should read Romans against ourselves. That’s great, and it’s not foreign to Paul in Romans (as Gaventa points out), but it’s not exactly what Paul is up to in Romans 14–15!</p>
<p>Paul has very specific tensions in mind <em>within</em> the Christian community (communities) in Rome—tensions that had to do with Christians’ attitudes toward Jewish Law and traditions. And I think that McKnight is right to claim that Paul is speaking to the “strong” and the “weak” of Romans 14–15 throughout the entire letter!</p>
<p>Barth claims that “Truth and Mercy hold together Jew and Gentile, Church and World” (<em>Romans</em>, 526), but he misses the fact that, in both Romans 9–11 and 14–15, Paul is focusing on holding together Jew and Gentile <em>within</em> the Church!</p>
<p>The “strong” and the “weak” in Romans 14–15 were not necessarily “Gentiles” and “Jews” respectively. As Thielman notes, “the situation in mid first-century Rome was more complex than this simple division allows” (<em>Romans</em>, ZECNT, Zondervan, 2018, p. 629). Nevertheless, the identification of the “strong” and the “weak” almost undoubtedly had to do with Jewish customs, and not, as Barth seems to claim, merely with the extent to which one had grasped Pauline theology and the KRISIS of God.</p>
<h2 id="barth-seems-to-have-missed-the-pastoral-point-of-romans">Barth seems to have missed the pastoral point of Romans.</h2>
<p>Barth claimed, in the preface to Hoskyns’ English translation of Romans, that, “in writing this book, I set out neither to compose a free fantasia upon the theme of religion, nor to evolve a philosophy of it. My sole aim was to interpret Scripture” (ix).</p>
<p>It is unfair, therefore, to critique Barth’s exposition of Romans 9:30–10:21 in chapter ten of <em>Römerbrief</em> by simply claiming that Barth was intending to carry forward his theological critique of religion, and not interested in explaining what Paul had to say.</p>
<p>However, it is entirely fair to critique Barth’s work by holding him accountable to the text of Romans 9:30–10:21. He himself said so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proper criticism of my book can be concerned only with the interpretation of the text of the Epistle. . . . My book deals with one issue, and with one issue only. Did Paul think and speak in general and in detail in the manner in which I have interpreted him as thinking and speaking? Or did he think and speak altogether differently? The fourth and last request I have to make of my English speaking readers is therefore quite direct. Of my friendly readers I ask that they should take nothing and believe nothing from me which they are not of themselves persuaded stands within the meaning of what Paul wrote. Of my unfriendly readers I ask that they should not reject as an unreasonable opinion of my own what, in fact, Paul himself propounded. The purpose of this book neither was nor is to delight or to annoy its readers by setting out a New Theology. The purpose was and is to direct them to Holy Scripture, to the Epistle of Paul to the Romans, in order that, whether they be delighted or annoyed, whether they are ‘accepted’ or ‘rejected’, they may at least be brought face to face with the subject-matter of the Scriptures” (<em>Romans</em>, ix–x).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Especially when it comes to Barth’s equation of “Gentiles” in Romans 9–11 with the “world,” I do not think that Paul thought and spoke “in general and in detail” as Barth interpreted him.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-thy-kingdom-haswill-come">Introduction: “Thy Kingdom [Has/Will] Come”?</h2>
<p>Just how <em>eschatological</em> is the Lord’s Prayer (=LP; Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4), particularly in light of its second petition, “Your kingdom come” (ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου, Matt. 6:10a; Luke 11:2d)? In other words, when will God’s kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)? Furthermore, who brings the kingdom about? Humans? God? Or some combination of the two? Settling the question of eschatology involves both the timing and the agency, the <em>when</em> and the <em>who</em>, of the kingdom.</p>
<p>When it comes to the LP, the literature is vast.<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> To get a grasp on the positions involved, Luz provides the following framework: “[t]here are essentially three basic types of interpretations in various combinations”: (a) the “dogmatic,” (b) the “ethical,” and (c) the “eschatological.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> The dogmatic interpretation views the LP as a summary statement of the Christian message/faith. The ethical interpretation views the LP as a guide for Christian living. These two interpretations have often gone together in the history of the Church. However,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[t]o these by no means mutually exclusive interpretations there has been added since the history-of-religions school (c) the <em>eschatological</em> interpretation, which relates the individual petitions more or less consistently to the eschaton and interprets the Lord’s Prayer from the situation of Jesus’ eschatological proclamation without regard for its relevance.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without discounting the importance of “dogmatic” interpretations of the LP, the relationship between the ethical and eschatological interpretations will be the focus of this paper. At this point, it helps to notice that discussions about the LP have tended to resemble discussions about the kingdom of God more broadly.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>When it comes to the kingdom of God, the question of the kingdom’s timing, the <em>when</em> question, has tended to dominate recent discussions.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></sup> There are three main schools of thought: (1) “already,” (2) “not yet,” and (3) “already-not-yet.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup> Again, note the connection between <strong>when/timing</strong> and <strong>who/agency</strong> in what follows.</p>
<p>First, scholars in the tradition of Albrecht Ritschl and Adolf von Harnack have interpreted the second petition to mean something like “Thy kingdom has already come, let it grow among us.” Consider Ritschl’s interpretation of the second petition: “On the lips of [Jesus’] disciples, the petition that God’s dominion may come presupposes that in the full sense this dominion has already been set in motion by Christ precisely in their own circle.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></sup> This fits well with Ritschl’s definition of the kingdom of God as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the divinely ordained highest good of the community founded through God’s revelation in Christ; but it is the highest good only in the sense that it forms at the same time the ethical ideal for whose attainment the members of the community bind themselves to each other through a definite type of reciprocal action.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-8">[8]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Ritschl and his ilk, <strong>the kingdom of God has already arrived (when/timing)</strong>, because it is a largely invisible ethical ideal (what), brought about by God in the inner lives of <strong>human individuals as they participate in his ethical agenda (who/agency</strong>, how, and where), in order to reveal God’s love and the value of humans in their relationships with one another (why).<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-9">[9]</a></sup></sup> I will refer to this interpretation as the “already,” “ethical,” or “non-eschatological” view.</p>
<p>Second, and in reaction to the “already” view, scholars in the tradition of Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer have interpreted the second petition to mean something like “Thy kingdom has not yet come, let it arrive soon.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-10">[10]</a></sup></sup> For example, in his 1892 argument for the future, apocalyptic, and eschatological nature of the kingdom of God, Weiss himself argued that “[w]hat speaks more forcefully than all else” against an identification of the kingdom of God as already realized in Jesus’ disciples is “the fact that Jesus put in the mouths of his disciples . . . the words ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us be careful lest somehow or other we play down this fact and these words. The meaning is not “may thy Kingdom grow,” “may thy Kingdom be perfected,” but rather, “may thy Kingdom come.” For the disciples, the βασιλεία is not yet here, not even in its beginnings; therefore Jesus bids them: ζητεῖτε τὴν βασιλείαν (Luke 12:31). . . . We would import an opaque and confusing element into this unified and clearly unambiguous religious frame of mind were we to think somehow of a “coming in an ever higher degree” or of a growth or increase of the Kingdom. Just as there can be no different stages of its being . . . so likewise there are no stages of its coming. Either the βασιλεία is here, or it is not yet here. For the disciples and for the early church it is not yet here.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-11">[11]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Weiss and company, <strong>the kingdom has not yet arrived (when/timing)</strong>, because it is the visible apocalyptic and eschatological reign of God upon the earth (what and where), which will bring this age to a close (why). <strong>Only God can bring it about, and the best humans can do is to prepare themselves for its arrival (who/agency</strong> and how). I will refer to this as the “not yet” or “eschatological view.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-12">[12]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Third, scholars in the tradition of Joachim Jeremias, Werner Kümmel, George Ladd, and George Beasley-Murray have argued for some combination of present and future, non-eschatological and eschatological.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-13">[13]</a></sup></sup> Although the precise way in which the combination is achieved varies from scholar to scholar, an interpretation of the second petition along these lines yields the paraphrase: “Thy kingdom has already begun to arrive, let it arrive soon in its fullness.” These kinds of views are sometimes labeled “inaugurated eschatology,” as opposed to a “realized” eschatology (the “already” view) or a “futurist” eschatology (the “not yet” view). In addition to using this terminology, I will refer to this as the “already-not-yet” interpretation.</p>
<p>So, which is it? When Christians today pray “Your kingdom come” in the LP, does that mean that the kingdom is already here, that it is not yet here, or some combination of the two? Furthermore, do humans bring the kingdom about, does God, or some combination of the two? Again, note the connection between the <em>when</em> and the <em>who</em>, the timing and the agency, of the kingdom. Broadly speaking, to the extent that the kingdom has <em>already</em> arrived, <em>humans</em> participate in bringing about the kingdom. However, to the extent that the kingdom has <em>not yet</em> arrived, <em>God</em> brings about the kingdom.</p>
<p>It has become common either to argue that the LP is entirely eschatological, or that the first half of the prayer is more eschatological, while the second half is more ethical, focused on disciples’ daily needs.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-14">[14]</a></sup></sup> In this paper, I argue that, especially due to the noncompetitive view of divine and human agency in the first, third, and fifth petitions, the “already-not-yet” view does the best job of explaining the entire LP, with elements of the “already” and the “not yet” throughout the prayer.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Introduction_Thy_Kingdom_HasWi"></a>According to the LP, the kingdom of God, I argue, is eschatological, but not otherworldly. It has ethical implications, but it is not thereby a non-eschatological ethical ideal. By “noncompetitive agency,” I mean that <em>both</em> God <em>and</em> God’s people hallow God’s name, do God’s will, forgive debts, and, I argue, bring about God’s kingdom—even as God is given the clear priority in each of those actions.<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-16">[16]</a></sup> In order to support this argument, I will make a cumulative case by working through the LP petition by petition, critically examining arguments for the “already” and “not yet” interpretations.</p>

<p>However, before discussing the content of the LP in detail, I would like to briefly argue that the “already-not-yet” interpretation of the kingdom of God makes the best sense of (1) the “kingdom of God” content in the Gospels, (2) the content and context of the two versions of the LP (Matt. 6; Luke 11), and (3) the unity of the LP.</p>
<h3 id="a-idpost-41777-the_kingdom_of_god_in_the_gospathe-kingdom-of-god-in-the-gospels"><a id="post-41777-The_Kingdom_of_God_in_the_Gosp"></a>The Kingdom of God in the Gospels</h3>
<p>First, the “already-not-yet” position makes the best sense of the kingdom of God content in the Gospels. Due to the LP’s brevity, everyone has to appeal to evidence about the kingdom of God in the Gospels more generally. Although this paper is not the place for a comprehensive examination of the kingdom of God in the Gospels, I believe that an “already-not-yet” reading of the LP is supported but the fact that there are passages in the Gospels that seem to indicate that the kingdom is (1) present/already here, (2) imminent/coming, and (3) future/not yet here.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-17">[17]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Given this mixed bag of evidence regarding the kingdom’s timing, both the “already” and the “not yet” perspectives have to find some way to either ignore or reinterpret the passages used by the other side. Consider how Harnack ignored Jesus’ eschatological pronouncements by relegating them to his Jewish context, rather than his unique contributions to history. Responding to those who would claim that Jesus’ apocalyptic/eschatological pronouncements were primary and his ethical ones were secondary, Harnack wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this view I cannot concur. It is considered a perverse procedure in similar cases to judge eminent, epoch-making personalities first and foremost by what they share with their contemporaries, and on the other hand to put what is great and characteristic in them into the background. . . . There can be no doubt about the fact that the idea of the two kingdoms, of God and of the devil, and their conflicts, and of that last conflict at some future time when the devil, long since cast out of heaven, will be also defeated on earth, was an idea which Jesus simply shared with his contemporaries. He did not start it, but he grew up in it and he retained it. The other view, however, that the kingdom of God ‘cometh not with observation,’ that it is already here, was his own.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-18">[18]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Weiss claimed that, if Jesus had contradicted his contemporaries’ eschatological conceptions of the kingdom, he would have done so (and the evangelists would have highlighted it) much more explicitly.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-19">[19]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, he argued that the parables that seem to indicate that the kingdom is present (such as the parables of the seed growing secretly, tares, mustard seed, and leaven) are really about something else, such as “the fate of the proclaimed word.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-20">[20]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to both of these approaches, the “already-not-yet” reading does the best job of making sense of the entire body of evidence we have regarding the kingdom of God in the Gospels.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-21">[21]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-content-and-contexts-of-the-two-versions-of-the-lp">The Content and Contexts of the Two Versions of the LP</h3>
<p>Second, the “already-not-yet” position helps to make good sense of the content and contexts of the two versions of the LP (Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4), without having to play them against each other. It is intriguing to note the similarities in the differences between the Beatitudes and the LP in Matthew and Luke. Both sets of differences can be interpreted as Luke mitigating Matthew’s eschatological focus with his own emphasis on the ethical. As Houlden observes, the content of Luke’s LP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is probably best seen, as far as Luke’s intention goes, as diverging from Matthew in the more practical and ethical way in which it sees the life of the kingdom. In this, too, as in its pithiness, it is parallel to his treatment of the Beatitudes (6:20-22). Line 5 in particular seems to substitute a concern with daily bread for Matthew’s hope for the “bread of the kingdom”. . . ; just as his blessing (6:21) is for those who “hunger now” rather than Matthew’s “hunger and thirst for righteousness” (5:6) and for the poor (6:21) rather than the “poor in spirit” (Matt 5:3). We recall, too, the strongly realistic picture of the new order Jesus brings depicted in the Nazareth sermon in Luke 4:16-20. It is possible that in line 7 Luke edges the sense of “temptation” toward a notion of everyday testing of faith in various moral predicaments and away from the ultimate (eschatological) test that will precede the End and that Matthew presumably has in mind.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-22">[22]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="post-41777-The_Two_Versions_and_Contexts_"></a> And yet, even if it is legitimate to see Matthew’s LP as placing slightly more emphasis on the “not yet” than Luke’s LP, it is equally important to note the contexts of the two versions, which, I suggest, seem to push in the opposite directions. That is, while Matthew’s LP perhaps emphasizes the “not yet,” its placement in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount should militate against a strong divide between eschatology and ethics. And, while Luke’s LP perhaps emphasizes the “already,” its introduction as a distinctive communal prayer of Jesus’ disciples (vis-a-vis John’s, see Luke 11:1) should militate against a collapsing of the LP into an ethical ideal for individuals.<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Whereas a thoroughgoing “already” reading would have to find some way to account for the eschatological emphases in the content of Matthew’s LP and the context of Luke’s, and thoroughgoing “not yet” reading would have to find some way to account for the ethical emphases in the content of Luke’s LP and the context of Matthew’s, an “already-not-yet” reading is able to allow both the content and the contexts of the two versions of the LP to stand in helpful tension.</p>
<h3 id="the-unity-of-the-lp">The Unity of the LP</h3>
<p>Third, an “already-not-yet” reading makes the best sense of the unity of the LP. In both Matthew and Luke, there is a clear twofold structure, delineated by the shift from the second-person singular (Matt. 6:9–10; Luke 11:2) to the first-person plural (Matt. 6:11–13; Luke 11:3–4). At first glance, there appears to be a shift from the eschatological to the ethical, from God and the coming of his kingdom to the daily needs of God’s people. However, I will argue below that this oversimplifies things and that there is an interweaving of the “already” and the “not yet” throughout the prayer. I therefore believe that an “already-not-yet” reading of the prayer does the best job of securing the unity of the LP.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-24">[24]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h2 id="our-father-in-heaven-πάτερ-ἡμῶν-ὁ-ἐν-τοῖς-οὐρανοῖς-matt-69b-par-luke-112b">Our Father in heaven (Πάτερ ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς; Matt. 6:9b; par. Luke 11:2b)</h2>
<p>When it comes to the opening words of the LP, there has been a longstanding debate on just how innovative and unique Jesus’ address of God as “father” (Πάτερ) was. Jeremias argued for the underlying Aramaic <em>abba</em>, claiming that Jesus’ address of God as such was entirely unique in his context, transcending a Jewish view of God with one of childlike intimacy.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-25">[25]</a></sup></sup> As can be seen in Harnack’s well-known emphasis of “the fatherhood of God” as one of the pillars of Jesus’ kingdom proclamation, a non-eschatological reading of the LP emphasizes the distinctiveness of addressing God in such intimate terms.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-26">[26]</a></sup></sup> At first glance, then, the “already” reading seems to win out.</p>
<p>However, Jeremias’ arguments about <em>abba</em>/father have come under criticism in subsequent decades.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-27">[27]</a></sup></sup> It is now recognized that, although Jesus’ use of the Aramaic <em>abba</em> was perhaps distinctive, referring to God as father was not.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-28">[28]</a></sup></sup> Rather than overplaying the uniqueness of Jesus vis-a-vis his Jewish context, it seems far better to note the profound connections between “our father” and the narrative of the Hebrew Bible.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-29">[29]</a></sup></sup> I agree with Perrin, who argues (based on, among other passages, Jeremiah 3:18–19 and Exodus 4:22–23) that the language of God as father recalls the covenantal relationship between God and his people—a relationship that spans from Abraham to Moses through exodus, from David to Jesus through exile, and from Jesus to his followers through new exodus and return from exile.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-30">[30]</a></sup></sup> The covenantal resonances would also seem to suggest the importance of covenantal faithfulness on the part of those praying “our father,” and not just on God’s part alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the combination of Matthew’s “our father” with Luke’s introduction of the LP vis-a-vis John’s disciples (Luke 11:1) suggests a distinctive communal emphasis here. As mentioned above, this emphasis seems to militate against the “already” position’s tendency to collapse the kingdom of God into an ethical ideal for individuals. Nevertheless, I will argue below that this communal emphasis should shape our understanding of both God and his people hallowing God’s name and doing God’s will.</p>
<p>Finally, although the phrase “in heaven” (ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς) surely <em>at least</em> distinguishes between God and earthly fathers (see Matt. 23:9), the difference is already so sufficiently obvious that it most likely is doing more.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-31">[31]</a></sup></sup> At the very least, “in heaven” (6:9b), along with “on earth as in heaven” (ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς; 6:10c) does suggest a dualistic emphasis on otherworldly realms common in apocalyptic eschatology.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-32">[32]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Our_Father_in_heaven"></a></p>
<p>On balance, then, “our father in heaven,” despite an ethical reading’s emphasis on the fatherhood of God, seems to support the eschatological reading. Indeed, theologically-speaking, it is hard to imagine a petitionary prayer that does not have at least an eschatological component, given that a request is being made to God, presumably regarding something that is not already the case! However, the covenantal resonances in “our father” at least open to the door to a non-competitive account of divine and human agency in which covenantal faithfulness is the main concern.</p>
<h2 id="a-idpost-41777-your_kingdom_come_matt_6ayour-kingdom-come-matt-69c10-par-luke-112cd"><a id="post-41777-Your_Kingdom_Come_Matt_6"></a>Your Kingdom Come (Matt. 6:9c–10; par. Luke 11:2c–d)</h2>
<p>A core of my argument is that the petitions in the first half of the LP are mutually interpreting. That is, for both Matthew and Luke, for God’s kingdom to come means that his name is hallowed—by both God and God’s people. And, for Matthew, it means that God’s name is hallowed and his will is done on earth—by both God and God’s people—as both of those things are already done in heaven. The grammatical structure of the petitions seems to at least allow for—if not support—this reading. After all, the subject of the verbs ἁγιασθήτω, ἐλθέτω and γενηθήτω is not God (though he is being addressed), but rather God’s name, kingdom, and will.</p>
<p>Therefore, although “your kingdom come,” if read on its own, <em>might</em> be clearly eschatological, as interpreted by the other two positions, it is best read as an “already-not-yet” request involving both divine and human agency coming together in a noncompetitive way. It is not an either/or but a both/and. God’s name is hallowed and his will is done by both God and his people. Therefore, this noncompetitive agency should, I argue, extend to the second petition as well. God brings the kingdom, but his people participate in this process.</p>
<h2 id="a-idpost-41777-hallowed_be_your_nameahallowed-be-your-name-ἁγιασθήτω-τὸ-ὄνομά-σου-matt-69c-par-luke-112c"><a id="post-41777-Hallowed_be_your_name"></a>Hallowed be your name (ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου; Matt. 6:9c; par. Luke 11:2c)</h2>
<p>God’s “name” refers to his reputation, essence, and identity. It is already holy (Lev. 20:3; Ps. 30:4; Isa. 57:15; Ezek. 20:39; Amos 2:7). So ἁγιάζω here means not “to make holy,” but rather “to treat or reverence as holy,” distinct and set apart.<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-33">[33]</a></sup> But who treats God’s name as holy? God or God’s people? The aorist passive imperative ἁγιασθήτω at first suggests a punctiliar divine passive—God hallowing his own name at single future point in time. However, the regular use of aorist imperatives in prayers complicates the decision about timing.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-34">[34]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, regarding divine vs. human agency, there is OT evidence that points in both directions.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-35">[35]</a></sup></sup> As Nolland observes, “An eschatological orientation would connect with the thought of Ez. 36:23: ‘I [God] will sanctify my great name’. There the sanctification in view is exclusively an act of God.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-36">[36]</a></sup></sup> However, a non-eschatological reading can appeal to Isaiah 29:23, where Israel sanctifies God’s name, “and where, though God is clearly involved, it is people who are to honour God’s name in action and in praise.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-37">[37]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, as Luz notes, in Judaism “‘[h]allowing the name’ is a widespread expression that means obedience to God’s commandments. . . . For Jews its highest expression is martyrdom.”<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-38">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the brevity of the petition and the evidence available for both positions, a decision is difficult.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-39">[39]</a></sup></sup> However, I do not believe we have to make a choice.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-40">[40]</a></sup></sup> Rather, I interpret this petition as an “already-not-yet” request that both God and God’s people (including the one praying the prayer) would sanctify God’s name—God, by bringing his people back from exile, and God’s people, by doing God’s will in obedience to God’s commands.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-41">[41]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h2 id="your-kingdom-come-ἐλθέτω-ἡ-βασιλεία-σου-matt-610a-par-luke-112d">Your kingdom come (ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου; Matt. 6:10a; par. Luke 11:2d)</h2>
<p>Here I agree with Luz’s assessment that “[w]ith the second petition of the Lord’s Prayer . . . the eschatological interpretation of the prayer has its strongest pillar.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-42">[42]</a></sup></sup> On a purely grammatical level, it is hard to refute Weiss’ claim that, if the disciples of Jesus are told to pray that the kingdom would come, that means that the kingdom is not yet here.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-43">[43]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Your_kingdom_come"></a></p>
<p>However, this is only the case if the second petition is interpreted on its own. We cannot ignore all the evidence in the Gospels that portrays the kingdom as having, in some sense, already arrived. Furthermore, as I am arguing, the first and the third petitions help to interpret the second. Therefore, although the future, final arrival of God’s kingdom is primarily in view here (otherwise we would not be praying for its coming), human participation in the hallowing of God’s name and the doing of God’s will in the present means that they are, in some sense, bringing about the kingdom’s arrival already, even if God is surely given priority in agency.</p>
<h2 id="your-will-be-done-γενηθήτω-τὸ-θέλημά-σου-matt-610b">Your will be done (γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου; Matt. 6:10b)</h2>
<p>Regardless of one’s stance on the precise historical relationship between Matthew’s and Luke’s versions of the LP, I argue that, on the basis of accepting Matthew as canonical Scripture, Christian interpreters ought not ignore the third petition when interpreting the second. I agree with C. Clifton Black, who argues that, “[w]hile it is conceptually possible to separate petitions for the coming kingdom (Luke 11:2c = Matt. 6:10a) and the fulfillment of God’s will (Matt. 6:10b), that is theologically ill-advised,” because there is considerable conceptual overlap between kingdom and God’s will.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-44">[44]</a></sup></sup> Jesus’ words in Matthew 7:21 are important in this connection: “‘Not everyone who says to me, “Lord, Lord,” will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.’” After all, a kingdom is the realm in which the will of the king is carried out.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-45">[45]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>But, much like with the first petition, the question arises: who does God’s will? God? Or God’s people? An eschatological interpretation of this petition claims the former, and a non-eschatological the latter. The answer, again, is surely both. I agree with Luz that Matthew 6:33 (ζητεῖτε δὲ πρῶτον τὴν βασιλείαν [τοῦ θεοῦ] καὶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ) “offers a clue to Matthew’s understanding [of the third petition] in that the evangelist adds ‘righteousness’ to ‘God’s kingdom,’ much in the same way he puts the third petition alongside the second. Strive for the kingdom by doing the righteousness appropriate to it.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-46">[46]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Your_will_be_done"></a>We are also aided by Jesus’ verbatim repetition of γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου in 26:42. There, the sense of the prayer is that both Jesus and the Father might accomplish the Father’s will. Jesus is surely not praying that the Father would do whatever he wants to, without any corresponding implications for Jesus’ own actions. Here, I argue, the same noncompetitive relationship between divine and human agency is in view. The prayer is that both God himself and the person praying the prayer (and, most likely, other human beings as well) would accomplish God’s will.</p>
<h2 id="on-earth-as-it-is-in-heaven-ὡς-ἐν-οὐρανῷ-καὶ-ἐπὶ-γῆς-matt-610c">On earth as it is in heaven (ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς; Matt. 6:10c)</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, both “in heaven” (6:9b) and “on earth as it is in heaven” (6:10c) perhaps suggest the kind of dualistic/otherworldly thinking found in apocalyptic eschatology. However, just as I have argued that the first three petitions of the LP are mutually interpreting, I also argue that this clause should be taken to apply to all three petitions, and not merely to the third. It is perhaps better to translate the clause more literally than the NRSV: “as in heaven, [so] also on earth.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-47">[47]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-On_earth_as_it_is_in_heaven"></a>The clause seems to imply that God’s will is already done in heaven, and at least not yet fully done on earth. Given the conceptual overlap between (1) the hallowing of God’s name, (2) God’s kingdom/rule, and (3) the doing of God’s will, I argue that God’s name is hallowed and his kingdom/rule is already present and recognized in heaven, and at least not yet fully so on earth. This is the “not yet” aspect of both the clause in question and the first half of the LP. However, because humans participate in the hallowing of God’s name and the doing of God’s will on earth, there is also an “already” aspect to both this clause and the entire first half of the LP.</p>
<h2 id="give-us-this-day-our-daily-bread-τὸν-ἄρτον-ἡμῶν-τὸν-ἐπιούσιον-δὸς-ἡμῖν-σήμερον-matt-611-par-luke-113">Give us this day our daily bread (τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον δὸς ἡμῖν σήμερον; Matt. 6:11; par. Luke 11:3)</h2>
<p>So far, I have argued, against those who claim that either the entire LP or its first half are eschatological, that an “already-not-yet” perspective makes better sense of the first half of the prayer, especially given the noncompetitive relationship between human and divine agency that seems to be in view in the first, third, and (I argue) second petitions. That is, I have been pushing back against the apparent upper hand of the “not yet” position in the first half of the LP.</p>
<p>As we turn to the second half of the LP, however, the “already” position seems to have the upper hand. After all, what could be more mundane and quotidian than the request for daily bread? However, the fourth petition is not nearly as straightforward as its traditional English translation implies. The contested etymology and meaning of ἐπιούσιον has bearing on whether the bread petition of the LP is eschatological or not. Traditionally, the word has been translated as “daily,” which supports a non-eschatological interpretation. However, the word is so rare in Greek that interpreters since Origen have long suspected it is a neologism.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-48">[48]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Depending on its etymology, ἐπιούσιον could mean (1) “necessary for existence,” (2) “for the current day, for today,” (3) “for the following day,” or (4) “coming,” in the sense of (a) “future,” (b) “coming/belonging to today”, (c) “next,” (d) “coming upon (us, from the Father),” or (e) “pertaining to the coming kingdom.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-49">[49]</a></sup></sup> A non-eschatological reading could rely on (1), (2), (3), (4b), (4c), or (4d). An eschatological reading could rely on (3), (4a), (4e), or a spiritualized interpretation of (1). Interpretation (3) seems to have the best lexical support, but this does not settle the eschatological question.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-50">[50]</a></sup></sup> “Give us this day our bread for the following day” could be “already,” referring to literal bread/sustenance for the immediate future, or “not yet,” referring to the coming messianic banquet.</p>
<p>On the one hand, even the staunchest advocates for the “not yet” interpretation of the fourth petition have to admit that literal, present bread is still in view. Consider Hagner, who, despite glossing the bread petition as “give to us today the eschatological bread that will be ours in the future,” admits that “[t]he prayer <em>is</em> nevertheless a prayer for bread. And there is a sense in which the bread (by synecdoche, ‘food’) we partake of daily is an anticipation of the eschatological banquet.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-51">[51]</a></sup></sup> On the other hand, given (1) the allusion here to the provision of manna in Exodus 16, (2) Jewish expectations of the return of manna in the final redemption,<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-52">[52]</a></sup></sup> and (3) the connections in the Gospels (esp. Luke) between Jesus’ table fellowship, the Last Supper, and the messianic banquet to come, the eschatological edge to this petition, even if indirect, should not be forgotten.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-53">[53]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Give_us_this_day_our_daily_bre"></a>On balance, the evidence seems to favor an “already-not-yet” interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="and-forgive-us-our-debts-as-we-also-have-forgiven-our-debtors-καὶ-ἄφες-ἡμῖν-τὰ-ὀφειλήματα-ἡμῶν-ὡς-καὶ-ἡμεῖς-ἀφήκαμεν-τοῖς-ὀφειλέταις-ἡμῶν-matt-612-par-luke-114a">And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors (καὶ ἄφες ἡμῖν τὰ ὀφειλήματα ἡμῶν, ὡς καὶ ἡμεῖς ἀφήκαμεν τοῖς ὀφειλέταις ἡμῶν; Matt. 6:12; par. Luke 11:4a)</h2>
<p>Yet again, the question of agency arises. Who forgives debts/sins?<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-54">[54]</a></sup> God or God’s people? However, whereas the first and third petitions were ambiguous, the fifth position is clear: both God and God’s people forgive. Without getting into the interesting questions about whether this petition implies that divine forgiveness is a <em>quid pro quo</em> for human forgiveness,<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-55">[55]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-And_forgive_us_our_debts_as_we"></a>I would merely like to note that the <em>reciprocity</em> of the forgiveness petition implies a noncompetitive view of divine and human agency. This noncompetitive agency—at least when it comes to the hallowing of God’s name, the doing of God’s will, and the forgiveness of debts—supports an “already-not-yet” interpretation of the LP and the kingdom of God. Although it does not settle the question of timing, it militates against the “not yet” view that, because we still await the final arrival of God’s kingdom, only God (and not human beings) participate in such an arrival. And, regarding the fifth petition specifically, the emphasis on the need for divine forgiveness of debts militates against the “already” view that the kingdom of God is an ethical ideal and the only salvation that is required is <em>epistemological</em>, the recognition that God is closer to us than we had previously thought.</p>
<h2 id="and-do-not-bring-us-to-the-time-of-trial-but-rescue-us-from-the-evil-one-καὶ-μὴ-εἰσενέγκῃς-ἡμᾶς-εἰς-πειρασμόν-ἀλλὰ-ῥῦσαι-ἡμᾶς-ἀπὸ-τοῦ-πονηροῦ-matt-613-par-luke-114b">And do not bring us to the time of trial, but rescue us from the evil one (καὶ μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν, ἀλλὰ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ; Matt. 6:13; par. Luke 11:4b)</h2>
<p>I argued above that the LP begins on an eschatological note with “our Father in heaven.” Does it end on an eschatological note as well? The answer depends upon just what πειρασμόν and τοῦ πονηροῦ mean. Although <em>peirasmos</em> has traditionally been translated as “temptation” (which in English connotes a temptation to sin or do wrong), the word in Greek can also mean testing or trial. The first thing that comes to mind is the <em>peirasmos</em> of Jesus himself in the wilderness, where perhaps both senses of the word are in play (Matt. 4:1–11). However, the question remains whether μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν has a specific, final temptation/trial in view (the “not yet” reading), or the many temptations/trials faced by disciples on a daily basis (the “already” reading).</p>
<p>While it is possible that, as Perrin argues, μὴ plus the aorist imperative εἰσενέγκῃς implies a specific πειρασμόν, even though it lacks the article, the common use of the aorist imperative in prayers (mentioned above with regard to ἁγιασθήτω in 6:9c) should perhaps prevent us from drawing strong conclusions here.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-56">[56]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, even if a specific πειρασμόν is in view, it is debatable whether or not this term had a technical apocalyptic/eschatological meaning.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-57">[57]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>When the phrase εἰς πειρασμόν occurs elsewhere in the Gospels, it is in Jesus’ injunction(s) in the Gethsemane to his disciples to stay awake and pray that they would not enter εἰς πειρασμόν (Matt. 26:41; Mark 14:38; Luke 22:40; 22:46). There, as here in the LP, the prayer seems to be for faithful perseverance in spite of temptation/trial, and not just for the complete absence of temptation/trial. Although Perrin is right to note the eschatological dimensions of the cosmic battle taking place at this point in the Gospel narratives, I think that France is also right to note that the immediate danger/testing was also in view, and not merely a final trial.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-58">[58]</a></sup></sup> An “already-not-yet” interpretation of the LP allows for an inaugurated eschatological perspective in which disciples encounter temptations/trials now that are foretastes/echoes of the final <em>peirasmos</em> to come.</p>
<p>As for the debate about whether τοῦ πονηροῦ refers to “evil” in general (neuter) or to “the evil one” (masculine), the evidence seems to slightly favor the latter interpretation. As France notes, Matthew’s use of the same term in 13:19 and 13:38 seems to clearly have “the evil one” in view. And the connection between πειρασμόν, and τοῦ πονηροῦ here seems to recall the temptation narrative in Matthew 4:1–11, where the devil is referred to as ὁ πειράζων (4:3).<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-59">[59]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-And_do_not_bring_us_to_the_tim"></a>Therefore, it seems legitimate to equate τοῦ πονηροῦ with “the devil” with “the tempter.”</p>
<p>There is, therefore, a clearly eschatological aspect to both the LP’s opening address and its final petitions. However, once again, an “already-not-yet” inaugurated eschatological interpretation, and not a futurist one, makes the best sense of the LP’s ending.</p>
<h2 id="a-idpost-41777-conclusion_the_lords_prayers_aaconclusion-the-lps-answers-to-the-kingdom-questions"><a id="post-41777-Conclusion_The_Lords_Prayers_A"></a>Conclusion: The LP’s Answers to the “Kingdom Questions”</h2>
<p>While it has become common either to argue that the LP is entirely eschatological, or that the first half of the prayer is more eschatological and the second half is more ethical, I have argued that the “already-not-yet” view does the best job of explaining the entire LP, with elements of the “already” and the “not yet” throughout the prayer.</p>
<p>While “Our father in heaven” is, I admit, predominantly eschatological, it recalls the covenantal relationship—and the expectation of covenantal faithfulness—between God and God’s people. The first three petitions (“hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done”) are a mixture of the “already” and the “not yet.” Because both God and humans hallow God’s name and do God’s will, I argue that they both bring about the kingdom’s arrival in the present, even if God is surely given the priority in agency and the full arrival of the kingdom is still future. The fifth petition (“forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors”) makes the reciprocal, noncompetitive relationship explicit. Yet it also militates against collapsing the kingdom of God into a mere ethical ideal. The fourth (“give us this day our ἐπιούσιον bread”) and final petitions (“do not bring us to πειρασμόν, but rescue us from τοῦ πονηροῦ”) are also a mixture of the “already” and the “not yet,” although they clearly acknowledge that human beings need divine provision and protection in order to cooperate with God in the doing of his will.</p>
<p>Both God and God’s people hallow God’s name, do God’s will, forgive debts, and bring about God’s kingdom—even as God is given the clear priority in each of those actions. Put simply, God initiates the kingdom, but his people participate in it. To the degree that we lose sight of the fact that God, not humans, is the primary agent of the kingdom, we forget that it is <em>God’s</em> kingdom we are praying about in the second petition and the LP. However, to the extent that we ignore how we are called to participate in the kingdom even as we pray for its full arrival, we forget that it is God’s <em>kingdom</em>—and every kingdom has its subjects. According to the LP, the kingdom of God is eschatological, but not otherworldly. It has ethical implications, but it is not a non-eschatological ethical ideal.</p>

<p>This is a common and accurate enough framework to organize the discussion. However, I admit that more nuanced frameworks are possible. For example, Black summarizes Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz’s (<em>The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide</em> [trans.

<p>Of course, for Weiss and many of his theological descendants, this describes Jesus’ mistaken view of the kingdom of God. Jesus expected the kingdom to arrive either during his lifetime or very soon after his death, but, Weiss and others would argue, he was obviously wrong.

<li>
<p>The question of the precise relationship between the two versions of the LP in the Gospels (Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4) has long occupied biblical scholars. For a sense of the debate, see Betz, <em>The Sermon on the Mount</em> (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995), 370–86; Black, <em>The Lord’s Prayer</em>, 43–49; Luz, <em>Matthew 1–7</em>, 309–11. Without discounting the importance of this question, I will focus on the Matthean version of the LP in this paper, mainly because Matthew’s version is closer to the versions commonly prayed by Christians today. Nevertheless, Luke’s version of the LP, read within the context of Luke’s Gospel, also seems to support (1) a noncompetitive view of divine and human agency and, therefore, (2) the “already-not-yet” view of the kingdom of God. I will comment upon Luke’s version as necessary. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-15">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am merely trying to argue that, when it comes to these actions, the question of agency is not a zero-sum game. Just because God hallows his name, brings his kingdom, does his will, and forgives debts, that does not mean that human beings do not do so as well. This is therefore much less ambitious than the account of “non-competitive relations” between Creator and creatures in Kathryn Tanner, <em>Jesus, Humanity, and the Trinity: A Brief Systematic Theology</em> (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 2001), although I think that Tanner is on the right track. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-16">↑</a></p>

<p>Here I agree with N.T. Wright’s assessment that both the “already” and the “not yet” are “strongly present through the various strands of gospel tradition, and to excise one of them because we deem them incompatible is anachronistic criticism of the worst sort.

<p>Furthermore, as Gibson argues, the context of the LP in <em>both</em> Matthew and Luke suggests a focus on the disciples avoiding the apostasy of “this generation.” “An Eschatological Prayer?,” 99. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-23">↑</a></p>

<li>
<p>This is <em>contra</em> Milling, who claims that only an eschatological reading of the entire LP secures the unity of the prayer. He characterizes other, non-eschatological readings as “sacrific[ing] the unity of the Prayer, in an attempt to make a few individual clauses relevant and practical<a id="post-41777-The_Unity_of_the_Lords_Prayer"></a>” (“The Interpretation of the Lord’s Prayer in Terms of Future Eschatology,” 13). But I think this is an example of the pot calling the kettle black. Both the “already” and the “not yet” readings have to work hard to explain (away) at least a few lines of the LP in order to arrive at either a thoroughgoing ethical or eschatological interpretation. The “already-not-yet” position, however, is able to allow both elements of the LP to stand in unity-in-tension. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-24">↑</a></p>

However, I am more hesitant to make this connection, because I think there is a difference, revealed in the use of Hebrew prepositions, between Adam being created “in our <em>image</em>, according to our <em>likeness</em>” (בְּצַלְמֵ֖נוּ כִּדְמוּתֵ֑נוּ; Gen. 1:26) and Seth being “in [Adam’s] <em>likeness</em>, according to his <em>image</em>” (בִּדְמוּתֹ֖ו כְּצַלְמֹ֑ו; Gen. 5:3).

<p>France (<em>Matthew</em>, 252) and Luz (<em>Matthew 1–7</em>, 322) both argue that <em>peirasmos</em> did not have such a meaning, although Luz admits Rev. 3:10 (“Because you have kept my word of patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial [τῆς ὥρας τοῦ πειρασμοῦ] that is coming on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth”) as an exception. It seems like an important exception(!), though not definitive. As Hagner (<em>Matthew 1–13</em>, 151) notes, <em>peirasmos</em> has the definite article in Rev. 3:10. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-57">↑</a></p>

      <title>What are your &#34;must-own&#34; biblical and theological studies reference works?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It just happened again. I had to consult &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/3878/a-greek-english-lexicon-of-the-new-testament-and-other-early-christian-literature-3rd-ed&#34;&gt;“BDAG,” A Greek–English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (3rd ed.)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t own a copy, so every time I have to consult BDAG I think “I really should buy this.” But for the past decade or so, primarily because of BDAG’s cost ($150 on Logos, $130 used on Amazon, $165 new on Amazon) I’ve held off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I’m seeking to build my “must-have” personal reference library to sustain a ministry as a pastor theologian. So, I think I need to buy BDAG sometime soon. While I’m at it, I might as well get HALOT, the Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament… &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/5228/bdag-halot-bundle&#34;&gt;Logos sells them as a bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Might as well get the <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/37742/the-ivp-bible-dictionary-series">IVP Bible Dictionaries</a>, too. I own hard copies of Prophets and Jesus and the Gospels, but I could use NT Background, Paul and His Letters, Historical Books, Pentateuch, and Wisdom, Poetry and Writings…</p>
<p>How far does the list of “must-have” reference works go?</p>
<p>I’m currently a Ph.D. student in theology, but my project is integrative across the biblical-theological studies divide (Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible). So, I need to have both my Bible and my theology bases covered, both now as a Ph.D. student and in the future as a “pastor theologian.”</p>
<p>What reference works in biblical and theological studies are your “must-owns”?</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/nbfr.12440&#34;&gt;this article in New Blackfriars&lt;/a&gt;, and it looks helpful, especially in the context of Anglican debates about women’s ordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Geoffrey Turner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”</p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey Turner</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="types-of-priesthood-in-the-new-testament">Types of Priesthood in the New Testament</h2>
<ol>
<li>Aaronic, sacrificing priest (like Zechariah, Luke 1:5)</li>
<li>The risen Christ</li>
<li>Priesthood of all believers</li>
<li>Ordained presbyters/elders</li>
<li>Passing mention of pagan priests (Acts 14:13)</li>
</ol>
<p>Concluding paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point of this paper, however, is not to try to change our naming of the ordained; our practice has centuries of tradition behind it. The purpose is to ensure that we do not muddle these distinctive types of priesthood. And the recent practice of calling our ordained priests ‘ministerial priests’ is a recognition that their priesthood is distinct from that of Jesus Christ and distinct from that of the baptised. There is no basis in the NT for supposing that that presbyters share the high priesthood of Christ as it is described in Hebrews. On the contrary, that high priesthood has only two members: Melchizedek and Jesus, and only one of those is a historical person. Deciding who may become a presbyter/ministerial priest and on what basis must be decided on its own terms and not by merging it with some other form of priesthood. Muddling these is particularly unhelpful when discussing whether women can be ordained as presbyters/ministerial priests.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the question we’re considering this week in our doctoral seminar on biblical and theological integration. Two of us are theologians and the other four are bible scholars. Should be interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, for the rest of the semester, we’re reading at least selections from the following works. The goal is to learn from examples of biblical and theological integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To start off the semester the other day, we prayed this prayer of confession together as a class. The professor didn’t remember where the prayer was from, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/a-corporate-confession-of-faith-based-on-the-ten-commandments-and-the-sermon-on-the-mount/&#34;&gt;I tracked it down online. According to Justin Taylor, it was written by Bob Kauflin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy and righteous God, we confess that like Isaiah, we are a people of unclean lips. But it is not only unclean lips we possess. We are people with unclean hands and unclean hearts. We have broken your law times without number, and are guilty of pride, unbelief, self-centeredness and idolatry. Affect our hearts with the severity of our sin and the glory of your righteousness as we now acknowledge our sins in your holy presence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>Holy and righteous God, we confess that like Isaiah, we are a people of unclean lips. But it is not only unclean lips we possess. We are people with unclean hands and unclean hearts. We have broken your law times without number, and are guilty of pride, unbelief, self-centeredness and idolatry. Affect our hearts with the severity of our sin and the glory of your righteousness as we now acknowledge our sins in your holy presence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have had other gods before you.</strong></p>
<p>We have worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator.</p>
<p>We have sought satisfaction in this world’s pleasures rather than in You.</p>
<p>We have loved to praise our own glory more than yours.</p>
<p><strong>We have taken your name in vain.</strong></p>
<p>We have prayed religious prayers to impress others.</p>
<p>We have uttered your name countless times without reverence or love.</p>
<p>We have listened to others use your name in vain without grieving.</p>
<p><strong>We have murdered in our hearts.</strong></p>
<p>We have often destroyed our neighbor with our tongues.</p>
<p>We have been quick to uncharitably judge others.</p>
<p>We have considered revenge when we were sinned against.</p>
<p><strong>We have committed adultery with our eyes.</strong></p>
<p>We have loved temptation rather than fighting it.</p>
<p>We have lusted after unlawful and immoral pleasures.</p>
<p>We have justified our lusts by using the world as our standard.</p>
<p><strong>We have stolen what is not ours and coveted what belongs to others.</strong></p>
<p>Our lives overflow with discontent, ungratefulness, and envy.</p>
<p>We have complained in the midst of Your abundant provision.</p>
<p>We have sought to exalt ourselves through owning more.</p>
<p><strong>We have lied to you and to others.</strong></p>
<p>We have told distorted truths, half-truths, and untruths.</p>
<p>We have despised the truth to make ourselves look better.</p>
<p>Even in our confession, we look for ways to hide our guilt.</p>
<p><strong>O God, we have sinned against your mercy times without number. We are ashamed to lift up our faces before you, for our iniquities have gone over our heads. If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? How shall we answer you? We lay our hands on our mouths. We have no answer to your righteous wrath and just judgment.</strong></p>
<p>We have no answer. But God Himself has mercifully provided one for us.</p>
<p>“All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.” (Is. 53:6)</p>

      <title>Go to Sleep and Have Some Kids: What the Bible (Psalm 127) Says about Productivity</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/go-sleep-kids-bible-psalm-127-says-productivity/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 12:51:21 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-productivity-in-psalm-127&#34;&gt;Personal Productivity in Psalm 127&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the Psalm opens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;Unless the &lt;span class=&#34;small-caps&#34;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; builds the house,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1-breaks&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;the builders labor in vain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;Unless the &lt;span class=&#34;small-caps&#34;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; watches over the city,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1-breaks&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;the guards stand watch in vain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="personal-productivity-in-psalm-127">Personal Productivity in Psalm 127</h2>
<p>I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).</p>
<p>Here’s how the Psalm opens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Ps-127-1">Unless the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> builds the house,</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-1">the builders labor in vain.</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-1">Unless the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> watches over the city,</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-1">the guards stand watch in vain.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.</p>
<p>Not true! It doesn’t matter how hard you work. If the Lord is not behind it and in favor of it, you’ll be laboring in vain.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this Psalm doesn’t undo the Bible other admonitions to work diligently, lest you fall into poverty (see my post about <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/20110210proverbs-topical-study-poverty/">Poverty in the book of Proverbs</a>).</p>
<p>However, it does have implications for when we go to bed!</p>
<h2 id="go-to-sleep">Go to Sleep</h2>
<p>Verse 2 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Ps-127-2" id="en-NIV-16124">In vain you rise early</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-2">and stay up late,</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-2">toiling for food to eat—</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-2">for he grants sleep to those he loves.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, personal productivity advice these days has come around to recognizing the vital importance of sleep for your health.</p>
<p>However, I don’t know about you, but I often feel the nagging temptation that, if only I could squeeze a few extra hours out of the day, I could turn things around. To be perfectly honest, this is one of the reasons why I try to get up early (~5:00am) most mornings.</p>
<p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with getting up early in the morning. After all, Jesus himself did so, in order to pray (see Mark 1:35).</p>
<p>However, if you’re staying up late and getting up early in order to toil away because you think your work and success depends only on your efforts, then this Psalm encourages you to go to bed. Get some sleep. Learn to receive each day, along with exactly as much time as it contains, as a gift from God.</p>
<h2 id="have-some-kids">Have Some Kids</h2>
<p>The second part of the Psalm hits close to home as well! (See my previous post: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/3-confessions-expectant-father/">3 Confessions of an Expectant Father</a>.)</p>
<p>Verses 3-5 read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Ps-127-3" id="en-NIV-16125">Children are a heritage from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>,</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-3">offspring a reward from him.</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-4" id="en-NIV-16126">Like arrows in the hands of a warrior</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-4">are children born in one’s youth.</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-5" id="en-NIV-16127">Blessed is the man</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-5">whose quiver is full of them.</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-5">They will not be put to shame</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-5">when they contend with their opponents in court.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I don’t have space here to address the complicated issue of infertility or other things that get in the way of having children. Just know that these verses don’t negate the fact that God loves and draws near to people going through such things in their times of pain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these verses also teach an important truth: children are a blessing from God.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love kids. And, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/3-confessions-expectant-father/">as I’ve said in my previous post, I’m excited to be a dad</a>!</p>
<p>And yet, I think that I’m going to need this Psalm as a frequent reminder in the days and years ahead! Personal productivity advice has come around to the idea of sleep being important, but I don’t know if there’s broad consensus on children always being considered a blessing! If you ask many people, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-happiness-doctor/201709/does-having-children-make-us-happy">the jury is still out on whether or not having children makes you happier</a> – much less more productive!!</p>
<h2 id="reminders-of-our-finitude">Reminders of Our Finitude</h2>
<p>So, I think this Psalm is a countercultural reminder that both sleep and children are good gifts from God.</p>
<p>They are BOTH reminders that we are finite creatures who cannot accomplish everything (or even <em>anything</em> meaningful) on our own. Instead, even though we are called to make the best use of our time, we are to receive each day as a gift from God – recognizing that, without his constant provision and sustenance, we would perish.</p>
<p>So, take heart! Go to bed a little earlier tonight! Everything doesn’t depend on you.</p>

<p>Right? Even with helpful books out there like <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2DQ55nt">How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth</a></em> (that’s an affiliate link, by the way, meaning that I get a small commission at no cost to you if you end up buying the book), there are still so many potential questions to ask of any biblical text when we study it.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to keep questions of authorship, genre, meaning, application, etc. etc. straight when we study the Bible?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-solution-ask-these-3-questions-of-any-bible-passage-you-read-and-study">The Solution: Ask These 3 Questions of Any Bible Passage You Read and Study</h2>
<p>No, I didn’t come up with these on my own. To give credit where credit is due: I heard them at Beeson Divinity School from Dr. Allen Ross. Also, a quick web search leads to <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/an-interview-with-gerald-bray-what-questions-should-we-ask-of-a-biblical-text/">this 2009 interview of Dr. Gerald Bray</a> (also a Beeson professor!)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-what-does-this-passage-teach-us-about-god">1. What Does this Passage Teach Us About God?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Who is God?</li>
<li>What is God like?</li>
<li>What has God done?</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of your observations. You’ll add to this as we go along.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-what-does-this-passage-teach-us-about-us-human-beings">2. What Does this Passage Teach Us about Us Human Beings?</h2>
<p>As if the first question wasn’t broad enough, this question can feel overwhelmingly broad and vague. So, to add structure, here are two distinct things to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What were we meant to be? How were we supposed to live?</li>
<li>What has gone wrong? How has sin corrupted that original vision of what it means to be a human?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, sometimes a passage will emphasize one of these things more than the other, but you should usually be able to extrapolate and answer both questions, regardless of what kind of passage you’re looking at.</p>
<p>For example, if a particular passage is emphasizing the fact that people lie all the time (answering the “What has gone wrong?” question), then you can extrapolate and answer the “What were we meant to be?” question: We were meant to tell the truth!</p>
<p>Again, make a list of your answers to these questions. Add it to your previous list of observations about God.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-what-does-this-passage-teach-us-about-how-we-are-supposed-to-respond-to-god">3. What Does This Passage Teach Us About How We Are Supposed to Respond to God?</h2>
<p>OK, here’s where the rubber meets the road. But, again, this question can feel pretty vague/broad, so here are sub-questions to add structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>What has God done to address what has gone wrong?</li>
<li>What does God expect of us in light of this?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you should be able to use your answers to the first two questions to help you answer this third question.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, however, you’ll find that the passage itself doesn’t explicitly say much about this third question.</strong> In that case, it is legitimate to <strong>extrapolate</strong> based on the rest of the Bible.</p>
<p>That is, say your passage doesn’t mention Jesus, but Jesus is in fact how God has addressed the human problem in your passage (protip: this is VERY OFTEN the case!) It’s legitimate to think and take some notes about how God’s entire mission of redemption and salvation addressed the particular sin problem that your passage focuses on.</p>
<p><strong>Take care when doing so, however!</strong> This is why it’s so important to know the entirety of the Good Story of God as found in Scripture. The more familiar we become with the entire narrative, the easier it becomes to make sense of each particular passage!</p>

      <title>The Hermeneutical Implications of Scripture&#39;s Theological Location</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theological &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics&#34;&gt;hermeneutics&lt;/a&gt; – human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God – faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Theological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a> – human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God – faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?</p>
<p>In what follows, I propose that <strong>we can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture’s theological location regarding its subject matter – the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself.</strong></p>
<p>In the first section, I will argue that the Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture’s role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God’s people. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God’s people, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.</p>
<p>Once we clarify the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic.</p>
<p>In the second section, therefore, I maintain that, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads: the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. My approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. Nevertheless, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of <em>all</em> authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Finally, in the third section, I offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. This has, I believe, implications for how the contested and contentious fields of biblical theology and the theological interpretation of Scripture ought to relate to each other. Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.</p>

<h1 id="a-id1ascriptures-theological-location"><a id="1"></a>SCRIPTURE’S THEOLOGICAL LOCATION</h1>
<p>The admittedly diverse texts that make up the Old and New Testaments of Christian Scripture bear witness to a single unified narrative – a sequence of events with its own dramatic coherence and sense – of the triune God’s creation and redemption of the world.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Crucially, Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture’s authoritative role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God’s people.</p>
<p><em><strong>(Note: For a related account of Scripture, read my previous essay: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/on-scripture/">Scripture: What It Is and Why It Matters</a>.)</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="scriptures-subject-matter-the-story-to-which-it-bears-witness">Scripture’s Subject Matter: The Story to Which It Bears Witness</h2>
<p>What is the story to which Scripture bears witness? It is the story of the identity and acts of God.</p>
<h3 id="regarding-gods-identity-scripture-bears-witness-to-the-fact-that-god-is-triune">Regarding God’s <em>identity</em>, Scripture bears witness to the fact that God is triune.</h3>
<p>Granted, a common objection to the doctrine of the Trinity is the claim that it nowhere appears in the pages of Scripture. And indeed, despite the favorite trinitarian “proof-texts” in which Father, Son, and Spirit appear together, “no doctrine of the Trinity in the Nicene sense is present in [even] the New Testament.”<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>However, as Jenson persuasively argues, “the doctrine of the Trinity is indeed in Scripture, <em>if</em> one abandons modernity’s notion that statement in so many words as formulated is the only way that a doctrine can appear there.”<a href="#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Instead, the <em>narrative</em> of Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.”<a href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> These three <em>dramatis personae Dei</em>, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a <em>persona</em> in Israel’s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.”<a href="#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
<p>YHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the Father by virtue of Jesus’ address of him as such.<a href="#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The Son is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address, but also in light of passages such as Psalm 2, appropriated in Hebrews 1 to identify Jesus as the divine Son.<a href="#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Finally, the Spirit appears as a <em>persona</em> of the story, first in the Old Testament as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the New Testament as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church.<a href="#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
<p>To say the very least, the classical formulation of the Trinity did not arise from a scriptural vacuum. So much for Scripture’s witness to the triune <em>identity</em> of God.</p>
<h3 id="regarding-gods-acts-scripture-bears-witness-to-the-narrative-of-gods-creation-and-redemption-of-a-people-unto-perfect-fellowship-with-himself">Regarding God’s <em>acts</em>, Scripture bears witness to the narrative of God’s creation and redemption of a people unto perfect fellowship with himself.</h3>
<p>Admittedly, there are ways of improving upon the common “creation – fall – redemption – consummation” framework for summarizing the story or “theo-drama” to which Scripture bears witness.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> However, as long as it is emphasized that redemption includes Israel, Jesus, and the Church, I think that this four-part framework is sufficient for our purposes.</p>
<p>At creation, God extends the fellowship he has eternally enjoyed as Trinity outward to that which is not God, especially to human beings, his “image-bearers,” who were to extend his rule and reign throughout creation (Gen. 1-2). However, at the fall, humans reject both the Creator and their creaturely vocation, rupturing fellowship between God and humanity, between humanity and itself, and between humanity and the rest of creation (Gen. 3).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, God does not abandon creation to exile and decay, but rather redeems it. God calls Abraham and the nation of Israel back to unity with himself through covenant. He endeavors to pull them – and through them as a priestly nation, the world – back from the ruptured relationships into covenantal fellowship and oneness.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> However, the faithless Israelites repeatedly eschew the loving faithfulness of their God, leading to the exile of the nation.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>At the incarnation, the Trinity stretches through the Son to meet all humanity – as a Jewish man in the midst of Israel – in its state of partial exile, to fulfill the global mission of Israel.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> As God enters our midst as Jesus Christ, he pushes us to the side in our perverted attempts to secure our own existence. Without succumbing to sin’s siren call, he is fully affected by it, bringing sinful human nature into the life of God and thereby intensifying the divine reaction against it into an ultimate tension. The one ultimately worthy <em>to</em> exile is now also the one ultimately worthy <em>of</em> exile.</p>
<p>At the cross, the Trinity stretches to the utmost, as the Son of God, worthy to mete out the sentence of exile, instead goes into exile – into the far country of the grave – bearing the consequences of sin for the sake of humanity’s salvation.</p>
<p>At the death of Christ, the Trinity has stretched to its limit, and yet humanity is left in a state of partial exile as before. However, through the power of the Holy Spirit, the exiled Son of God is vindicated as the Savior of the world and brought back from the far country of death.</p>
<p>Through this movement of the Son into the utmost exile and back again, sin itself is offered up to destruction. And crucially, all humanity who is united to him by grace through faith – everyone who is therefore in Christ – gets caught up with the Son in his return to the eternal life and love of the Triune God.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<h2 id="scriptures-role-in-the-story-to-which-it-bears-witness">Scripture’s Role in the Story to Which It Bears Witness</h2>
<p>Having summarized the story to which Scripture bears witness, we now turn to Scripture’s authoritative role in the story. What authority does Scripture have in the story, and what function/role does it play? I will attempt to answer these questions by explaining the relationships between (1) Scripture and God, (2) Scripture and creation, and (3) Scripture and God’s people, the Church.</p>
<h3 id="scripture-and-god">Scripture and God</h3>
<p>With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. But what does it mean for Scripture to be inspired by God? I agree with Henry’s definition of inspiration as “a supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on divinely chosen agents in consequence of which their writings become trustworthy and authoritative.”<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> However, I would add that the writings are specifically trustworthy and authoritative toward the divine ends of revelation and redemption. That is, God inspires human authors to communicate his word to human audiences for the sake of fellowship and communion with them.</p>
<p>The authority of Scripture, then, rests in its divine provenance. As Webster rightly states, “Scripture is authoritative because it is instrumental in bringing the word of God to bear upon the thought and practices of the church.”<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> Or, as Vanhoozer summarizes it, “the Bible not only reports the word of God but is itself a form of the divine address.”<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> In this way, the triune God makes himself verbally present to his creatures through Holy Scripture. The Bible, therefore, plays an authoritative role in the story to which it bears witness, because it is God’s own witness to his own identity and acts.</p>
<h3 id="scripture-and-creation">Scripture and Creation</h3>
<p>With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. I will have more to say about this below (see “Theological Hermeneutics: Both Special and General”). For now, it is enough to note that it is impossible to take up a perspective completely outside of the story to which Scripture bears witness, for the story encompasses all created space and time, as well as their origins and ends. Though Scripture plays a distinct role in the story, as opposed to other created realities, whether trees or thermodynamics, it is inherently related to the rest of creation – especially to God’s people.</p>
<h3 id="scripture-and-gods-people">Scripture and God’s People</h3>
<p>The story of Scripture includes and is intertwined with the story of God’s people, beginning with the story of Israel, and then, through Jesus the Messiah, the culmination of Israel’s story, continuing into the story of the Church.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> For this reason, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.</p>
<p>While certain accounts of the canonization of Scripture make it sound like the Church (rather arbitrarily) selected certain texts and deemed them authoritative, theologically-speaking, it is the other way around. As Webster rightly maintains, “the process of canonization is properly to be understood, not as an act in which the church creates an authority for itself by determining a set of normative texts, but as an act of acknowledging antecedent authority imposed upon the church from without.”<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> In fact, although the Church undoubtedly had a role to play in the canonization of Scripture (just as human authors had a role to play in the writing of Scripture), Scripture, as God’s word, creates and sustains the Church.<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>I agree with Watson’s claim that Gadamer’s concept of <em>Wirkungsgeschichte</em> is theologically helpful in describing the relationship between Scripture and Church. The Church can be viewed as the <em>Wirkungsgeschichte</em> – the “effective-history” – of Scripture. The text of Scripture exerts initiatory agency on the Church, and the Church exerts responsive agency on Scripture.<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a> Of course, the Gadamerian concept on its own does not replace the necessary constant guidance of the interaction between Church and Scripture by the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, it can help to clarify how this interaction takes place.</p>
<p>In summary, Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. It is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. Furthermore, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And finally, Scripture is irreducibly ecclesiological.</p>
<h1 id="a-id2atheological-hermeneutics-special-and-general"><a id="2"></a>THEOLOGICAL HERMENEUTICS: SPECIAL AND GENERAL</h1>
<p>Having clarified the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic. To the first relationship we now turn. Properly understood, theological hermeneutics is both a special and a general hermeneutic.<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within the story of its subject matter, theological hermeneutics is a <em>special</em> hermeneutic. That is, we do not read Scripture exactly like any other book, because Scripture is unlike all other books to the extent that it is the inspired and authoritative word of the triune God, used to reveal himself and redeem his people unto fellowship with himself. Given the explicitly theological subject matter of Scripture, it is ill-advised to attempt to shoehorn Scripture into a general hermeneutic that is designed to work apart from a theological perspective. Although some may accuse such an explicitly theological approach as “special pleading,” I maintain that a special, theological hermeneutic of Scripture is necessary to interpret Scripture according to its subject matter.</p>
<p>Does this mean, then, that theological hermeneutics becomes a ghettoized discipline? Not necessarily. Because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, theological hermeneutics is also a <em>general</em>/universal hermeneutic. Indeed, it will only appear like a disciplinary ghetto to the extent that one has not yet been shaped by Scripture’s subject matter.</p>
<p>I am in agreement with Jenson’s claim that “we read the relation between the strange world the Bible opens and our familiar world the wrong way around, and so are in a hopeless situation from the start.”<a href="#_ftn22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> He continues: “When the Bible lacks force in the church,” (and, I would add, in the academy!), “it is regularly — from the time of the apostles to post-Christendom — because we presume that the ‘real’ world is some other world than the one that opens in the Bible, and that what we have to do is figure out how to make the Bible effective in the putatively ‘real’ world.” This is an ill-fated enterprise, for “the Bible is in fact ineffective and irrelevant in our so-called ‘real’ world, because the Bible does not acknowledge that our ‘real’ world deserves the adjective.”<a href="#_ftn23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>
<p>Because the story to which Scripture bears witness is the story of the real world, theological hermeneutics is a general and universal hermeneutic.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-the-hermeneutical-triads">Implications for the Hermeneutical Triads</h2>
<p>This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads, the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis.</p>
<p>My approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance, for they determine how we ought to interpret everything else, including historical and literary analysis, as well as all other authors, texts, and readers.</p>
<p>Does this mean, then, that theology <em>dominates</em> all other disciplines? Will we quickly find ourselves insisting upon a puritanical regulative principle as the standard of human knowledge, rejecting claims to knowledge of anything – whether physical quarks or human quirks – not mentioned in the pages of the Bible?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily. For, although I maintain that theology is, as it were, the queen of the sciences, she is a kindly ruler. That is, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of <em>all</em> authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, plenty of Scriptural teaching would seem to suggest that theological “insiders” must remain intellectually humble, open to the possibility that theological “outsiders,” whether methodological naturalists or adherents of other religions, might have much to teach them about the world.<a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> As Treier notes, “often non-Christian interpreters will understand – that is, develop various capacities for communicative action in relation to – texts far better than Christians will.”<a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> This takes nothing away from the authority or scope of Scripture or its subject matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, although some readers may object to the extent to which I am willing to give theology explicit priority over all other disciplines of human understanding, I would answer that doing so actually ends up requiring and resourcing other intellectual disciplines better (from a theological perspective, at least) than they could do so on their own.</p>
<p>In sum, then, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. What does this mean for the relationship between biblical and theological studies? Should they be one discipline or two (or more)?</p>
<h1 id="a-id3abiblical-and-theological-studies-a-multifaceted-discipline"><a id="3"></a>BIBLICAL AND THEOLOGICAL STUDIES: A MULTIFACETED DISCIPLINE</h1>
<p>Given the enormity and the importance of Scripture’s subject matter, I here offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.</p>
<h2 id="biblical-and-theological-studies-need-each-other">Biblical and Theological Studies Need Each Other</h2>
<p>Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. In many churchly circles, this assertion would not be met with much resistance. However, in the (modern) academy, biblical and theological studies have been kept increasingly separate. Since the academy is the sphere in which biblical and(/or) theological studies is/are located as (an) academic discipline/s (see how confusing this gets?), we must reckon with the academic division.</p>
<p>In their survey of the “original unity and subsequent separation” of biblical studies and systematic theology, Rowe and Hays helpfully observe that the separation of the two disciplines is a relatively recent phenomenon.<a href="#_ftn26">[26]</a> Indeed, they (approximately) trace the modern division to the eighteenth century, paradigmatically to J.P. Gabler’s 1787 inaugural address regarding the distinction between biblical and dogmatic theology.<a href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> Broadly speaking, in Gabler’s wake, biblical and theological studies have, at worst, ignored each other’s contributions entirely and, at best, functioned as a sort of disciplinary layer-cake, with the results of each discipline being transmitted to the other for separate and subsequent handling.</p>
<p>Is this “layer-cake approach” the best we can hope for? I do not think so. To do justice to their complex, unified, and ecclesiological subject matter, both biblical and theological studies need each other at all stages of the various processes involved in their subdisciplines.</p>
<p>On the biblical studies side of that relationship, I believe that the focus ought to be on the complexity of the Bible’s subject matter. As Rowe and Hayes maintain, the arguments in favor of “the implicit unity between biblical studies and systematic theology…do not preclude an emphasis within biblical studies on the distinctiveness and particularity of the diverse texts [of Scripture].”<a href="#_ftn28">[28]</a> If, as Jenson has suggested, the ultimate test for theology – in both its individual statements and its comprehensive systems – is its success or failure as a hermeneutic for all of Scripture, then one of the tasks of biblical studies is, as it were, to remind theological studies just how difficult of a test it faces, due to the historical and literary complexities of the Bible<img loading="lazy" src="#_ftn29" alt="[29]"  />
</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, theology is required to remind biblical studies that, thought the biblical texts be admittedly varied, they bear witness to a unified and irreducibly ecclesiological narrative, held together by the story’s author and central character, the triune God. After all, even the moniker “biblical” studies, as opposed to, say, “Ancient Near Eastern” or “Greco-Roman” studies, implies “the theological decision that the particular documents that constitute the Bible are in some way related to one another, as distinct from their relation to other pieces of literature, and are therefore to be treated together.” (Though, as Rowe and Hays also note, this does not settle the question of <em>how</em> biblical texts relate to one another.)<a href="#_ftn30">[30]</a></p>
<h2 id="implications-for-biblical-theology-and-the-theological-interpretation-of-scripture">Implications for Biblical Theology and the Theological Interpretation of Scripture</h2>
<p>This seems like the best time to address the contested and contentious fields of biblical theology [BT] and the theological interpretation of Scripture [TIS]. While I do not have much to add to the ongoing discussion that has taken place between, among others, Bockmuehl, Fowl, Klink and Lockett, and Treier, I do think that conceiving biblical and theological studies as a single, multifaceted discipline adds plausibility to Treier’s “middle way” or “Type 3” approach to relating the two disciplines in a distinct-yet-complementary way.<a href="#_ftn31">[31]</a></p>
<p>Although I do not claim that this is the only right way to define BT, I admit that I am predisposed to think of the sub-discipline in terms of what Klink and Lockett call the “BT2: History of Redemption” approach, as practiced by, among many others, D.A. Carson.<a href="#_ftn32">[32]</a> Thus construed, BT’s goal is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to discern the historical progression of God’s work of redemption through an inductive analysis of key themes developing through both discrete corpora and the whole of Scripture. Major themes such as covenant or kingdom constitute the theological connecting fibers between the Old and New Testaments, and these themes necessarily run along a historical trajectory, giving fundamental structure to the theology of the Bible.<a href="#_ftn33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, although I readily admit the difficulties involved in defining TIS, the main difference that seems to emerge between BT (thus construed) and TIS is the latter’s willingness to read the Bible (1) following the example of certain “pre-critical” exegetes, (2) through the creedal lens of the “Rule of Faith,” and (3) within the interpretive community of the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<a href="#_ftn34">[34]</a></p>
<p>I think that BT and TIS can benefit each other as they seek to deal with the subject matter of Scripture.</p>
<p>Without accepting BT’s (occasionally) a-ecclesiological presuppositions, TIS could benefit from BT’s close reading of biblical texts in order to demonstrate the Bible’s coherence on its own terms. How? First, as evidence that churchly interpreters of Scripture, including so-called pre-critical ones, were not wrong to see a unity in Scripture and its subject matter. Second, the various “key themes” of Scripture that BT isolates can provide TIS with profitable areas for further theological research.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BT could use TIS as a reminder that (1) Scripture itself, and not BT’s synthesis of it, is theologically authoritative and that (2) the Bible does not <em>need</em> to be interpreted exclusively on “its own terms,” for the story to which Scripture bears witness extends beyond the Old and New Testaments to incorporate the story of the Church and the rest of creation.</p>
<p>This may not result in a radical change within BT’s or TIS’s explicit methods (or, perhaps in the case of the latter, the lack thereof), but it would hopefully at least result in greater disciplinary humility and appreciation for (1) the theological authority of Scripture itself, apart from either BT’s or TIS’s elucidations of it, and (2) the Holy Spirit’s role(s) in inspiration, preservation, and interpretation of Scripture throughout the history of the Church.</p>
<h2 id="theological-subdisciplines-need-each-other">Theological Subdisciplines Need Each Other</h2>
<p>If biblical and theological studies ought to be a single, multifaceted discipline, how should we construe the relationships between the various <em>theological</em> sub-disciplines?</p>
<p>As Jenson claims, if theology asks (with) the Church: “Wherein was what we heard and saw the gospel?” and “What are we tomorrow to say and enact in order to say and enact this same gospel?”, then <em>historical</em> theology focuses on the former question and <em>normative</em> theology (which encompasses both <em>systematic</em> and <em>pastoral</em> theology) focuses on the latter.<a href="#_ftn35">[35]</a> Jenson continues to distinguish between pastoral theology, which focuses on “the exigencies of the church’s daily task,” and systematic theology, which “takes up questions posed not only by current urgency but also by perceived inherent connections of the faith.”<a href="#_ftn36">[36]</a> And yet, because of the historical way in which both the Church’s exigencies and the faith’s inherent connections have developed, at some point these distinctions perhaps begin to lose their importance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the various theological sub-disciplines need each other as well.</p>
<p>The historical complexity speaks to the need for historical theology, and the conceptual complexity to the need for systematic theology. The relationship between these two sub-disciplines ought to be much the same as that between biblical and theological studies. That is, historical theology, as it were, can remind systematic theology of the historical particularities and complexities involved in attempting to understand, with the Church, the subject matter of Scripture. Systematic theology can remind historical theology of the complex conceptual unity involved in the task, such that, for example, Augustine and Barth can be put into conversation with one another (regarding a variety of theological <em>loci</em>) without doing undue violence to either.</p>
<p>What role does pastoral theology play? Both historical and systematic theology must be reminded that the subject matter of Scripture is an all-encompassing story, one in which we all cannot help but participate. Furthermore, as Charry is right to note, theology is properly salutary and “aretegenic” (“virtue-producing”) – and not merely cognitive – for God reveals and redeems for the sake of human flourishing.<a href="#_ftn37">[37]</a> Pastoral theology, therefore, asks the crucial question: Given our current situation, how do we participate rightly in the all-encompassing story of the triune God? It thereby prevents historical and systematic theology from losing purchase on their subject matter by forgetting that it <em>matters</em> for life as we now live it.</p>
<h1 id="a-idconclusionaconclusionsummary"><a id="conclusion"></a>CONCLUSION/SUMMARY</h1>
<p>Regarding the enterprise of theological hermeneutics, I have argued that we can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture’s theological authoritative location/role regarding its subject matter – the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God’s people, Scripture is irreducibly ecclesiological.</p>
<p>Because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This means that theology is to be given pride of place in both the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, as well as the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. And yet, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of <em>all</em> authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Finally, I have argued that, given the enormity and importance of Scripture’s subject matter, we ought to conceive of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology – as well as biblical theology and the theological interpretation of Scripture. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.</p>

The trinitarian NT formulas are: Matt 28:19; 1 Cor. 6:11; 12:4ff.; Gal. 3:11-14; Heb. 10:29; 1 Pet. 1:2. William G. Rusch, ed., <em>The Trinitarian Controversy</em>, Sources of Early Christian Thought (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress, 1980), 2. Without denying the importance of such passages, Jenson rightly laments those who “scrabble around in the Bible for bits and pieces of language to cobble together into a sort of Trinity-doctrine – usually with intellectually lamentable and indeed sometimes heretical results.” Robert W. Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” <em>Concordia Theological Quarterly</em> 68, no. 3–4 (2004): 196.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a> Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” 197. Emphasis original. Also, for a similar argument to Jenson’s, which focuses on the text of Philippians 2, see David S. Yeago, “The New Testament and the Nicene Dogma: A Contribution to the Recovery of Theological Exegesis,” <em>Pro Ecclesia</em> 3, no. 2 (1994): 152–64.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a> Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” 199. The divinity of the Father is perhaps the easiest to note throughout the Bible. On the divinity of the Son, see: John 1, 10; Col. 2; Phil. 2; and Heb. 1. On the divinity of the Spirit, see: 1 Cor. 2:11; Heb. 3:7-10; and 10:15-17. I have here stuck to the contours of Jenson’s argument in lieu of the common arguments for the divinity of Son and Spirit, e.g.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a> Jenson, 198–202. The phrase “<em>dramatis personae Dei</em>” is Jenson’s adaptation of Tertullian’s verbiage.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a> Cf. John 5:16-23; Jenson, 199. Although this could perhaps be oversimplification, cf. Marshall’s claim that “the Father is the God of Israel, the Son is the God of Israel, and the Holy Spirit is the God of Israel, yet they are not three Gods of Israel, but one God of Israel.” B. Marshall, “Do Christians Worship the God of Israel” in <em>Knowing the Triune God</em> (ed. J. Buckley and D. Yeago; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001), 258; quoted by Geoffrey Wainwright, “Trinity,” in <em>Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible</em>, ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 817. Nevertheless, Jenson’s main point still stands, by virtue of Jesus’ address to the Father establishing both Fatherhood and Sonship within the Trinity.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a> Cf. Ps. 2:7; Heb. 1:1-14. In addition, Jenson focuses on showing the presence of the Trinity in the OT, where it is so often neglected, by positing that the Son shows up via the themes of the angel of the Lord, the name of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord. Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” 200–203.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref8">[8]</a> Jenson, 199, 204; cf. Gen. 1:2; Ps. 51:11; Isa. 11:2; Ezek. 37:1-14; John 14:15-31; Acts 1:7-8; 2:1-41; Rom. 1:4; 8:11.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref9">[9]</a> “Theo-drama” is a term borrowed from Hans Urs von Balthasar by Kevin Vanhoozer, who approvingly mentions N.T. Wright’s “five-act” framework (creation, fall, Israel, Christ, church), despite preferring the following slightly-modified framework: (1) creation, (2) election of Israel, (3) Christ, (4) Pentecost and the church, (5) consummation. See Vanhoozer, “A Drama-of-Redemption Model: Always Performing?,” 174. Samuel Wells prefers: (1) creation, (2) Israel, (3) Jesus, (4) church, (5) eschaton. See Samuel Wells, <em>Improvisation: The Drama of Christian Ethics</em> (Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2004), 53.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a> See foundational covenant passages, such as Gen. 12, 15, throughout the Old Testament.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref11">[11]</a> Consider, for example, the curses for covenantal unfaithfulness found in Deut. 27:14-26; 28:15-68, culminating with the threat of exile.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref12">[12]</a> As Irenaeus and Athanasius proclaimed: “God became what we are so that we might become what He is.”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref13">[13]</a> Cf. 1 Cor 15:20-22. As the nexus of redemption and re-creation, the resurrection is crucial – for the focus of the atonement is not merely to sentence sin with its proper exile, but to fulfill God’s creative purposes for unity and participation in the divine life.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref21">[21]</a> Treier notes that theological hermeneutics can refer to at least two possible projects, the first focused on general hermeneutics and the second focused on special hermeneutics. With some trepidation, due to the numerous complexities involved, I have taken his comment that “the two projects can occur simultaneously” as an invitation to do so. See Daniel J. Treier, <em>Introducing Theological Interpretation of Scripture: Recovering a Christian Practice</em> (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2008), 136; Daniel J.

<p>You know, if there’s one thing I hate, it’s goodbyes. Anyone else here hate goodbyes?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the fact that I hate them so much means I’m not really very good at goodbyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get awkward and silent. Sometimes I get awkward and really chatty! Heck, sometimes I get awkward and I make poor choices, like the one time when I was getting ready to say goodbye to my family when they dropped me off at college.</p>
<p>They were looking forward to a final dinner with me, in the school cafeteria, before they left. But I was worried about the awkwardness of saying a tearful goodbye between packed tables and chairs, so I suggested that they just leave.</p>
<p>Let’s just say that my family wasn’t very happy. And me? Neither was I. I ate my first college meal all alone.</p>
<p>Goodbyes suck. And I often suck at goodbyes.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, this is my “goodbye” sermon here at St. Peter’s, and I wanted to give an excuse for this sermon, if it sucks!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I do want to thank this congregation for being such a good place for Rachel and me to serve and grow alongside you. Thank you for loving Rachel and me as our brothers and sisters in Christ. We will miss you all very much as we move to Illinois this week.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don’t want this goodbye to get TOO awkward, so I’d better keep on preaching!</p>
<p><strong>I think that goodbyes are bad because they so often leave our stories unfinished.</strong></p>
<p>And we humans tend to hate unfinished business. It’s so much better when the story has an end! Sometimes, even a bad ending is better than no ending at all!</p>
<p>Think about it, if you’re watching an important game on TV – say, Alabama vs. Auburn – would you rather see the ending, even if your team loses, or have the power go out and completely miss the final minutes?</p>
<p>Stories without endings are frustrating. And that’s why it’s so hard to say goodbye.</p>
<p>That’s why Death – the ultimate goodbye, if you will – is so horrible.</p>
<p>It’s not really an ending, not for those of us who go on living, anyways. Instead, Death leaves our stories hanging, with words left unsaid and promises left unfulfilled.</p>
<p>I think here of parents in Manchester this week who were forced to say goodbye to their children all too soon, thanks to the suicide bombing. Or the Coptic Christians in Egypt forced to say goodbye to their loved ones too soon, thanks to the bus attack.</p>
<p>Goodbyes suck, because they leave our stories unfinished.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-ascension-does-it-suck">WHAT ABOUT THE ASCENSION? DOES IT SUCK?</h2>
<p>Is the Ascension of Jesus Christ, then, just another awful goodbye?</p>
<p>I mean, think about the emotional rollercoaster Christ’s followers must have ridden in those days. Rising hopes of God’s coming kingdom dashed to the ground at the Crucifixion – only to rise once more at the Resurrection!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jesus, you’re alive! Surely, surely now’s the time when you’re going to restore the kingdom to Israel, right?!</p>
<p>“I mean, you had us worried there for a minute, what with the whole executed like a common criminal thing… but SURELY now’s the time!</p>
<p>“Seize the day! Take the throne! Kill these Romans, won’t you?! Won’t you?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… Now, I’m sure that the Ascension was glorious. After all, Luke tells us that the disciples worshiped and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</p>
<p>But the Ascension was still a goodbye.</p>
<p>And I’m sure that, eventually, the glory faded as the disciples gazed into heaven. And they needed the angels’ reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Men of Galilee, who do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven” [Acts 1:11].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so maybe it’s fairer to say that the Ascension was a “see-you-later.”</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>But doesn’t the Ascension still leave things hanging?</p>
<p>Doesn’t it still leave our story – and the story of the Gospel – unfinished?</p>
<p>Well, yes…and no.</p>
<p>If I might paraphrase the angels’ message in Acts 1 as the title of my sermon, here it is:</p>
<p><strong>“It’s finished! So, get to work!”</strong></p>
<p>And here’s my main point:</p>
<p><strong>The Ascension completes the Gospel and compels the Church.</strong></p>
<h1 id="how-does-the-ascension-complete-the-gospel">HOW DOES THE ASCENSION COMPLETE THE GOSPEL?</h1>
<p>How does the Ascension complete the Gospel?</p>
<p>Well, that requires knowing what the Gospel is, so here goes:</p>
<h2 id="the-gospel">THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In the beginning, God created the entire universe to be his temple, his kingdom – the place where he would dwell and rule.</p>
<p>And he created human beings – his image-bearers, his ambassadors, his “middle-management” – to extend his rule and reign throughout creation.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this, however, human beings rebelled against God.</p>
<p>Instead of bowing the knee to the King, they tried to steal his throne.</p>
<p>And this rebellion brought Sin and Death into the kingdom – breaking the relationships</p>
<ul>
<li>between God and humanity,</li>
<li>between humanity and itself,</li>
<li>and between humanity and the rest of creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where once there was perfect fellowship and communion, there was now distance and Exile.</p>
<p>And the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, God was not going to let Sin, Death, and Exile have the final word! No!</p>
<p>He would pursue his people, he would buy them back from their slavery to Sin and Death, he would cleanse them from the inside out, and he would – one day – bring them back home.</p>
<p>The story of God’s rescue mission, then, is the Good News – it’s the Gospel.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the story of Israel is the beginning of this rescue mission.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, God draws a people back into covenant relationship with himself.</p>
<p>And yet, the story of the Old Testament is left hanging on a tragic note.</p>
<p>Despite God’s continuing goodness, faithfulness, and salvation, his people prove stubbornly faithless.</p>
<p>And, even though they technically dwell in the geographical Promised Land, they are still in Exile.</p>
<p>They are still ruled, in the halls of power, by their political enemies. And they are still ruled, in their hearts, by Sin and Death.</p>
<p>And the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, in the New Testament, God HIMSELF goes into Exile INSTEAD OF his people, in order to bring them back home.</p>
<p>I’d like you to picture this as a capital letter “V”.</p>
<p>Up here, you’ve got the eternal Son of God – fully divine.</p>
<p>Down here, is us. Drowning, as it were, in a cesspool of Sin and Death.</p>
<p>And instead of abandoning us…</p>
<p>(Heck, even instead of somehow saving us at an arm’s distance, after we start to clean up and get our act together.)</p>
<p>…Christ dives headfirst into the muck – into the cesspool of sin-stained human existence.</p>
<p>We call this the Incarnation.</p>
<p>So, great! God’s with us! In..this…cesspool! …Great?</p>
<p>At the Crucifixion, Jesus goes all the way to the very bottom point of that capital V.</p>
<p>He goes all the way into the furthest, farthest Exile – Death.</p>
<p>So, great! God’s dead.</p>
<p>How is this good news?!</p>
<p>Well, the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, he went into the farthest Exile, so that we wouldn’t have to.</p>
<p>And he didn’t stay in the grave. No no no!</p>
<p>There’s another side to the capital V!</p>
<p>We can’t forget the Resurrection!</p>
<p>Jesus arose from the grave – he walked out of that tomb on Easter morning AAAAANNNNND…..</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Well, we don’t know.</p>
<p>He appeared to some people. And then, well, we’re not really sure what happened to him.</p>
<p>We’re not really sure what it all meant.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The story would have ended there, left hanging between tragedy and triumph, were it not for the Ascension.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-ascension-completes-the-gospel">HOW THE ASCENSION COMPLETES THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we can’t forget the Ascension!</p>
<p>The Ascension COMPLETES the Gospel!</p>
<p>The Ascension is the final step in Christ’s return from Exile.</p>
<p>And, if we are united with Christ as a part of his body, the Church, the Ascension is the completion of OUR return from Exile as well!</p>
<p>The Ascension demonstrates that the Crucifixion and Resurrection were the final victory over Sin and Death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that Christ is not only crucified, and not only risen, but also ascended, and glorified, and seated on his heavenly throne means that he is the LORD.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, though still fully human, though still fully acquainted with our many griefs, is not your buddy.</p>
<p>He’s not your pal that you can ignore at your convenience.</p>
<p>No, the Ascension reminds us that Christ is our King.</p>
<p>He is our Lord. And he is to be obeyed.</p>
<p>But, hey, since the capital V is finished, and Christ is on the throne, that means that we can all just sit around and do nothing, right?!</p>
<p>As long as we’re not doing something horrible?</p>
<p>I mean, the story’s OVER! I thought that’s what you just said, Josh.</p>
<p>No, not quite!</p>
<p>The Ascension does complete the Gospel – as its goal and culmination.</p>
<p>We will all one day be with Christ at the Father’s right hand in glory.</p>
<p>But the story’s not over, because the Ascension also compels the Church.</p>
<p>The Ascension completes the Gospel, and it also compels the Church.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-the-ascension-compel-the-church">HOW DOES THE ASCENSION COMPEL THE CHURCH?</h1>
<p>How does the Ascension compel the Church?</p>
<p>Well, <strong>the Ascension gives the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>its global mission,</strong></li>
<li><strong>its enduring hope,</strong></li>
<li><strong>and its enabling power.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone with me so far?</p>
<p>We’ve talked about the Ascension’s theological significance, how the Ascension completes the Gospel.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the Ascension’s application to our lives – how the Ascension should both challenge us and encourage us.</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-global-mission">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS GLOBAL MISSION</h2>
<p>Here’s the challenge of the Ascension: it gives the Church its global mission.</p>
<p>As Luke told us twice today – in the book of Acts and the Gospel which bears his name – Jesus commissioned his followers as witnesses who were to proclaim the Good News across cultural and ethnic boundaries.</p>
<p>“to all nations” – that word, “nations,” ethnoi, more properly refers to people groups, to cultural and ethnic groups of people, than to modern nation states.</p>
<p>That is, there are plenty of ethnoi represented right here in the United States – including those that haven’t yet heard the gospel!</p>
<p>You remember what I said a minute ago about Jesus not being our buddy?</p>
<p>He’s our King! He’s to be obeyed!</p>
<p>And he wants us to proclaim the gospel to the entire world.</p>
<p>Which, let’s be honest, is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because God’s global gospel runs counter to the nationalistic, tribalistic, and individualistic “gospels” of this earth.</p>
<p>The Good News of God’s global kingdom – won not through self-promotion or military conquest but through self-sacrifice and loving one’s enemies – this gospel runs counter to the false gospels of this world, including the false gospel of the American Dream.</p>
<p>And that cuts right across the grain of the entire political landscape – red state and blue state.</p>
<p>Now to be sure, hear me!, there is a difference between globalism and God’s global gospel.</p>
<p>But there is also a stark difference between the United States of America and the Kingdom of God – between American culture and Kingdom culture.</p>
<p>Let us, then, take heed, lest we American Christians make assimilation to American culture an unofficial prerequisite for the nations of the world.</p>
<p>There is no prerequisite.</p>
<p>There is no response of the world that gives the Church an excuse to abandon its global mission.</p>
<p>In light of the Ascension, the Church’s global mission is to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ across all cultural and ethnic boundaries – obeying its Ascended Lord, who once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” [Matt. 5:43-44].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so this transcultural, enemy-loving gospel stuff sounds great hypothetically, but</p>
<ul>
<li>what about when people blow themselves up to kill children at a concert in Manchester?</li>
<li>What about when people open fire on a bus full of Coptic Christians on their way to pray?</li>
<li>What about when they go on shooting sprees in shopping malls, movie theaters, schools, and churches?</li>
<li>Or what about when people are just so different, so unfamiliar, so awkward, that we just don’t know what to say?</li>
</ul>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>Do we throw up our hands in despair?</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-enduring-hope">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS ENDURING HOPE</h2>
<p>Here’s the encouragement of the Ascension: it gives the Church its enduring hope.</p>
<p>Without the Ascension, we are left wondering whether the good news of Christ’s resurrection will extend to us.</p>
<p>We are left wondering whether the chaos in the world around us will ever cease.</p>
<p>How long, O Lord? How long before you stay the hand of the wicked?</p>
<p>How long before you destroy the earthly powers and dominions and authorities that divide us and destroy us?</p>
<p>Friends, we can still ask these questions today, but it makes all the difference in the world that Christ has ascended.</p>
<p>It makes all the difference in the world that Christ has been enthroned over all earthly powers and dominions and authorities.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the Ascension shows that Christ has triumphed over his enemies.</p>
<p>The way of the Cross has won out over the sinful ways of this world.</p>
<p>And the Ascension also anticipates the second coming of Christ.</p>
<p>Just like Jesus did not stay in the grave, he will not stay at a distance upon his heavenly throne – present in the Church only sacramentally.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>And just like he did not let Sin and Death have the final word, he will not let the servants of Sin and Death have the final word, either.</p>
<p>Instead, he will one day stay the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p>He will one day disarm and destroy those who have decided to persist in rebellion against him.</p>
<p>Christ is enthroned over all earthly powers! This is our enduring hope!</p>
<p>There’s no reason for us to hedge our bets, as it were, by bending the knee to any earthly power – friend or foe.</p>
<p>Instead, the Church can freely exist for the sake of the world, because we know that the world is in the hands of our ascended King.</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-enabling-power-the-holy-spirit">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS ENABLING POWER: THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>So, you know, just get out there and try harder to love people and let them know about Jesus, no matter how different they are!</p>
<p>Right?!</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>We’re not fooling anyone. We can’t do this on our own.</p>
<p>Sure, we’ve got a global mission. And sure, we’ve got an enduring hope.</p>
<p>But we still need enabling power.</p>
<p>And the Ascension gives the Church its enabling power: the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>At the end of Luke’s Gospel, Jesus tells his disciples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high” [Luke 24:53].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, at the beginning of Acts, Jesus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, ‘you heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now” [Acts 1:4-5].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few verses later, Jesus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” [Acts 1:8].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I know I’m getting a bit ahead of myself.</p>
<p>After all, it’s still a week until Pentecost!</p>
<p>But, brothers and sisters, we can’t make it, not even for a week, without the Holy Spirit!</p>
<p>We are only gathered here this morning, some two thousand years since the Ascension, on the other side of the world, because the Holy Spirit has empowered the Church to fulfill its global mission.</p>
<p>And, even though we live in a divided, divisive, and terrifying world, the Holy Spirit can empower the Church today.</p>
<p>So, thanks be to God that the Ascension and Pentecost go hand in hand!</p>
<h3 id="the-ascension-completes-the-gospel-and-compels-the-church-to-fulfill-its-global-mission-clinging-to-its-enduring-hope-empowered-by-the-holy-spirit">THE ASCENSION COMPLETES THE GOSPEL AND COMPELS THE CHURCH TO FULFILL ITS GLOBAL MISSION, CLINGING TO ITS ENDURING HOPE, EMPOWERED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h3>
<p>So, Father, we thank you for your persistence and patience to rescue us from Sin and Death.</p>
<p>Jesus, we bow the knee and worship you, our Ascended Lord. And we ask you to come again soon and make all things new.</p>
<p>And Holy Spirit, we ask you come. Give us the strength to love our neighbors and our enemies by proclaiming and living the gospel.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;There is something special about last meals, isn’t there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to show you a series of photographs. These photographs, except for the last one – which I added, are from &lt;a href=&#34;http://henryhargreaves.com/no-seconds&#34;&gt;a piece called “No Seconds,” and they were put together by Henry Hargreaves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to belabor the artwork with my commentary, so I’ll give you a few seconds to take each slide in.&lt;/p&gt;

The whole idea of a criminal’s last meal affects me deeply. Why?
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The whole idea of a criminal’s last meal affects me deeply. Why?
<p>I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.</p>
<p>While Jesus of Nazareth was no common criminal, his so-called “Last Supper” with his disciples was a poignant combination of the expected and the unexpected. And when you take a look at the Last Supper, focusing on its unexpected elements, you find out that it’s really a Lasting Supper.</p>
<p>That is, the Last Supper is not just a one-time event, some two-thousand years ago. Instead, Holy Communion, the Lasting Supper, is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.</p>
<h1 id="the-meal"><strong>The Meal</strong></h1>
<p>First, let’s look at the original meal itself, the “Last Supper,” as described in our Gospel lesson (Luke 22:14-20).</p>
<h2 id="passover-an-interpretive-celebration">Passover: An Interpretive Celebration</h2>
<p>Now, as expected, the Passover was an interpretive celebration, because it looked back to the Exodus event – when God rescued his people from slavery in Egypt – in order to explain what salvation looked like.</p>
<p>That is, if you asked any respectable Hebrew what it meant to “be saved,” you would much more likely hear “it’s like when God saved us from Egypt” than “you get to go to heaven after you die.”</p>
<p>Although Passover originated with Exodus 12’s instructions for a hasty meal, eaten while standing a fully dressed, by Jesus’ time the meal had evolved into an elaborate affair.</p>
<p>As best we can tell, in Jesus’ day the meal was structured around four cups of wine. According to New Testament scholar Joel Green, the meal had the following outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>The head of the family would pronounce a blessing over the first cup of wine, which was then shared.</li>
<li>Before the second cup, the youngest son would ask the father questions about what made this night special.</li>
<li>The father would reply by telling the Exodus story, focusing on the summary given in Deut. 26:5-11.</li>
<li>The dinner party would then sing Psalm 113, and then drink the second cup of wine.</li>
<li>The father would then bless, break, and distribute the unleavened bread, followed by the main meal.</li>
<li>Finally, they would consume two more cups of wine, before singing Psalms 114-118.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>Because we need to realize that the Passover was no ordinary meal.</p>
<p>Instead, it was an interpretive meal. Words went right along with the food, in order to situate the dinner party in the midst of God’s ongoing Story of Salvation.</p>
<p>Especially given the combination of the Exodus story with the prayers and praises found in Psalms 113-118, the Passover was</p>
<ul>
<li>a remembrance of God’s past deliverance,</li>
<li>a celebration of God’s present faithfulness,</li>
<li>and an anticipation of God’s future deliverance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The past, the present, and the future came together in one meal.</p>
<p>Here’s the framework, or the timeline, if you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original Passover meal (Exod. 12)</li>
<li>The Exodus from Egypt</li>
<li>The establishment of the Covenant</li>
<li>Yearly remembrance of the Passover</li>
<li>In hope of future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>Got that?</p>
<p>Passover, Exodus, Covenant, Remembrance, Hope.</p>
<p>OK, so this is really important: Israel didn’t merely remember the Passover each year to <em><strong>know</strong></em> something but in order to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>change</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>In other words, Passover was supposed to be a transformative remembrance.</p>
<p>Remembering God’s faithfulness was supposed to transform them into God’s faithful followers. Remembering God’s faithfulness was supposed to transform them into God’s faithful covenant partners.</p>
<p>So much for the expected aspects of the Last Supper: it was an interpretive Passover.</p>
<h2 id="an-unexpected-paradigm-shift">An Unexpected Paradigm Shift</h2>
<p>What is unexpected about this meal is how Jesus shifts the paradigm! He takes the whole “Passover, Exodus, Covenant, Remembrance, Hope” timeline and makes himself the center of it!</p>
<p>As the “head of the household,” it’s not strange that Jesus would be the chief speaker during this Passover Meal. However, in vv. 15-16, things start to get weird. Jesus frames the meal as his last meal, prophetically looking forward to his suffering and death.</p>
<p>And yet, perhaps it’s better to say his “second-to-last meal,” because in verses 16 – 18, he predicts that death will not have the final word. Instead, he will partake of the full and final Passover again in the coming kingdom of God!</p>
<p>Remember, we’re expecting Jesus to give an explanation and interpretation of the Exodus story. When Jesus takes the bread and the wine, we expect him to say: “do this in remembrance of the Exodus from Egypt…do this in remembrance of the Covenant.”</p>
<p>Instead, he says: “do this in remembrance of ME!”</p>
<p>This shifts the timeline forward, from Israel’s transformative remembrance of the Passover to the Church’s transformative remembrance of the fulfillment of the Passover, the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>Passover points to the Lord’s Supper, Holy Communion.</p>
<h2 id="new-exodus-new-covenant">New Exodus, New Covenant</h2>
<p>What about the Exodus and the Covenant? Do they point to anything?</p>
<p>They do!</p>
<p>Both the Exodus and the Covenant are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, through the New Exodus and the New Covenant!</p>
<p>In the original Exodus, God saved his people, through Moses, from slavery in Egypt.</p>
<p>In the New Exodus, God saves his people, through Jesus Christ, from slavery to Sin and Death.</p>
<p>In the original Covenant, God gives his people the Law, through Moses, written upon tablets of stone.</p>
<p>In the New Covenant, God gives his people the Law, the Gospel! through Jesus Christ, and writes it upon their hearts.</p>
<p>We see this first in Jesus’ unexpected words about the bread, interpreted as Christ’s battered body.</p>
<p>Look at verse 19. Instead of the expected words about the Passover lamb at this point in the meal, Luke speaks only of Christ’s body, sacrificially “given” for the sake of his disciples.</p>
<p>Then, in verse 20, there are Jesus’ even more shocking words about the cup, which is interpreted as New Covenant blood!</p>
<p>Because the Jews were strictly prohibited from consuming blood (Deut. 12:16, 23-4), there were probably quite a few audible sputters when Christ declared: “this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood” (Luke 22:20)!</p>
<p>Jesus is claiming that, just as the Old Covenant was ratified by blood (see Exod. 24:8), his impending death will ratify the New Covenant of Jeremiah 31:31-34. The sacrifice will be God himself, upon the Cross!</p>
<p>And, according to Jeremiah 31, the New Covenant will bring</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of God,</li>
<li>loyalty to God, and</li>
<li>forgiveness of sins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yahweh says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.</p>
<p>And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord.</p>
<p>For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more” (Jer. 31:33-34).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="passover-and-holy-communion-an-expanded-timeline">Passover and Holy Communion: An Expanded Timeline</h2>
<p>So, to review, the previous timeline was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original Passover</li>
<li>Original Exodus</li>
<li>Establishment of the Covenant</li>
<li>Israel’s Remembrance in Passover meals</li>
<li>Hope for future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the church’s timeline builds upon the previous one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original Last Supper</li>
<li>New Exodus (accomplished at Cross)</li>
<li>New Covenant (accomplished at Cross)</li>
<li>Church’s Remembrance in Holy Communion</li>
<li>Hope for future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>In Holy Communion, we Christians are called to the transformative remembrance of what Christ has accomplished at the Cross.</p>
<p>But we don’t just look back to the Cross. We also look forward to what Jesus will accomplish at the final redemption. You know, when he returns to judge the living and the dead, to right every wrong, and to wipe away every tear!</p>
<p>When we take Holy Communion, we await the heavenly banquet that will fully fulfill both the Passover and the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>Everyone with me so far?</p>
<p>Just as Passover was designed to be a transformative remembrance, to shape the Israelites into faithful followers of God, so too Holy Communion is a transformative remembrance.</p>
<p>It’s meant to transform us into faithful followers of Jesus Christ, faithful members of Christ’s body, the Church!</p>
<h1 id="what-does-transformative-remembrance-look-like">What Does Transformative Remembrance Look Like?</h1>
<p>But, what does that look like?</p>
<p>Sure, I’ve mentioned that the New Covenant is meant to result in</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of God,</li>
<li>loyalty to god,</li>
<li>and the forgiveness of sins.</li>
</ul>
<p>But seriously: What does that look like?</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at the rest of our passage, Luke 22:21-30.</p>
<p>Is anyone else confused by how quickly the scene seems to change?</p>
<p>I mean, one moment (v. 20), Jesus is saying the words of institution, and then the very next moment (v. 21-22) Jesus is predicting his betrayal!</p>
<p>In v. 23, the disciples are understandably confused. But then (v. 24) they immediately start bickering about who’s the greatest disciple!</p>
<p>So, Jesus has to remind them (vv. 25-30) that, in his kingdom, true greatness and authority come only through sacrificial service.</p>
<p>What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>I think that these final scenes in our passage offer us a challenging reminder of how the Lord’s Lasting Supper should shape us.</p>
<p>They show us, albeit through the failure of Judas and the disciples, how the remembrance of Holy Communion should transform us into sacrificial servants of Jesus Christ and one another.</p>
<h2 id="servants-or-traitors">Servants? Or Traitors?</h2>
<p>Let me put it to you this way:</p>
<p><strong>When you come to the Lord’s Table, you either come as a servant or a traitor.</strong></p>
<p>You either live a life of serving as you are served by Jesus, or you live a life of grabbing glory and honor and power for yourself.</p>
<p>In our New Testament lesson from 1 Corinthians, the Apostle Paul said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
<p>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup” (1 Cor. 11:27-28).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you can ask yourself many different questions during this process of self-examination, but here’s one for your consideration: do my “table manners” match Jesus’ table manners?</p>
<p>Here are some of the last words of exhortation Jesus gives to his disciples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors.</p>
<p>But not so with you.</p>
<p>Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.</p>
<p>For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves?</p>
<p>Is it not the one who reclines at table?</p>
<p>But I am among you as the one who serves” (Luke 22:25-27).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve got good news, friends: <strong>Jesus is still among us today as the one who serves.</strong></p>
<p>Like always, he gives us his very self, for the sake of our salvation.</p>
<p>Will we follow his example? Will we gratefully accept his service, and – in joyful response to his salvation – serve others in Jesus’ name? Or will we come in betrayal, seeking honor for only ourselves?</p>
<h2 id="foot-washing">Foot Washing</h2>
<p>Now, during our service of Holy Communion, we are going to have a service of Foot-Washing. During that time, I’d like you to remember that the same Lord who washed his disciples’ feet – the dirtiest parts of their bodies – now washes away even the dirtiest parts of our lives with his blood.</p>
<p>And I’d like you to ask yourself: <strong>are you living a life of Christ-like service?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, maybe you don’t wash other people’s feet all the time, but are you willing to sacrificially serve others, as you yourself have been served by Jesus?</p>
<p>The answer, by the way, is NOT “try harder! Be better! Serve more!” No!</p>
<p>INSTEAD, it is to surrender your entire life to Jesus. Only when you’ve accepted his salvation and his lordship will you be able to serve others out of the overflow of Christ’s love in your life.</p>
<h2 id="the-lords-table">The Lord’s Table</h2>
<p>And of course, in addition to the foot-washing, we will come to the Lord’s Table. And, during that time, I’d like you to remember that the same Messiah who so frequently ate with outcasts and sinners now welcomes us outcasts and sinners to come to his table and receive the saving benefits of his broken body and his shed blood.</p>
<p>Friends, <strong>do our table manners match Jesus’ table manners?</strong> Are we reaching out to outcasts and sinners and welcoming them to our tables at home? Are we letting the hurting, the lost, and the broken around us know where they can find food and drink that lead to true, everlasting life?</p>
<p>Remember: <strong>the Lasting Supper is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you come to the Lord’s table, you either come as a traitor or a servant.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks be to God, who invites us all to the table of our Lord Jesus Christ, where he is the gracious host and we are the rebellious traitors who are transformed into faithful servants.</p>
<p><em>Amen</em>.</p>

<h2 id="opening-prayer">Opening Prayer</h2>
<p>God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote your <strong>justice</strong></li>
<li>embody your <strong>steadfast faithful love</strong></li>
<li>and <strong>humbly</strong> obey Your will,</li>
</ul>
<p>even if it costs us our <em>reputations</em>, and even if it costs us our <em>lives</em>.</p>
<p>I ask that this transformation would begin with <strong>me</strong>. In Jesus’ name. <em>Amen</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’d like to start off with a very basic question: <strong>Do you want to get ahead in life?</strong></p>
<p>Do you want things to get better? Do you want your life, and your children’s lives, to improve?</p>
<p>I mean, despite the many things that divide us humans, don’t we all want progress? When it comes right down to it, don’t we all just want to get ahead?</p>
<p><em><strong>I know I do.</strong></em></p>
<p>In fact, as the students in our youth group could tell you, this is one of the reasons why I love “life hacks”!</p>
<p>Have you heard of life hacks? They’re these little tips and tricks to get ahead in life while saving time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Like, one of my favorite life hacks is the “coffee nap.” You drink a cup of coffee, then immediately take a 20-minute nap, so that the caffeine kicks in right as you wake up.</p>
<p>Life hack. Try it sometime. Thank me later.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS, we all want to get ahead in life. Right?</p>
<p>But there’s a problem: How do we know what <em>getting ahead</em> looks like?</p>
<p>I mean, think about it. Getting ahead can look quite different in different contexts. Right?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is too crude of an example for a sermon, but getting ahead in a drinking game looks totally different than getting ahead in Alcoholics Anonymous!</p>
<p>Getting ahead in the NBA Finals hopefully looks different than getting ahead in playing basketball with your kids.</p>
<p>Getting ahead on Wall Street as a day-trader hopefully looks different than getting ahead in running a charity.</p>
<p>In order to get ahead,</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to know the <strong>context</strong>,</li>
<li>you have to know the <strong>rules</strong>,</li>
<li>you have to know the <strong>goal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, no matter how hard you try, you’re not really going to get ahead. You’ll just be getting ahead at the wrong thing. Which means you’ll fail.</p>
<p>So here’s the kicker: <strong>Getting ahead in God’s eyes looks a whole lot different than getting ahead in the world’s eyes.</strong></p>
<p>The world is a different context. The world follows different rules. And the world has a different goal than God’s Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-point">The Main Point</h2>
<p>In fact, and here’s my main point if you want to write it down:</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foolish</span> in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<h2 id="gods-upside-down-kingdom--1-corinthians-118-31">God’s Upside-Down Kingdom – 1 Corinthians 1:18-31</h2>
<p>Now, this is the message of all of our readings for today, but I’d like to start with the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:18. (You can find it on page 952 in your pew Bible.)</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 1:18 says:</p>
<p><em><strong>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing</strong></em> (that’s what I’m calling “the world,” by the way – those who are perishing), <em><strong>but to us who are being saved</strong></em> (that is, to us who are a part of God’s Kingdom) <em><strong>it is the power of God.</strong></em></p>
<p>You see, <strong><u>God’s not against getting ahead</u></strong>. In fact, you could even say that God is on a mission to “Make Creation Great Again”!</p>
<p>I’m not kidding! He made it great in the first place – a perfect universe with perfect relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation.</p>
<p>However, ever since we humans rebelled against God – ever since Sin shattered the relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation – God has been on a mission to put everything back together again.</p>
<p>Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>So why is Paul saying that the good news of God’s rescue mission is <em><strong>foolishness</strong></em> to the world?</p>
<p>Because God makes creation great again in a totally unexpected way!</p>
<p><strong>This is what I mean by “<u>God’s upside-down kingdom</u>.”</strong></p>
<p>In order to make the world right again, God shows up and <strong>reverses</strong> the ways the world has gotten used to working. And the greatest reversal of all in God’s upside-down kingdom is when <strong>the eternal Son of God becomes <u>human</u> and gets himself <u>killed</u> for the sins of the entire world.</strong></p>
<p>The world expects</p>
<ul>
<li>power,</li>
<li>might,</li>
<li>strength,</li>
<li>and victory,</li>
</ul>
<p>and we receive instead a</p>
<ul>
<li>naked,</li>
<li>abandoned</li>
<li>Middle-Eastern man,</li>
<li>brutally executed</li>
<li>as a political criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>We receive a <em><strong>bloody example</strong></em> for those who would dare challenge the kingdoms of this world.</p>
<p>We receive a <em><strong>Crucified</strong></em> <em><strong>Savior</strong></em>. And the world calls that absolutely <em><strong><u>RIDICULOUS</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>Because, to the world, you don’t get ahead by <strong>laying your life down</strong> (like Jesus did). You get ahead by <em><u>taking what’s yours</u></em>.</p>
<p>You don’t get ahead by <strong>hanging out with the wrong crowd</strong> (like Jesus did). You’re supposed to <em><u>rub shoulders with the rich and the famous</u></em>, not the <strong>poor</strong> and the <strong>homeless</strong>.</p>
<p>You’re not supposed to <strong>focus on the people at the bottom and at the border</strong> (like Jesus did)!</p>
<p>For crying out loud, you’re supposed to get out there and <em><u>hustle</u></em>!</p>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Climb the ladder! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Make deals! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Take no prisoners! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Make demands! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Get ahead!</u></em></li>
</ul>
<p>…And get right back where we need to be saved <em><strong><u>FROM</u></strong></em>!</p>
<p><em><strong>That’s where the world’s ways get us.</strong></em></p>
<p>Where every human is</p>
<ul>
<li>an egotistical island,</li>
<li>competing with God,</li>
<li>alienating other humans,</li>
<li>and abusing creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, as Paul tells us in <strong>[<u>1 Cor 1:25</u>]</strong>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God saves us through what looks like foolishness and weakness.</p>
<p>Why? So that we would not boast in our pathetic “wisdom” and “strength.”</p>
<p>Instead, we are to boast only in the true wisdom and strength of God.</p>
<p>Paul continues in <strong>[<u>1 Cor. 1:27</u>]</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But God chose what is <u>foolish</u> in the world to shame the <u>wise</u>; God chose what is <u>weak</u> in the world to shame the <u>strong</u>; <sup>28 </sup>God chose what is <u>low</u> and <u>despised</u> in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, <sup>29 </sup>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, then, is the <strong>upside-down Kingdom of God</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="blessed-are-the-losers--matthew-51-12">Blessed are the “Losers” – Matthew 5:1-12</h2>
<p>And it’s the exact same Kingdom that we find in the Beatitudes of Matthew 5.</p>
<p>(FYI: We call them the “Beatitudes” because of the Latin word for “blessed/happy” – <em>beatus</em>.)</p>
<p>Now, remember: <strong>God isn’t against getting ahead. He really does want what’s <u>best</u> for us.</strong></p>
<p>But the danger is that we’ll try to get ahead on our own, in our own way. And if we do that, <strong><u>we’ll miss the point in at least two ways. </u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First, we won’t realize that <strong>we desperately need a Savior</strong>, and that <strong>we cannot save ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>Second, we will <strong>ignore</strong> the very <strong>people</strong> that God wants us to <strong>care for</strong> in order to really get ahead in his Kingdom!</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on our own</span>, we’re going to focus on those at the <strong>center</strong> and <strong>height</strong> of <strong>power</strong>. You know, “The Winners.”</p>
<p>But <u>God focuses</u> on those at the <strong>bottom</strong> and at the <strong>borders</strong>, the <strong>edges</strong> of society. You know, “The Losers.”</p>
<p><em>These</em> are the people who will experience God’s favor in his Upside-Down Kingdom. Take a look at [<strong><u>Matthew 5:3-12</u></strong>].</p>
<p>Notice how Jesus declares God’s favor, His blessing, to what the world would call the “wrong kind of people.”</p>
<ul>
<li>To the <strong>poor</strong> in spirit</li>
<li>Those who <strong>mourn</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>meek</strong></li>
<li>Those who <strong>hunger</strong> and thirst for righteousness</li>
<li>The <strong>merciful</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>pure</strong> in heart</li>
<li>The <strong>peacemakers</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>persecuted</strong></li>
<li>And the <strong>reviled</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And notice as well, that the blessings frequently involve <strong>reversals</strong>. The world is giving them one thing, but God is going to give them another.</p>
<p>Now, this is important: these famous words are a <strong><u>mixture</u></strong> of <strong>encouragement</strong> and <strong>instruction</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, Jesus isn’t just giving us a TO-DO LIST in order to get as much blessing as possible. He’s not saying “Go out there and try harder to be poor, persecuted, hungry, mourners.”</p>
<p>Now, Jesus IS <strong>instructing</strong>, more on that in a second. <strong>But</strong> he is first offering divine <strong>encouragement</strong> to those who are <em><strong><u>already</u></strong></em> in those situations.</p>
<h2 id="the-beatitudes-an-interpretive-translation">The Beatitudes: An Interpretive Translation</h2>
<p>Here’s my interpretive translation of the Beatitudes. Follow along with each one if you’ve got a Bible in front of you.</p>
<p>Jesus is saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) “Take heart! Things aren’t what they seem! If you <strong>lack resources</strong> and realize that God alone can save you, then you might not feel like a part of the Roman kingdom. But <strong>you’re a part of God’s Kingdom</strong>.”</li>
<li>(2) “Be encouraged! If you <strong>bear</strong> and <strong>grieve</strong> the <strong>sufferings</strong> of the world, then the kings of the world probably won’t give you much <strong>comfort</strong>. <strong>But God, your true King, will.</strong></li>
<li>(3) Take heart! If you <strong>humbly</strong> and <strong>gently</strong> <strong>refuse</strong> to seek <strong>vengeance</strong> or <strong>power</strong>, then you probably won’t inherit much from the world’s kingdoms. <strong>But God will give you an inheritance in His Kingdom</strong>.</li>
<li>(4) Be encouraged! If you <strong>pursue God’s will above all else</strong>, then you’ll probably go <strong>hungry</strong> in this world. But you will be <strong>satisfied</strong> in God’s Kingdom, where His <strong>will</strong> is <strong>obeyed</strong>.</li>
<li>(5) Take heart! If you show <strong>mercy</strong> and <strong>compassion</strong> to a suffering world, you might not receive much mercy back! <strong>But you yourselves will be shown mercy by God.</strong></li>
<li>(6) Be encouraged! If you <strong>single-mindedly</strong> pursue God’s will, then you probably won’t experience the world’s glory. <strong>But</strong> <strong>you will experience God’s glory and presence.</strong></li>
<li>(7) Take heart! If you <strong>pursue</strong> <strong>reconciliation</strong> and <strong>reject violence</strong>, then you probably won’t reflect the character of this world. <strong>But you will reflect the character of God.</strong></li>
<li>(8) Take heart! Because when this world <strong>rejects</strong> you, <strong>insults</strong> you, <strong>lies</strong> about you, and <strong>persecutes</strong> you, then it may not look like it, <strong>but you’re in good company! You’re in the company of your Savior, Jesus Christ.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Friends, if you’re here today and you’re at the bottom of this world, then I <strong>encourage</strong> you to <strong>cling</strong> to the divine <strong>promises</strong> of <strong>blessing</strong> in the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>God is in the process of making all things new – <strong>reversing</strong> every wrong in this world. <em><strong><u>Take heart.</u></strong></em></p>
<p>However, and perhaps this is uncomfortable to talk about, <strong>what if we’re NOT on this list?</strong></p>
<p>What if we’re NOT</p>
<ul>
<li>poor,</li>
<li>mourning,</li>
<li>meek,</li>
<li>hungry,</li>
<li>merciful,</li>
<li>pure-hearted,</li>
<li>peacemakers</li>
<li>who are persecuted?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if we’re</p>
<ul>
<li>reasonably well-educated</li>
<li>and wealthy,</li>
<li>comfortable,</li>
<li>powerful</li>
<li>American</li>
<li>Christians?</li>
</ul>
<p>How should we respond to the Beatitudes?</p>
<p>While I <strong>DON’T</strong> think that the Beatitudes should be read like a <strong>TO-DO list</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>I DO think that the Beatitudes are an <u>instructive</u> <u>challenge</u> to followers of Jesus.</strong></p>
<p>There is a reason why the Beatitudes are at the beginning of Jesus’ quintessential sermon.</p>
<p>It’s almost like Jesus is saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“OK, you want to follow me?</p>
<p>You want to be a part of my coming Kingdom? Then let’s get really clear on <strong>what this Kingdom is going to be like</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be the kind of Kingdom you’re used to in this world.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of kingdom where the <strong>wealthy</strong>, <strong>wise</strong>, and <strong>powerful</strong> get <u>rewarded</u>.</p>
<p>Instead, in MY Kingdom, <strong>the people who get <u>chewed up</u> and <u>spit out</u> by the kingdoms of this world will be <u>rewarded</u> and <u>honored</u>.</strong></p>
<p>SO,</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want to be a part of my Kingdom,</li>
<li>if you want to “get ahead” in my Kingdom,</li>
<li>then <strong>you better show concrete concern for</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>the oppressed,</strong></li>
<li><strong>the marginalized,</strong></li>
<li><strong>and the weak!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as you do so, you’d better be prepared to end up among the oppressed and the marginalized, because the world is going to think you are out of your minds!”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fear-is-not-a-valid-excuse">Fear is NOT a Valid Excuse</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, remember:</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But there is no escape clause from the rules of God’s Kingdom!</strong></p>
<p>That is, you can’t just ignore Jesus and the Bible because you’re SCARED.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>how a congregation is going to respond to your sermon,</strong></li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>looking foolish</strong>,</li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>losing your job</strong>,</li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>a terrorist attack</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not that Jesus doesn’t care about your fears. He does.</p>
<p><em><strong>But let’s not kid ourselves!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>FEAR</strong> is not a valid excuse for ignoring the Bible’s repeated commands for God’s people to show faithful concern for the kinds of people the world ignores and mistreats!</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="application-consistently-pro-life-for-the-unborn-and-the-refugees">Application: Consistently Pro-Life, for the Unborn AND the Refugees</h2>
<p>So, let’s get practical here. How should we respond to these passages about God’s Upside-Down Kingdom?</p>
<p>We must show concrete concern for the powerless. And two recent issues come to mind, that I would be a coward not to mention.</p>
<h3 id="abortion">Abortion</h3>
<p><strong><u>First</u></strong>, in light of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Life_(Washington,_D.C.)">44th March for Life</a> held this past weekend, <strong>I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that we must continue to stand up for the unborn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abortion</strong> is a gruesome <strong>evil</strong>. And like other forms of evil, it is complex – not easily eradicated.</p>
<p>As Christians, we must wage war against this evil. And that will involve caring not only for the <strong>unborn child</strong>, but also the <strong>mother</strong>, and the child <strong>after</strong> it is born, and the entire <strong>family</strong>.</p>
<p>Repealing Roe v. Wade isn’t going to completely solve the problem.</p>
<p>Christians will have to step up to the plate and be <strong>consistently pro-life</strong> in order to fix things.</p>
<p>If you’re passionate about this issue, I encourage you to check out the organization <a href="http://anglicansforlife.org/"><strong>Anglicans for Life</strong></a> at <strong><a href="http://anglicansforlife.org/">AnglicansForLife.Org</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>So, first, we must stand up for the unborn.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="refugees">Refugees</h3>
<p><strong><u>Second</u></strong>, given <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/01/trump-immigration-order-muslims/514844/">President Trump’s recent executive actions</a> to halt the acceptance of all refugees to the USA, including a temporary moratorium on seven predominantly Muslim countries,</p>
<p><strong>I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that, if we are to be consistently pro-life, we must also stand up for the <u>refugees</u>.</strong></p>
<p>Next to the unborn, refugees around the world – but especially from Syria – are among the most <strong>vulnerable</strong> and <strong>powerless</strong> people in the world.</p>
<p>Christians should be standing up for and supporting these people. And, to their credit, many Christians are doing so.</p>
<p>I’d encourage you to check out the great work being done by organizations like <a href="https://www.worldrelief.org/"><strong>World Relief</strong></a> and <a href="https://wewelcomerefugees.com/"><strong>We Welcome Refugees</strong></a>. Talk to me after the service if you’d like more ideas and reading recommendations, by the way.</p>
<p>However, many Christians in this country are <strong>falling prey to the fear excuse</strong>.</p>
<p>We’re being tempted to turn away these vulnerable people because of the <strong>supposed risk of a terrorist attack</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong>I’m here this morning to plead with you: Do not fall prey to this nonsense.</strong> </u></strong></p>
<p>Even if the fear were <em><strong>legitimate</strong></em>, it is no <strong>excuse</strong> for Christians not to show concrete love to the powerless.</p>
<p>Whoever said that following Jesus would not involve any risks?</p>
<p>We dare not worship the <em><strong>American gods</strong></em> of <strong>comfort</strong> and <strong>security</strong> while neglecting to follow the True God’s commands.</p>
<p>However, <strong>these fears of refugees are VASTLY overblown.</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf">a September 2016 <strong>Policy Analysis</strong> from the <strong>CATO</strong> institute</a>,</p>
<ul>
<li>“the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a <strong>refugee</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>1 in 3.64 billion per year.”</strong></li>
<li>The chance of being murdered in a terrorist attack committed by an <strong>asylum-seeker is 1 in 2.73 billion per year.</strong></li>
<li>And “the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an <strong>illegal</strong> <strong>immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison: <a href="http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx">according to the National Safety Council</a>, <strong>your chance of dying from a lightning strike is 1 in 174,426</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong><u><strong>That means it’s about 20,868 times more likely that you will get killed by lightning than by a refugee terrorist attack.</strong></u></strong></em></p>
<p>While we’re worried about astronomical odds, these people are dying. The death toll from the Syrian conflict is approaching half a million, including 50 thousand children.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, please don’t mishear me. I’m not saying that the USA shouldn’t change anything about its policies. Surely there are many problems which need fixed.</p>
<p>However, I beg you: please do not fall prey to the fear-mongering. Please think and reason as <strong>Christians</strong> first.</p>
<p>After all, you can only give your “total allegiance” to one thing.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ will not settle for second place to the United States.</strong></p>
<p>So, stand up for the unborn and the refugees, not to mention the countless other marginalized, oppressed, and powerless people around us.</p>
<p>And I don’t even have time to get into how Christians should be concerned for religious liberties for all faiths. That’s a whole other sermon…</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But, if our Gospel is true, then we of all people should be willing to put our lives and our reputations at risk for the sake of others – especially for the poor and the needy.</strong></p>
<h2 id="closing-prayer">Closing Prayer</h2>
<p>So, again, God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would transform us from the inside out</p>
<ul>
<li>So that we would promote your <strong>justice</strong></li>
<li>So that we would embody your <strong>steadfast faithful love</strong></li>
<li>and so that we would <strong>humbly</strong> obey Your will,</li>
<li>even if it costs us our <em>reputations</em>,</li>
<li>and even if it costs us our <em>lives</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ask that this transformation would begin with me, and that it would extend to the ends of the earth. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

      <title>A Disappointing Christmas Homily</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/a-christmas-homily/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! And Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, let us pray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good morning! And Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>Together, let us pray:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. <strong><em>Amen</em>.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>You know, they say that Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. I’ve even heard it said that it’s the “hap-happiest season of all”!</p>
<p>But, can I take a poll real quick?</p>
<p>Please raise your hand if you’ve ever had a disappointing Christmas.</p>
<p>I mean a Christmas that didn’t live up to your expectations. You wanted it to be filled with love, happiness, and peace, and instead all you got was stress, anxiety, and loneliness.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-ever-had-a-disappointing-christmas">Have you ever had a disappointing Christmas?</h3>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>Now, why am I being such a downer? Isn’t this supposed to be a joyful occasion?</p>
<p>I mean, joy, triumph, and exultation practically drip out of every song we’ve sung and every passage we’ve read this morning! Why talk about the disappointments of Christmas?</p>
<p>Well, because we too often try to combat the disappointments of Christmas with shallow denial or escapism.</p>
<p>When things go wrong at Christmas,</p>
<ul>
<li>we tell the kids to shut up and turn the Christmas music up a little louder.</li>
<li>We throw money at our problems.</li>
<li>We withdraw into our shells,</li>
<li>and delude ourselves into thinking that next year will be different.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe, we’ve encountered so many disappointments, heartbreaks, and disasters in this world that we’ve given up hope completely.</p>
<p>We come to Church – perhaps just once a year, around Christmas – for the sake of relatives or nostalgia. But the story of Christ’s birth rings just as hollow as any other Christmas story.</p>
<p>I mean, can we really sing “Joy to the World” in Aleppo, Syria?</p>
<p>In South Sudan?</p>
<p>In Berlin?</p>
<p>In the intensive care unit?</p>
<p>In our own troubled homes?</p>
<p><strong>Yes, we can. In fact, we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span>.</strong></p>
<h3 id="we-must-sing-joy-to-the-world--even-through-tears--in-the-deepest-and-darkest-disappointments-of-this-world">We must sing Joy to the World – even through tears – in the deepest and darkest disappointments of this world.</h3>
<p>No matter how painful things get, we cannot celebrate Christmas by ignoring, denying, and detaching from the world around us.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because, although we live in a deeply disappointing world, we do not worship a disappointing God.</p>
<p>Although we frequently feel distant and detached from God and from one another, he is not distant or detached from us!</p>
<p>Instead, he has dwelt among us – as one of us! – in order to bring us back into perfect relationship with Him, with each other, and with all of creation.</p>
<p>Although we rebel against God, and run in the opposite direction – away from light and life into darkness and death – he does not abandon us. He does not keep us at arm’s length.</p>
<p>No, instead He dives from heaven’s heights into the muck and the mire of our sin- and death-stained world. He joins us in the thick of things, in order to bring us back to God.</p>
<h3 id="consider-the-disappointing-circumstances-of-his-birth">Consider the disappointing circumstances of his birth!</h3>
<p>We have thoroughly romanticized the nativity scene. Sure, there were glimpses of the extraordinary – such as the appearance of angels and the fact that Jesus was born to a virgin.</p>
<p>But when you consider that this is the arrival of the eternal and divine Son of God to the world he created, Christ’s birth is remarkably ordinary and humble – you may even call it disappointing, if you didn’t know any better.</p>
<p>It happened in a feeding trough, surrounded by animals and poor shepherds. He was born to poor parents, not yet fully wed! And this all took place in a tiny, po-dunk sheep town!</p>
<p><strong><em>This</em>?! <em>This</em> is Christ the King? Whom shepherds guard and angels sing?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This</em> is the eternal Son of God?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this baby in a feeding trough?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> is the heir of all things? The creator of heaven and earth?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this homeless itinerant preacher with a penchant for lepers, prostitutes, and tax-collectors?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact of imprint of his nature?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this criminal hanging on a bloodstained Roman cross?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> upholds the universe by the word of his power?</strong></p>
<h3 id="are-you-sure">Are you sure?!</h3>
<p>Because at his birth, throughout his life, and at his death, he is surrounded by the <strong>outcasts</strong> of this world! By the broken bits that the universe churns out!</p>
<p><strong>Are you sure this is God? Are you sure this is how he saves the world?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yes</strong></span>. Although, I do understand that this is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shocking</span>.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-is-shocking">Christmas is shocking.</h3>
<p>It’s either a shocking disappointment or a shocking hope.</p>
<p>As we read in Hebrews, <em><strong>in these last days, God has spoken to us through his Son, Jesus Christ.</strong></em></p>
<p>But what he has spoken can, at least for now, be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rejected</span> and ignored.</p>
<p>Consider again the words of John 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-would-we-reject-jesus">Why would we reject Jesus?</h3>
<p>Perhaps we’re not interested in such humble Savior. We’re interested in power, and we’re interested in staying in control.</p>
<p>We think that, despite life’s disappointments, we can fix this on our own. We can give our own lives some sense of meaning and purpose. We think we can save ourselves…</p>
<p>But <strong>we can’t save ourselves from Sin and Death</strong>. And it’s about time we admit that.</p>
<h3 id="thankfully-however-that-baby-born-in-bethlehem-can-save-us-all">Thankfully, however, that baby born in Bethlehem can save us all</h3>
<p>– even those at the <strong>bottom</strong> of this world – because he himself went to the bottom, to the outcasts, to the borders, and to the grave.</p>
<p>But he didn’t stay there!</p>
<p>He rose again victorious over the grave.</p>
<p>His death put Death itself to death.</p>
<p>And, as Hebrews 1 says, <strong>“After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.”</strong></p>
<p>And from there we await his <strong>return</strong>.</p>
<p>The Word who became flesh and made his dwelling among us will dwell with us once more, as Revelation 21 tells us.</p>
<p>He will wipe away every tear from our eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-be-a-part-of-this-hope">How can we be a part of this hope?</h3>
<p>Not by rejecting Jesus, but by receiving him. As John 1 continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have not yet <strong>received</strong> Jesus, entrusting your life to him as your Lord and Savior, then I beg you to <strong>do so</strong> this morning.</p>
<p>As we’ll sing in a bit, this is the meaning of Christmas! Christ was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>born that we no more may die, born to raise us from the earth, born to give us second birth!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now! He stands ready and willing to save you, to forgive you, and to welcome you into eternal life – if you will turn to him in <strong>repentance</strong> and <strong>faith</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s the response some of you are called to make this Christmas.</p>
<p>What about the rest of us?</p>
<h3 id="we-are-all-of-us-called-to-worship-the-god-who-has-dwelt-among-us-in-order-to-save-us">We are, all of us, called to worship the God who has dwelt among us in order to save us.</h3>
<p>We are, all of us, called to sing to the Lord a fresh, new song, for he has done marvelous things!</p>
<p>In the midst of the sorrows and disappointments of this world, with which our God is well-acquainted, we are, all of us, called to make a joyful noise to the Lord, to break forth into joyous songs and sing praises!</p>
<p>Amen?</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A chapel message in a Christian school.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you should know about me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a student at a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I went to a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; college.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I went to a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; high school, and a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; middle school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also: I’m &lt;strong&gt;the world’s worst sports fan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every week, they’re like, “Josh, did you see the game?!” “Josh, are you going to watch the game?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(A chapel message in a Christian school.)</em></p>
<p>There are a few things you should know about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a student at a <em>Christian</em> seminary.</li>
<li>Before that, I went to a <em>Christian</em> college.</li>
<li>Before that, I went to a <em>Christian</em> high school, and a <em>Christian</em> middle school.</li>
<li>Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a <em>Christian</em> home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, also: I’m <strong>the world’s worst sports fan</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every week, they’re like, “Josh, did you see the game?!” “Josh, are you going to watch the game?”</p>
<p>And I’m like, “Game? What game? I don’t even know which sport’s season it is!”</p>
<p>World’s. worst. sports fan. I’m telling you.</p>
<p>The one redeeming quality about my sports fandom is that I’ve stuck with one team through thick and thin: the University of Michigan Wolverines. Go Blue!</p>
<p>Now, I know that the rivalry between the Wolverines and the Ohio State Buckeyes is but a pale imitation of the rivalry between Alabama and Auburn down here. But up North, this rivalry was and is a big deal.</p>
<p>And it was really interesting, back when I was in middle school and high school, to observe what would happen each year in November when the Wolverines and the Buckeyes went at it.</p>
<p>I’m from Toledo, OH, which is on the border with Michigan, so the fan split was about 50/50 – Wolverines on one side, Buckeyes on the other.</p>
<p>And each year, on the day after the big game, you could tell who the true fans were…</p>
<p>It was the people still cheering for the team that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>lost</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>Why not the winning fans? Weren’t they just as legit?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. Perhaps they were legitimate, lifelong fans. But, on the other hand, they could just be cheering for the winning team because they won, right?</p>
<p>They could, in other words, just be <strong>bandwagon</strong> fans.</p>
<h2 id="bandwagon-fans-are-the-worst-right">Bandwagon fans are the worst. <em>Right</em>?</h2>
<p>I mean, you can’t trust them. Sure, they look like a die-hard fan now, when the team is doing well. But, when things get rough, when those wins stop coming, they disappear! On to the next team, at least as long as they keep on winning…</p>
<p>Bandwagon fans. <em>Those people</em> are the worst.</p>
<p>But, you know, if we’re honest with ourselves, <em><strong>we</strong></em> tend to ride a lot of bandwagons in life, and not just in sports.</p>
<p>We ride the bandwagon when it comes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>How we speak</li>
<li>What we wear</li>
<li>What we read</li>
<li>What we listen to</li>
<li>What we watch</li>
<li>What we eat and drink</li>
</ul>
<p>We ride bandwagons when it comes to our friends. Our hobbies.</p>
<p>And, if we’re really honest with ourselves, our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faith</span>.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-bandwagon-christians">We are Bandwagon Christians</h2>
<p>Hear me out. Hear me out. I’m not saying that there are no genuine followers of Jesus Christ here.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that, to some extent, being a Christian is built into the very fabric of our lives. I am, after all, speaking here at a Christian school, which meets in a church!</p>
<p>And me? I’m no better. I’m a student at a Christian school, and always have been! I’ve been around Christians my entire life!</p>
<p>Now, is being around Christians a bad thing? Should we all stop going to church?</p>
<p>No! That’s not what I’m saying.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that, if we’re not careful, following Jesus Christ will be just another thing we do to go with the flow, to follow the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Following Jesus will become just a matter of convenience, instead of devotion.</strong></p>
<p>And, just like any bandwagon fan, the danger for us bandwagon Christians is that, when things get tough, we’ll be exposed for who we really are – followers of ourselves, instead of followers of Jesus.</p>
<p>Friends, we’re all, to some extent, bandwagon Christians.</p>
<p>And here’s the bad news:</p>
<h2 id="jesus-doesnt-want-bandwagon-followers">Jesus Doesn’t Want Bandwagon Follower<strong>s!</strong></h2>
<p>Turn with me, if you’ve got your Bible, to Luke, chapter 14. Verse 25.</p>
<p>Now, for a bit of context, Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem. You know, where he’s about to be tortured and killed. And he’s got this big ol’ crowd of people with him.</p>
<p>I want you to imagine that we – all of us – are in that group of people, following Jesus.</p>
<p>And Jesus is about to drop a truth-bomb on all of us, that he is not interested in bandwagon followers. He doesn’t want them.</p>
<p>What does he want? Let’s read to find out. Verse 25 begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>25 </sup>Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them,<sup>26 </sup>“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="jesus-doesnt-want-bandwagon-followers-instead-he-wants-your-ultimate-loyalty">Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers. Instead, he wants your ultimate loyalty.</h3>
<p>See, he’s not urging us to get really angry at our family. And he’s not telling you to hate yourself or beat yourself up.</p>
<p>No, instead the word “hate” here emphasizes a <em>decision</em> to be made: <strong>who are you going to be loyal to, above all else?</strong></p>
<p>In that culture, your family was your source of identity. You were supposed to be loyal to them, no matter what.</p>
<p>Is Jesus saying that families are bad? No. Not at all.</p>
<p>But he is saying that, for his followers, he needs to be even more important to them than whatever else they give their loyalty to.</p>
<p>So, what is that for you and I, today? Is it your family? Or is it your friends? Is it your popularity, or the way you look? Is it your athletic or musical ability?</p>
<p><strong>Where do you find your identity? What gets your ultimate loyalty?</strong></p>
<p>Is it Jesus? Or is it ______?</p>
<p>Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers; he wants your <strong>ultimate loyalty</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="he-also-wants-your-life">He also wants your life.</h3>
<p>Let’s read verse 27:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>27 </sup>Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus is saying that his followers are to live as if they’re condemned to die. Pick up your electric chair and follow Jesus!</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds gruesome. But think about it. If you were really condemned to be executed soon, how would you live differently?</p>
<p>You see, death has a weird way of revealing what’s really important to us. If you knew you were going to die soon, would you spend your time chasing after status, money, or fame?</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>Jesus wants us to live differently than the world around us. He wants us to live in a way that screams to the world “There is more to life than being powerful! There is more to life than being popular! There is more to life than being pretty!”</p>
<p>And, if we live that way, we might suffer for it. We might lose friends, money, and influence. We might even get ourselves killed.</p>
<p>But Jesus wants our <strong>loyalty</strong>, and he wants our <strong>lives</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="ok-how-do-we-get-there">OK, how do we get there?</h2>
<h3 id="the-first-step-is-to-count-the-cost">The first step is to count the cost.</h3>
<p>Let’s read verses 28-32:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>28 </sup>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? <sup>29 </sup>Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, <sup>30 </sup>saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’</p>
<p><sup>31 </sup>Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? <sup>32 </sup>And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Jesus wants our loyalty and our lives, then it’s a good idea to stop and consider what we’re getting ourselves into before we claim to be his followers!</p>
<p>We need to count the cost, just like the tower-builder or the king going to war.</p>
<p>But, did you catch something else? We’re not just supposed to count the cost for no good reason. No! It’s supposed to teach us something.</p>
<h3 id="were-supposed-to-count-the-cost-and-to-realize-that-we-dont-have-what-it-takes">We’re supposed to count the cost, and to realize that we <em>don’t</em> have what it takes!</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Jesus says, we’re going to get embarrassed if we try and rush into things on our own. We don’t have what it takes.</p>
<p>What a motivational chapel message this is turning out to be! Hate your family and hate yourself, because you don’t have what it takes! Amen?!</p>
<p>Let’s read one more verse, verse 33:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>33 </sup>So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friends, it might not feel like it, but we’ve actually arrived at the good news. Remember, the bad news is that we’re all riding the bandwagon, and that Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-news-is-that-jesus-died-for-bandwagon-followers-like-you-and-me">The good news is that Jesus died for bandwagon followers, like you and me.</h2>
<p>Jesus rose again from the dead for bandwagon followers, like you and me.</p>
<p>And Jesus offers a new life to bandwagon followers, like you and me.</p>
<p>When our loyalty runs out, he remains faithful to us. When we fail, over and over again, to give our own lives meaning, he gives us the love, the purpose, and the meaning in life that we’re searching for.</p>
<p>When we come up short, Jesus carries us through.</p>
<p>Because no, we don’t have what it takes. But he does.</p>
<p>And he delights to give us what it takes to follow him into new, eternal life.</p>
<p>So, even though it’s incredibly hard to get off the bandwagon and pick up our cross, even though it’s really hard to give Jesus complete control over our lives, and to give him ultimate loyalty, above everything and everyone else, <strong>even though it’s the hardest, most difficult thing we will ever do,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Following Jesus is also the easiest, most joyful thing we will ever do.</strong></p>
<p>It’s easier than living life on the bandwagon. Why?</p>
<p>Because you don’t have to <strong>lie</strong> anymore, pretending you’re a follower of Jesus when really you’re the one calling the shots.</p>
<p>You don’t have to exhaust yourself trying to give your own life meaning. It doesn’t all depend on you and your effort and your strength and your skills…</p>
<p>NO, it depends on your Heavenly Father, who created you.</p>
<p>It depends on Jesus Christ, who died and rose again for you.</p>
<p>It depends on the Holy Spirit, who strengthens and empowers you to live life God’s way.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-does-jumping-off-the-bandwagon-to-follow-jesus-really-look-like">So, what does jumping off the bandwagon to follow Jesus really look like?</h2>
<p>Does it have to be this super-emotional, tear-filled conversion experience?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But I think that, for most of us, it’s going to look a lot more <strong>boring</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s why: we’re never going to <strong>become</strong> the people who pick up their crosses and renounce all they have, if we’re not becoming that kind of a person <strong>today</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, we need to pick up the little crosses each day. We need to say the small goodbyes to all we have each day.</p>
<p>What’s this look like? I think it looks like <strong>taking more risks for Jesus</strong>.</p>
<p>You know, it’s crazy. I think I’m more afraid of standing up to peer pressure than standing up to martyrdom!</p>
<p>It’s like, sure, I’ll take a bullet for you, Jesus. But please don’t make me call out my friend for that inappropriate joke,</p>
<p>Sure, I’ll go on that missions trip. But please don’t make me skip the game to go to church.</p>
<p>Sure, I’ll risk my life to spread the gospel. But please don’t make me risk my reputation by reaching out to that weirdo.</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our popularity?</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our athletic accomplishments?</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our everyday comfort?</p>
<h3 id="what-risk-is-jesus-asking-you-to-take-for-him-right-now-todayu-u">What risk is Jesus asking you to take for him right now, today?<u> </u></h3>
<p>Maybe it’s a conversation you need to have.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s an addiction or habit you need to break.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a fear you need to let go of.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s admitting that, although you really are a Christian, you’ve been riding the bandwagon, and you need to get off.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s admitting that, although you look like a Christian, you’ve only been riding the bandwagon, and you really aren’t following Jesus at all.</p>
<p>That’s a very difficult thing to admit.</p>
<p>But I promise you, you’re better off admitting it <strong>now</strong> than hiding it for years.</p>
<p>Jesus knows who you really are. Jesus knows who <strong>we</strong> really are, all of us.</p>
<p>He doesn’t want bandwagon followers. He doesn’t want people who think they have what it takes to give their lives meaning.</p>
<p>But Jesus is waiting with open arms to catch us, if we’re willing to jump off the bandwagon and follow him.</p>
<p>Are we willing to take the leap? To take the risk?</p>

      <title>The Feast of St. James the Apostle: A Homily for Ministers</title>

&lt;p&gt;Like so many other feast days – scheduled, as they are, on the days of the namesakes’ deaths – the feast day of St. James the Apostle is &lt;strong&gt;a strong rebuke to our aspirations&lt;/strong&gt;. To our aspirations as human beings, and especially to our aspirations as ministers of Christ’s Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, &lt;strong&gt;James started off as a mere fisherman&lt;/strong&gt;. An admirable one, to be sure, because he and his brother John answered Jesus’ call in Mark 1. They left behind their father, their family, and – they grew to hope! – their family’s fishing profession.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Like so many other feast days – scheduled, as they are, on the days of the namesakes’ deaths – the feast day of St. James the Apostle is <strong>a strong rebuke to our aspirations</strong>. To our aspirations as human beings, and especially to our aspirations as ministers of Christ’s Church.</p>
<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3910" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_3910" style="width: 247px">![Saint James the Greater *oil on canvas *92.1 x 74.9 cm *signed b.r.: Rembrandt f. 1661](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rembrandt_-_Sankt_Jakobus_der_Ältere-247x300.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3910">Saint James the Greater, by Rembrandt</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="james-amp-john-fishermen-no-more">James &amp; John: Fishermen No More?</h2>
<p>You see, <strong>James started off as a mere fisherman</strong>. An admirable one, to be sure, because he and his brother John answered Jesus’ call in Mark 1. They left behind their father, their family, and – they grew to hope! – their family’s fishing profession.</p>
<p>James was off on a new adventure, hopeful and headstrong. So much so that, along with his brother John, he earned the nickname “<strong>Son of Thunder</strong>”! Coming from the Son of Man, that’s no small compliment!</p>
<p>But their headstrong passion proved to be a <strong>weakness</strong> as well. In Luke 9, after getting rejected in Samaria, the Sons of Thunder offer to call fire down from heaven to consume the Samaritan village! This earns them a stern rebuke from Jesus.</p>
<p>And, even more famously, they approached Jesus with the following request in Mark 10:37:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="princes-or-fishermen">Princes? Or Fishermen?</h2>
<p>Now, their request is, in effect: <strong>“O King Jesus, would you please make us <span style="text-decoration: underline;">princes</span>?”</strong></p>
<p>And, granted, this is <em>Apocryphal</em>, but I imagine Jesus putting his arms around them and saying the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Princes? Princes?! Boys, if I had wanted princes, I would have called princes! But, I don’t need <strong>princes</strong>!</p>
<p>No, no, no. What I need are new <strong>fishermen</strong>! And that’s why I’ve called <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></strong>!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, <strong>James had been hoping for a new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">position</span>. And instead he received his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">old profession</span> – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">transformed</span>!</strong></p>
<h3 id="james-was-no-longer-to-be-a-mere-fisherman-but-a-fisher-of-men">James was no longer to be a mere fisherman, but a fisher of men.</h3>
<p>And not even just a fisher of men like Jeremiah 16 spoke of – for there the fishermen and hunters are instruments of judgment and exile.</p>
<p>No! Instead, James was to go fishing <em>with</em>, go fishing <em>for</em> Jesus, <strong>to bring people back from exile</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="now-undoubtedly-this-is-a-step-up-from-fishing-for-literal-fish">Now, undoubtedly, this is a step up from fishing for literal fish.</h3>
<p><em><strong>Or is it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Not necessarily. At least, not in the world’s eyes.</p>
<h2 id="the-death-of-st-james-the-apostle">The Death of St. James the Apostle</h2>
<p>Here’s Jesus’ actual answer to the “prince” request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”</p>
<p>And they said to him, “We are able.”</p>
<p>And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, granted, this isn’t one of the assigned lectionary passages for today, but I’d like us to look at the beginning of Acts 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He killed James the brother of John with the sword</span>, and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Swept aside, in just one verse!</strong> I doubt that sort of an abrupt, violent end awaited most of the fishermen working for Zebedee’s family business.</p>
<h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h2>
<p>Was it worth it? Did James receive any sort of a promotion, after all?</p>
<p>Of course, we know the <strong>right</strong> answer. But <strong>do we live it out?</strong></p>
<p>Are we thankful, are we satisfied with our roles as servants within Christ’s Church?</p>
<p>Are we willing to be “just” fishermen, even if it costs us our ambitions? Even if it costs us our lives?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Guido_Reni_-_Saint_James_the_Greater_-_Google_Art_Project-218x300.jpg" alt="Guido_Reni_-Saint_James_the_Greater-_Google_Art_Project"  />
By God’s grace, <strong>I hope so</strong>.</p>
<p>By God’s grace, may we – with the Apostle James – be able to confess the final words of Psalm 34 with open eyes, and open hearts. Perhaps it will help to imagine the following words on the dying Apostle’s lips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<br>
but the Lord delivers him out of them all.<br>
He keeps all his bones;<br>
not one of them is broken.<br>
Affliction will slay the wicked,<br>
and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.<br>
The Lord redeems the life of his servants;<br>
none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>

<p>What makes a great wedding?</p>
<p>Is it the fragrance and color of the flower arrangements? The particular grandeur of the venue?</p>
<p>Is it the number and camaraderie of the guests? Or the quality and sound of the music?</p>
<p>Is it the menu at the reception? Or perhaps the selection at the (hopefully open) bar?</p>
<p>I hope it’s not the quality of the sermon!</p>
<p>But, really, <strong>what makes a wedding great?</strong></p>
<p>Surely (gestures toward bride and groom) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">these two</span> have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Is it, perhaps, their physical appearance? His rugged handsomeness? Her stunning beauty?</p>
<p>What about their relationship? Is the wedding great because of the intensity of their love for one another? Their glorious dreams for the future? The optimism of this moment between them?</p>
<p><em><strong>What is it that makes a wedding great?</strong></em></p>
<p>I guess, if most of us had to pick, we’d say that a wedding is great <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if the bride is happy</span>. Right? I mean, even if the weather stinks, the singers are off-key, and the sermon is just absolutely awful – if the bride is happy, everything is OK. Right?</p>
<p>Which is a great reminder that <strong>weddings are about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people</span>, not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">performances</span>.</strong></p>
<p>However, I’m here today to tell you all that, sure, you can have a <em><strong>good</strong></em> wedding if the <em><strong>bride</strong></em> is happy.</p>
<p>But, <strong>if you want a really great wedding – if you want a really great marriage – then it’s really all about the <u>groom</u></strong>.</p>
<h4 id="ugreatu-weddings-might-i-even-say-heavenly-weddings-are-all-about-the-span-styletext-decoration-underlinegroomspan"><u>Great</u> weddings, might I even say <em>heavenly</em> weddings, are all about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>groom</strong></span>.</h4>
<p>Now, either you’re not listening or I’ve probably upset you!</p>
<p>Really? Has the preacher lost his mind? Is he some sort of chauvinist pig?</p>
<p>This is the bride’s big day! That’s why her outfit is more impressive! That’s why we all stand when the bride walks down the aisle!</p>
<p>Are we really going to take this moment away from her and say that it’s all about this handsome chump here?</p>
<p>Well, <strong>no.</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly weddings <em><strong>are</strong></em> all about the groom, but you (gestures to the groom) better <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>not</strong></em></span> use this sermon as an excuse for anything resembling male chauvinism!</p>
<p>Because, for one thing, I’m an egalitarian!</p>
<p>And, for another, I’m not talking about <strong>you</strong> (gestures to groom), <em><strong>her</strong></em> (to bride) bridegroom, but rather to <strong><u>Christ</u></strong>, <em><strong>our</strong></em> (gestures to everyone) bridegroom.</p>
<h4 id="great-weddings-and-great-marriages-are-all-about-christ-our-bridegroom"><strong>Great weddings, and great marriages, are all about Christ, our Bridegroom.</strong></h4>
<p>Take a glance at the Bible readings on your order of service everyone.</p>
<p>Did you catch the names on the wedding invite in Revelation 19? We’re not invited there to this wedding, of this woman to this man, but the wedding of the <strong>Church</strong> to <strong>Christ</strong> himself!</p>
<p>This is the same marriage Paul speaks of in Ephesians 5. In both passages, the Groom, Christ, takes center stage.</p>
<p>You see, in the ancient Jewish culture out of which the Bible came, weddings were done a bit differently.</p>
<p>Modern weddings often center around the arrival of the <strong>bride</strong> to her groom, but these ancient Jewish weddings really hinged on the arrival of the <strong>groom</strong> to his bride.</p>
<p>First, what would happen is the groom would pay the bride’s father her bride price.</p>
<p>After this, the couple was betrothed – legally joined together, although not physically, for they still were not fully married.</p>
<p>Instead, they went their separate ways. He went to prepare their future living quarters as an addition to his father’s household. She went back to her father’s household to prepare <strong>herself</strong> – including the preparation of her beautiful wedding dress.</p>
<p>After the groom had completed their home, he would gather his friends to go and get his bride. She and her companions would have a ballpark idea of when he would come, but the exact hour was a surprise. So, <strong>the bridal party had to stay ready.</strong></p>
<p>This is the scene we read in Matthew 25, where things went <strong>wrong</strong>. Five members of the bridal party were ready for the bridegroom to arrive, but the other five were not ready to join the evening’s lamp-lit procession.</p>
<p>Ideally, the bride and all her friends and family would be awake and ready to join the groom on the journey back to his father’s household and their new living quarters. Once there, the real party began!</p>
<p>Which, by the way, if things have sounded real intense up to this point, let me assure you: these people knew how to party! The wedding celebration would go on for days and days, launching the couple into their new life together.</p>
<p>Now, why in the world am I telling you all this? I mean, first I steal the bride’s thunder, and then I give you a Jewish history lesson?!</p>
<p>Here’s why (looks directly at bride and groom): <strong>your wedding, and your marriage to each other, finds its true meaning and glory as a part of Christ’s Bride – the Church – preparing herself for the Bridegroom’s return.</strong></p>
<h4 id="great-weddings-and-marriages-are-all-about-the-bridegroom"><em><strong>Great weddings and marriages are all about the Bridegroom.</strong></em></h4>
<p>What does that mean for you? Well, as we read in Ephesians 5, it means <strong>you are to love each other sacrificially and humbly</strong>.</p>
<p>After all, our Bridegroom died for us. He cleanses us from sin. And he sets us apart as his holy people. Will your marriage be an image of this kind of love for each other?</p>
<p>Look around the room, you two.</p>
<p>Now look at each other.</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say that you will each bring the other more <strong>joy</strong> than anyone else in this room. However, I think it’s also safe to say that you will cause each other more <strong>pain</strong> than anyone else in this room.</p>
<p>Because you are sinners.</p>
<p>You each, like us all, have fallen short of the glory of God. And marriage is about to make you especially aware of your spouse’s sinful flaws!</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, that’s not the end of the story. Thankfully, <strong>your marriage can point beyond itself</strong>, and therefore be truly <strong>heavenly</strong>.</p>
<p>For you both have been <strong>bought</strong> by the very blood of Christ – a steep bride price if there ever was one!</p>
<p>You have both been <strong>betrothed</strong> to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who is preparing a place for you both in his Father’s household.</p>
<p>And you are therefore both called to <strong>prepare</strong> your wedding garments through holy living – especially in how you <strong>love</strong> one another as husband as wife.</p>
<p>Should you love each other as Christ loves his Bride, your marriage will be a powerful witness – through both laughter and tears – to a world which desperately needs the Bridegroom. It desperately needs the Bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong, and to make everything <strong>new</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you know what that’s going to be like?</p>
<p>It’s going to be like <strong>a wedding banquet</strong>.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21(:2-4), John writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a <em><strong>bride</strong></em> beautifully dressed for her husband.</p>
<p>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.</p>
<p>‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we can anticipate that <strong>joy</strong> and <strong>celebration</strong> at the reception later today!</p>
<p>But we also get a glimpse of what’s coming when we partake of the <strong>Lord’s Supper</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as God has not left the two of your alone, but has blessed you with each other’s companionship, <strong>Jesus has not left his Church on her own</strong>, but promises to <strong>be with her</strong> in the breaking of the bread and the sharing of the wine.</p>
<p>Therefore, every time someone comes into contact with you as a Christ-centered couple, I pray they are reminded of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And every time the two of you, and all of you, partake of the Lord’s Supper, I pray you’ll remember that <strong>heavenly weddings, and the very best marriages, are all about the Bridegroom</strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-would-it-have-been-like-on-the-first-holy-saturday"><strong>What would it have been like, on the first Holy Saturday?</strong></h3>
<p>What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?</p>
<p>All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.</p>
<p>And so, some sorry snots get up to try and encourage us. They open up the Hebrew Scriptures and read about our great God.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, when He made the heavens, earth, and humans?</li>
<li>Remember, when He rescued Noah?</li>
<li>Remember, when he stayed Abraham’s knife-laden hand?</li>
<li>Remember, when he rescued us from Egypt?</li>
<li>Remember, when he promised to bring us back from exile, restore our fortunes, and open our… graves?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s too much, too soon. Shut up and sit down! Leave us mourn and weep awhile! Jesus is dead! The one we thought would save us is dead!</p>
<p>It’s been over a day. It’s been almost 2,000 years.</p>
<p><strong>Can these bones live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can these bones live?</strong></p>
<p>The question haunts us. The answer is so obviously “No! Of course not! They’re bones! No flesh, no breath, no life!”</p>
<p>And yet, God asks Ezekiel. And He asks us. Can these bones live?</p>
<p>And sure, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.</p>
<p>Can these bones live? Can <strong>Christ’s</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Surely this question must have flickered in someone’s mind on the first Holy Saturday. And, yes, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.</p>
<p>Look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">world</span>! Dealing in death, day by day. Wars. Famines. Floods. Diseases. Droughts. Death.</p>
<p>Can <strong>these</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Church</span>! Claiming with her lips to follow Jesus Christ, and yet so often proving with her life that she wants no such thing. Scandal. Hypocrisy. Idolatry.</p>
<p>Can <strong>these</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yourselves</span>! I’ll be honest, the question “can these bones live?” is put to every preacher facing a congregation! If the Spirit doesn’t move, I’m throwing hot air at dry bones!</p>
<p>Can <strong>your</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>But then, look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>! Just as scandalous, hypocritical, and idolatrous as any – and yet here I stand, presuming to proclaim the Word of God to you.</p>
<p>Who do I think I am? Can <strong>my</strong> bones live?</p>
<p><strong>Can all these dry, dead bones live?</strong></p>
<p>Friends, there’s a reason why we’re here, though it’s so dark, so late. Sure, it’s to bring in, bright and oh so early, the celebration of Easter.</p>
<p>But it’s also because <strong>keeping vigil is what the Church does every day</strong>. We keep vigil for the sake of a suffering and dying world. We keep watch for our bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong. We stay awake at the world’s late hour, surrounded by so many dry, dead bones.</p>
<p>Can these bones live?</p>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> They can. But, what do they need in order to do so?</p>
<p>First, they need some WATER. Did you notice how often water has appeared in tonight’s readings?</p>
<ul>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">creation</span>, out of which God called the dry ground – out of which He formed human beings.</li>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">judgment</span>, through which God saved Noah and his family in the Ark.</li>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">redemption</span>, through which God rescued Israel from the Egyptian house of slavery.</li>
<li>And the waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cleansing</span>, by which the Lord promised in the prophets to wash away His people’s guilty stains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Water, water, everywhere! Except the dry valley.</p>
<p>I think the dry bones need some sort of <strong>water</strong>.</p>
<p>They also need some sort of SPIRIT. You know, God’s Spirit, His breath, His wind, who hovered over the waters at creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who filled the first humans with life.</li>
<li>Who led God’s people.</li>
<li>Who inspired and preserved the words of Scripture we read this evening.</li>
<li>Who rushed upon the dry bones in Ezekiel’s vision – making them into a great army, alive!</li>
</ul>
<p>Dry bones need the <strong>Spirit</strong>.</p>
<p>But, the question isn’t “Can these bones get <strong>wet</strong> and <strong>windy</strong>?” It’s “Can they <strong>LIVE</strong>?!”</p>
<p>And, if they’re going to live, they’re going to need a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>RESURRECTION</strong></em></span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>They need the defeat of their most ancient enemy: Death!</li>
<li>They need Death’s reversal! They need Death’s death!</li>
<li>They need exactly what God promised Ezekiel: to open their graves, and lift them up, living!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amen! Glory, glory, hallelujah!</strong></p>
<p>But, if I hear Ezekiel’s glorious vision read at the first Holy Saturday, I’m tempted to <strong>lose it</strong> at this point. To bitterly ask those gathered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>When</strong>?! That sounds great, but <strong>when</strong>?! <strong>When</strong> is God going to do this?!</p>
<p>For over <strong>five hundred years</strong> since Ezekiel, we’ve been falling into our graves over and over again – and staying there! Sure, it’s no longer in Babylon, but we’ve been invaded and harassed and dominated here in Judah ever since!</p>
<p>Is it really that much better to fall into the grave under Rome’s heavy heel, like Jesus?</p>
<p>Why not Babylon’s?</p>
<p>Why not Assyria’s?</p>
<p>Heck, why not Pharaoh’s?</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> is God going to turn things around?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, I wasn’t in the audience back then. But we’re here, tonight. And maybe you’re similarly tempted to lose it and freak out sometimes in church!</p>
<p>All this pretty Jesus-talk, when for over 2,000 years the Church has travailed in the midst of a deadly and dying world.</p>
<p>We thank Jesus for our oversized meals, cars, and houses, while thousands fall into their graves around us – tired, hungry, destitute, and alone.</p>
<p>So, on the first Holy Saturday and the 2,000th, the question is roughly the same:</p>
<p><strong>When</strong>?! <strong>When</strong> is God going to turn things around?!</p>
<p>And the answer is likewise the same. We sang it, earlier:</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS THE NIGHT.</strong></p>
<p>When did God open the grave?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>THIS IS THE NIGHT</strong>, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <strong>can these bones live? Yes!</strong></p>
<p>Can <strong>Christ’s</strong> bones live? Yes! For on this night, some 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ got up from the tomb. He was alive. He was dead. But he is now alive again.</p>
<p>Can <strong>our</strong> bones live? Yes!</p>
<p>How? Because Christ has provided the <strong>resurrection</strong>, the <strong>Spirit</strong>, and the <strong>water</strong> we need.</p>
<p>Because, through the waters of <strong>baptism</strong>, we receive the Spirit and the resurrection.</p>
<p>Now, we aren’t going to baptize anyone tonight. We’ll have to wait until later this morning to do so. But we are about to renew our baptismal vows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>preserved</strong>, like Noah, from the waters of Sin and Death, in the Ark, the Church.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>ransomed</strong> and rescued, like Israel, through the waters of the Red Sea.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>cleansed</strong> with the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, as God promised through Isaiah and Ezekiel.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>buried</strong> with Christ in his death, and are <strong>raised</strong> with him in newness of life.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>empowered</strong> and <strong>emboldened</strong> to <strong>proclaim</strong> the good news to a desperate world that JESUS CHRIST IS RISEN.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we can assure the world that their bones can live, because <strong>Christ has died</strong>.</p>
<p>We can rest assured that our bones can live, because <strong>Christ is risen</strong>.</p>
<p>And we can keep watch for the sake of a suffering world, because <strong>Jesus Christ will come again</strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <title>Three Recent Sermons</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/three-recent-sermons/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a grueling past few weeks at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson&lt;/a&gt;. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can’t come quickly enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have preached twice in the past month on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032&#34;&gt;Psalm 32&lt;/a&gt;. First, I delivered a sermon (“The Refreshment of Forgiveness”) designed for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearC_RCL/Lent/CLent4_RCL.html&#34;&gt;Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C&lt;/a&gt;, for Dr. Doug Webster’s Preaching Practicum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a grueling past few weeks at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson</a>. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can’t come quickly enough!</p>
<p>Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!</p>
<p>I have preached twice in the past month on <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032">Psalm 32</a>. First, I delivered a sermon (“The Refreshment of Forgiveness”) designed for the <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearC_RCL/Lent/CLent4_RCL.html">Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C</a>, for Dr. Doug Webster’s Preaching Practicum.</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249090987″ params=”color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>
<p>Then, I preached/presented on the same passage for Dr. Allen Ross’s Exegesis of Psalms (“Psalm 32: Psalm 1 for Screw-Ups”).</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248878329″ params=”color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>
<p>Preparing and preaching these very <strong>different</strong> sermons on the <strong>same</strong> passage was a good reminder of the inexhaustible richness of Scripture.</p>
<p>Most recently, I got to compose a “crisis sermon” for Dr. Webster’s Preaching Practicum (“Lamenting into Worship”). One of my classmates preached a post-9/11 sermon. Another, post-Pearl Harbor! These were great sermons, but I chose a different route: <strong>preaching to a congregation after the death of a well-known church family’s baby</strong>.</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249874403″ params=”color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>
<p>This was a stretching experience, to say the least. I pray I never have to preach this sermon in real life, but it was a good reminder to preach the good news to myself that God hates death more than we do.</p>
<p>You can listen to and/or read “The Refreshment of Forgiveness,” “Psalm 1 for Screw-Ups,” and “Lamenting into Worship,” along with my other sermons <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/sermons/">at the <strong>Sermons Page</strong> of this site</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there are much better preachers out there in the world, so if you’re short on time, go listen to them preach! But, if you’ve got the time to give these sermons a listen, I would greatly appreciate your <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/contact/"><strong>feedback</strong> </a>as I try to improve as a preacher and teacher of God’s Word!</p>

      <title>Sermon: The Challenge of Christmas Light</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/sermon-the-challenge-of-christmas-light/</link>

<h1 id="i-introduction-the-prodigal-son-part-2">I. Introduction: The Prodigal Son, Part 2</h1>
<p>What a relief, to get out of that house.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey!</p>
<p>But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that <em>prodigal</em>) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.</p>
<p>So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.</p>
<p>But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.</p>
<p>“Dad has <em><u>changed</u></em>. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the <u>only</u> son. Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally <u>proud</u> of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.</p>
<p>And then Ethan threw it all away.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what, as it that weren’t bad enough, <u>dad</u> threw it all away…<u>for</u> Ethan.</p>
<p>He received much more love than I ever did.</p>
<p>I used to get punished for much slighter infractions than throwing my entire life (along with our hard-earned savings) away!</p>
<p>I never got a <em>banquet</em> when I broke Sabbath…I got a <em>beating</em>!”</p>
<p>At this point, Jude’s unpleasant thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the homestead on the horizon.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the amount of trash bags on the front porch.</p>
<p>Not much later, the smell hit him. Odors he’d only ever experienced in faraway marketplaces, and therefore that much more memorable.</p>
<p>Barely believing his eyes and his nose, Jude took a closer look at the trash.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grilled pork chop remnants.</li>
<li>Crusty booze bottles.</li>
<li>Bacon pizza fragments.</li>
<li>Ashen cigarette butts.</li>
<li>The slimy shells of shellfish.</li>
</ul>
<p>His blood pressure rising, Jude spit on the refuse-pile and stormed in the front door.</p>
<p>“Dad! Where are you!? He’s done it again! Brought his dirty Gentile friends into our home! Dad?!”</p>
<p>A very obviously hungover Ethan stumbled into the main room, nibbling on a piece of bacon. “Jude! You’re back…”</p>
<p>And Jude <strong><u>broke</u></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Ethan! You <em>ethnoi</em>, you <u>Gentiles</u>!</p>
<p>How can you continually scorn <u>our</u> father’s, <u>the</u> Father’s, <strong><u>righteousness</u></strong>!?</p>
<p>First, you go and throw away your life and our life-savings to <strong>run away with swine</strong>?!</p>
<p>Then, after the Father <em><strong>somehow</strong></em> took you in – adopted you like some bastard, orphaned children – <em><strong>you bring the swine back into this house?!</strong></em></p>
<p>You think you’re so <u>strong</u>, so <u>powerful</u>, but you’re <strong>weak</strong>!</p>
<p>You think you know <u>who the Father is</u>, <u>what he’s like</u>, but you’re <strong>wrong</strong>!</p>
<p>We’re <u>strong</u>! We’re the <u>firstborn sons</u> of God!</p>
<p><em><strong>Who in the hell do you Gentiles think you are?!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>If you really loved God, you would <u>follow</u> the Law and <u>keep</u> the traditions…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>How can the Father love you? It’s embarrassing, really.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We never should have allowed you back into this <u>house</u></strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now, Ethan was boiling over as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“Damn you, Jude! You Judaioi, you Jews!</strong></em></p>
<p>How can you continually forget <u>our</u> father, <u>the</u> Father’s <strong><u>grace</u></strong>?!</p>
<p>Don’t you realize by now that all your stupid <u>rituals</u>, all your hard <u>lessons</u> learned, were <strong><u>a complete waste of time</u></strong>!?</p>
<p>We Gentiles and God have moved on into the <strong><u>age of grace</u></strong>!</p>
<p>You Jews have FORGOTTEN the point of God’s grace, and so <u>He’s practically forgotten you</u>!</p>
<p>We’re the <u>firstborn</u>, <u>best-loved</u> sons now.</p>
<p>We’re the <u>strong</u> ones, and we <u>outnumber</u> you all at least three to one, so <strong>shut up and deal with it</strong>!</p>
<p>You’ve SCREWED UP so often, you got KICKED OUT of your land!</p>
<p>And you didn’t learn any lessons then, because you got yourselves THROWN OUT of Rome!</p>
<p><em><strong>How could Nero have let you back into this city? It’s shameful, really.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We never should have allowed you back into this Church, you…”</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]</p>
<p>Someone at the door.</p>
<p>The Roman Christians – Jew and Gentile alike – froze in fear.</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong> looked at the other <strong>Gentile leaders.</strong></p>
<p>Was it a centurion? Had their gathering been reported? Would they be asked to bow the knee, to offer a sacrifice, to the new emperor, Nero? If they weren’t willing to do so, would this be the end?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong> glanced at his wife, their children, and the other <strong>Jewish families.</strong></p>
<p>Had they already outstayed their recent welcome back to the city? After exile, they’d spent four hard, hard years rebuilding their life in Rome. Would they again be driven from their homes? Where would they go?</p>
<p>The <strong>slaves</strong> in the room – and there were <u>many</u> – anxiously retraced their steps throughout the day.</p>
<p>Which one of their fellow slaves had discovered their secret? Had followed them to this meeting? Had told their master? Would they merely get whipped again? Or had their master’s patience run out?</p>
<p>Jude whispered to Ethan, “You’re in charge here, get the door.”</p>
<p>He trudged to the threshold and pulled it open.</p>
<p>A hooded figure stepped through, walked to the middle of the room, and pulled the hood back.</p>
<p>Long brown hair flowed down.</p>
<p>The woman said <strong>“Christ is Risen!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“…He is…risen…indeed,”</strong> they all stammered in reply.</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“He is risen indeed. For twenty-five years now, in fact!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greetings. My name is Phoebe of Cenchreae.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rummaging in her pack, she began to explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I bring something for all of you from Paul, the apostle…</strong></p>
<p><strong>It’s in here, somewhere. Not this theology textbook. Not this to-do list…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ah! Here it is, a <u>letter</u>.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After carefully opening the document, she began to read the following words.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, her first audience didn’t have the benefit of reading these words off a page, but that’s no excuse for you not to follow along in your Bible, if you’ve got it with you.</p>
<p>Open up to Romans 1, and as I read these words, imagine Phoebe reading them for the first time to a room full of Roman Christians.</p>
<p>Reading these words like she was convinced they were absolutely true.</p>
<p>She began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ our Lord,<sup> </sup>through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles, among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called as saints:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God’s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you — that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.</strong></p>
<p><strong><sup> </sup>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, although that concludes the chunk of Romans we’ll consider today, Phoebe went on to read the rest of the <u>7,114 Greek words</u> in the letter.</p>
<p>And, as far as we know, as the one to deliver this letter, she would have also been its first <u>interpreter</u>. That is, she would have answered the <u>questions</u> of the first audience regarding what had been read.</p>
<p>Now, despite Paul’s wide influence in the early Church, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that at least one woefully-uninformed Christian at Rome would have raised his hand and asked: <strong>“Who is Paul?”</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>I mean, Who <u>was</u> Paul, really?</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="ii-from-paul">II. From Paul</h1>
<p>Well, as sister Phoebe mentioned, about <u>twenty-five years</u> separated the <u>Resurrection</u> of our Lord Jesus Christ and <u>Paul’s penning</u> of the letter to the Christians at Rome in 57, 58 AD.</p>
<p>If you wanted to find <strong>Paul</strong> in the <u>same year</u> that Jesus of Nazareth walked out of his grave, you might be a bit frustrated as you repeatedly flip through the “P” section of your Palestinian Phonebook. Because, see, <em><strong><u>Saul</u></strong></em>, of Tarsus, is your guy.</p>
<p>And, like some others whose names have changed, Paul had a <strong><u>past</u></strong>.</p>
<p>He’d <strong><u>done some things</u></strong>.</p>
<p>And I’m not going to spoil this with some alliterated list. I’ll let Paul tell you about his past:</p>
<p>In Acts 22:3-4, he says, if you’ll indulge the paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I’m a Jew. Sure, I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up right here in Jerusalem, educated in Dr. Gamaliel’s strict, strict seminary to learn and live the Law of Moses. I was just as zealous for God as any Jew. How zealous? I persecuted this Way, these Christians, to the death! I’d throw any of them I could, men or women, into prison!”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Acts 26:5b, 9-11, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I wasn’t just any zealous Jew, either. I was a Pharisee! […] I hated and opposed the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Jerusalem was my first Christian-hunting ground! I asked my superiors for permission, then threw those Christians in jail! And when it was time for their death-row judgment, I always cast a kill-vote. Just for fun, sometimes, I’d try to trip them up in synagogue – ask them just the right theological questions to get them to show their heretical cards. But deep down, I hated them. When they fled Jerusalem, I pursued them.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Galatians 1:13-14, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10px;line-height:10px;">“</span>You know what I did in my Jewish-only days, how I tried to wipe the church of God from the face of the earth. I was climbing the rungs of Judaism faster than anyone else my age. I was more zealous for the traditions than any of my old seminary buddies.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Philippians 3:5-6, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I was circumcised, I was as Hebrew as Hebrew could be; as to the law, a righteous Pharisee – no one followed it better!; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church;”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:13, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I once was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Jew.</li>
<li>A Pharisee.</li>
<li>A blasphemer.</li>
<li>A persecutor.</li>
<li>An insolent opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Such was Saul of Tarsus.</strong></em></p>
<p>And YET, here, Paul, to the Christians at Rome, declares himself, <u>first</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2 id="a-slave"><em><strong>A SLAVE.</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as previously, to his own <u>zeal for the traditions</u> and the so-called “righteousness” of the Law of Moses.</p>
<p>But a SLAVE of CHRIST JESUS. Taking orders from the one whose name he had <u>previously</u> and <u>viciously</u> endeavored to <u>oppose</u>!</p>
<p>Paul declares himself, second:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2 id="called"><em><strong>CALLED</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as he had previously supposed, to <u>persecute the Church</u>.</p>
<p>But to <u>plant churches</u>! To serve the church as an APOSTLE, as an ambassador, as an envoy – with a message from his master, Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>A slave. Called an apostle. Paul declares himself, third:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2 id="set-apart"><em><strong>SET APART</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as previously, for the sake of the Law as a Pharisee, which literally meant “one set apart.”</p>
<p>But set apart for the sake of the GOSPEL! The good news regarding his master!</p>
<p>Paul wants to <u>serve</u> the Church at Rome by <strong>preaching the gospel</strong> there, in order to <u>strengthen them spiritually</u>. This <u>letter</u> to the Romans will preach the gospel <u>in his stead</u> until he can do so <strong>face to face.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No longer a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But now a slave, an apostle, set apart for the gospel…Such was Paul!</strong></p>
<p>**Quite the transition! Don’t you think?**</p>
<p>It almost make us wonder:</p>
<p>“<strong>What could be <u>powerful</u> enough to <u>transform</u> someone like this?</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>What could be <u>powerful</u> enough to <u>transform</u> someone like this?</strong>”</p>
<p><u>But</u>…c’mon, we’re not studying Paul himself. We’re taking a look at <strong><u>Romans</u></strong>, remember? And, while no one would have asked sister Phoebe this question back then, we need to ask it today:</p>
<p><em><strong>**Who <u>were</u> the Romans? Who <u>were</u> these Christians at Rome?**</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="iii-to-the-roman-christians"><strong>III. To the Roman Christians</strong></h1>
<p>Well, like everyone, name-change or not, they had a <u>past</u>.</p>
<p>At <u>one</u> time – the Jews and the Gentiles alike – were both <strong><u>faithless</u></strong>. They were more or less <u>groping</u> along in the darkness until they came to know Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<p><u>Now, we don’t know much</u> about how Christianity first spread westward from Jerusalem to the center of the Roman Empire. However, it was <u>probably</u> taken there by Jewish Christians – perhaps by the Jewish “visitors from Rome” who, according to Acts 2:10, were present at Pentecost.</p>
<p>Regardless, those Christians present in Rome when Phoebe arrived were, in general, <strong>no longer <u>completely</u> faithless.</strong> After all, Jesus the Messiah had <u>enough</u> of a claim on their lives for them to risk attending <u>a potentially unpopular meeting</u>.</p>
<p>And yet, much like Saul had been <strong>ashamed</strong> of the <u>Jews</u> who had chosen to follow a <u>crucified Messiah</u> (…not to mention how much that Pharisee would have been ashamed of Gentile sinners!)…</p>
<p>Now, not just <u>annoyed</u>, or <u>irritated</u>. But ashamed. Embarrassed. Disgusted by the very existence of something, because it is humiliating.</p>
<p><u>Come on and feel</u> this for a second. We know what it’s like, <strong>to look in the mirror, to look back into our past, and feel gut-wrenching shame – at our high-handed sins, our careless words, our lies and our lusts. Because we’ve DONE some things. We have a PAST.</strong></p>
<p><em>**Shameful, really.**</em></p>
<p>Well…Much like the previous Paul, the Christians at Rome were <strong><u>ashamed</u></strong>.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, they were at least <u>tempted</u> to be ashamed of a <u>Savior</u> who didn’t exactly live up to the Roman ideals of <strong>power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>. This was real, this was raw. It may have been a bit <u>embarrassing</u> sometimes, to walk by the <u>huge buildings</u> and <u>striking soldiers</u> of the Empire to go and worship in secret a guy who had been</p>
<ul>
<li>mocked,</li>
<li>beaten,</li>
<li>stripped naked,</li>
<li>and nailed to a tree</li>
<li>until he died like a common criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ashamed, of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Second, they were ashamed of <strong><u>each other</u>.</strong></p>
<p>I hope my, admittedly apocryphal introduction gave you at least a <u>taste</u> of what it <u>could</u> have been like to be a Christian at Rome. Based on <u>historical evidence</u> and what Paul has to say at the <u>end</u> of this letter, we can surmise that the Roman church <u>shifted</u> from <u>predominantly <strong>Jewish</strong></u> to predominantly <strong>Gentile</strong>.</p>
<p><u>Positively</u>, this could have happened through <strong>new Gentile converts</strong>. <u>Negatively</u>, Emperor <strong>Claudius</strong> expelled the Jews from the city of Rome in <strong>AD 49</strong> due to a Jewish dispute about Christ. <strong>Acts 18:2</strong> mentions <strong>Priscilla</strong> and <strong>Aquila</strong> as two of the Jews thus exiled. With <u>most</u> of the Jews forced to leave the city, the churches would have become <strong>predominantly Gentile</strong>.</p>
<p>However, after Claudius’ death in <strong>AD 54</strong>, the Jews began to return to Rome under the new emperor, <strong>Nero</strong>. …To return to churches now <u>led by</u> and <u>populated with</u> <strong>Gentiles</strong> – Gentiles who no longer followed certain restrictions in the Mosaic Law.</p>
<p><strong>Jewish</strong> Christians were ashamed of their libertine <strong>Gentile</strong> brothers and sisters in Christ. How could these people so quickly forget the Jewish origins of their faith?</p>
<p><strong>Gentile</strong> Christians were ashamed of their <strong>Jewish</strong> brothers and sisters in Christ, because they were <em><strong>personae non gratae</strong></em> – <strong>unwelcome persons – to many Romans.</strong> They only <u>increased</u> the risk that the next knock on the door would be an unhappy centurion.</p>
<p><strong>Ashamed</strong> and <strong>divided</strong>. Such were <u>the Christians at Rome</u>.</p>
<p>And yet Paul writes to them, to <strong><u>call</u></strong> them – as <u>Christ</u> had called them – to something <em><strong><u>better</u></strong></em>. What was it?</p>
<p>The <strong><u>“obedience of faith”</u></strong> – and here <u>Paul’s</u> transformation links up with <u>theirs</u>.</p>
<p>Look at what he says in verse 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>through Christ <strong>“we have received grace and apostleship</strong> (Paul’s transformation) <strong>to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles</strong> (the Roman Christians’ transformation)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what does this <em><strong>obedience of faith</strong></em>, this <strong><u>obedient faithfulness</u></strong>, if you will, <strong>look like</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest with you, Paul doesn’t have <u>much</u> to say about this in these introductory paragraphs. <strong>He’s starting his audience off on a long trajectory</strong>, but he does <strong>return</strong> to the obedience of faith at the end of this letter! The exact phrase appears in the letter’s last sentence, in fact.</p>
<p>But the idea of obedient faithfulness appears a bit earlier.</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapters 1-3,</u></strong> we see what the <strong>opposite</strong> of obedient faithfulness looks like. At the end of chapter 3, we see what <strong>God’s saving faithfulness</strong> looks like (…It looks like Jesus!)</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapter 4</u></strong>, we see that obedient faithfulness still looked pretty similar in the Old Testament – with father <em><strong><u>Abraham</u></strong></em>, of whom it’s said in verses 20-21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in faith as he gave glory to God, (even before he was circumcised, mind you), fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>In chapters 5-8</u></strong>, we see various facets of God’s saving faithfulness as the foundation of our obedient faithfulness.</p>
<p><strong><u>In chapters 9-11</u></strong>, we are reminded that there is HOPE for obedient faithfulness among the Jewish people, because God remains utterly faithful to his promises.</p>
<p>And, I suggest to you that Paul refers to this <em><strong>obedient faithfulness</strong></em> in the well-known beginning of chapter 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your <u>spiritual worship</u>,”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or your “<em><strong>rational service</strong></em>,” or your “<em><strong>obedient faithfulness</strong></em>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <strong>the rest of</strong> <strong><u>chapter 12</u></strong>, we find out that obedient faithfulness looks like <strong><u>humility</u></strong> (12:3-8) and love (12:9-21).</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapter 13</u></strong>, we find out what <strong><u>humility</u></strong> and <strong><u>love</u></strong> look like when translated from another person to an impersonal government.</p>
<p>And then <strong><u>in chapters 14 and 15</u></strong> we get to the pastoral heart of Paul’s letter. The <strong>Christians at Rome were letting holy days and food laws come between them</strong>.</p>
<p>I find two verses of rebuke especially poignant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Romans 14:15 – <strong>“For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.”</strong></li>
<li>Romans 14:20 – <strong>“Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what I’m getting at: Paul calls the <u>ashamed</u> and <u>divided</u> Christians at Rome to the <strong><u>obedient faithfulness of UNITY</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Consider 15:5-7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,<sup> </sup>that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it: this is a far cry from Jude and Ethan’s passionate argument at the beginning! Again, we must ask:</p>
<p><em><strong>What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?</strong></em></p>
<p>The same thing that was powerful enough to change Saul to Paul: <em><strong><u>the gospel.</u></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><u>What is the gospel?</u></strong></em></p>
<h1 id="iv-through-the-gospel">IV. Through the Gospel</h1>
<p>Well, much like God’s people, including Paul and the Roman Christians, God’s gospel <strong><u>has a past</u></strong>.</p>
<p>See, it was once a <u>partial promise to the people of Israel</u>. Writing to his divided and divisive audience of Jew and Gentile Christians, Paul begins with the gospel’s Jewish roots:</p>
<p>Look at verses 2-3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God had promised the gospel <strong>“beforehand through his prophets in the holy [Hebrew] Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Jewish mission.</li>
<li>A Jewish hope.</li>
<li>A Son of David, in <u>human flesh.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>But how is this <u>powerful</u> enough to <strong>transform</strong>?</p>
<p>How does this <u>Jewish</u> mission have a claim on the faithful obedience of the <strong>Gentiles</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>**Because the Son of <u>David</u> is the Son of <u>God</u>.**</strong></p>
<p>The one <u>born</u>, and <u>crucified</u>, in the <u>weakness</u> of human flesh, is <strong>RAISED</strong> by the Holy Spirit in the <strong>power</strong> of <strong>resurrection</strong>! And this powerfully risen Messiah is the <strong><u>LORD</u></strong>. The <strong><u>Lord</u></strong> over more than Emperor Nero’s puny Roman playground. He is the Lord of heaven and earth! Of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p>You know, <u>merely</u> <u>crucified</u> Messiah is a <em><strong>poor</strong></em> Messiah indeed – worthy of <em><strong><u>shame</u></strong></em>. But a RISEN Messiah is a TRUE Messiah – worthy of <em><strong><u>obedience</u></strong></em> and <em><strong><u>faithfulness</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>Paul is therefore not ashamed of the gospel, because he recognizes its resurrection <strong>power</strong> – a power to <u>save</u> and <u>transform</u> <strong>ALL</strong> those who believe – both Jews and Gentiles who <u>trust</u> that <strong>Jesus Christ is who he says he is – the Son of God!</strong>,</p>
<p>Who <u>trust</u> that <strong>he has done what he set out to do –</strong> <strong>to <u>save</u> and to <u>redeem</u> through his life, death, resurrection and ascension.</strong></p>
<p>The gospel is therefore powerful enough to <u>save</u> and <u>transform</u> all those who <strong><u>trust</u></strong> that <strong>God is who he says he is</strong> – which is to say all those who <strong><u>believe</u></strong> that God himself is <strong><u>righteous</u></strong>.</p>
<p>He is <strong><u>faithful to keep his promises</u></strong> – his <strong><u>covenants</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to Adam,</li>
<li>to Noah,</li>
<li>to Abraham,</li>
<li>to Moses,</li>
<li>to David,</li>
<li>to Jeremiah,</li>
<li>and to all of creation –</li>
</ul>
<p>his <em><strong><u>promises</u></strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>to put the world back together again,</li>
<li>to not let Sin and Death have the final word,</li>
<li>but to <u>raise</u> his people from their graves,</li>
<li>to <u>melt</u> their hearts of stone,</li>
<li>to <u>breathe</u> breath, his <u>Spirit</u>, into their dry bones and lifeless flesh,</li>
<li>to bring the dead back to <u>life</u>,</li>
<li>to bring <u>US</u> back to life, read Romans 8!</li>
<li>to make the <u>faithless</u> ones <strong>faithful</strong>, to make <u>US</u> <strong>faithful</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>**God’s saving faithfulness to all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – through Jesus the Messiah calls forth, by the Holy Spirit, obedient faithfulness from all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – <u>to</u> Jesus the Messiah.**</strong></span></p>
<p>His <u>saving</u> faithfulness <strong>demands</strong> <u>obedient</u> faithfulness, and his Holy Spirit <strong>enables</strong> it.</p>
<p>God’s saving faithfulness <strong>demands</strong> and the Holy Spirit <strong>enables</strong> obedient faithfulness:</p>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as Paul says in 5:21,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as in 8:38,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“neither <u>death</u>, nor <u>life</u>, nor <u>angels</u>, nor <u>heavenly rulers</u>, nor things that are <u>present</u>, nor things to <u>come</u>, nor <u>powers</u>, nor <u>height</u>, nor <u>depth</u>, nor <u>anything</u> else in creation will be able to <u>separate</u> us from the <u>love</u> of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as in 15:5-6,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“the God of endurance and comfort [may] give you <u>unity</u> with one another in accordance with Christ Jesus, so that <u>together</u> you may with <u>one voice</u> glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="v-conclusion-obedient-faithfulness-today">V. Conclusion: Obedient Faithfulness Today?</h1>
<p>Now, I’m speaking to a room full of <em><strong><u>seminarians</u></strong></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We <strong><u>know</u></strong> that the gospel is <u>powerful</u> enough to conquer Sin and Death.</li>
<li>We <strong><u>believe</u></strong> that the blood of Jesus is a <u>powerful</u> enough <u>detergent</u> to <strong>wash away our guilty stains.</strong></li>
<li>We <strong>feel an adrenaline rush</strong> when we read Romans 8:38,
<ul>
<li>because we <strong><u>trust</u></strong> that NOTHING will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We <strong><u>know</u></strong> that’s why Romans is so stinking long, why Paul couldn’t just start with chapter 14…</li>
<li>Because <strong><u>we know</u></strong> that the only thing <u>powerful</u> enough
<ul>
<li>to <strong>unite</strong> divided and ashamed Jews and Gentiles is the <strong>gospel</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We <strong><u>have faith</u></strong> that the gospel is powerful enough
<ul>
<li>to transform Saul into Paul,</li>
<li>to unite Jews and Gentiles, to transcend their divisions!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>***BUT: Do we have faith that the gospel is powerful enough to transcend OUR divisions?**</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>…Is the gospel powerful enough to transcend our differences?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>…Is the gospel powerful enough:</strong></em></p>
<p>To unite liturgy-loving Anglicans with Bible-thumping Baptists?</p>
<p>To bring together, in LOVE:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contemporary and the traditional,</li>
<li>The “smells and bells” with the seeker-sensitive,</li>
<li>The 1928 Prayer Books with the 1979 Prayer Books,</li>
<li>with the “What’s a Prayer Book?”s</li>
<li>The Lutherans and the Reformed</li>
<li>The Democrats and the Republicans</li>
<li>The Calvinists and the Arminians</li>
<li>The Blacks and the Whites</li>
<li>The Piperites and the N.T. Wrightians</li>
<li>The Latinos and the Asians</li>
<li>The egalitarians and complementarians</li>
<li>The rich and the poor</li>
<li>The paedobaptists and the credobaptists?</li>
</ul>
<p>…the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>“Do not destroy someone for whom Christ died.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of _______,</strong></p>
<p><strong>be it your prayer-book preferences or your theological idiosyncrasies.”</strong></p>
<p>See, Paul <strong><u>could</u></strong> have attempted to <u>unify</u> the Roman Christians by <strong>turning their faith in on itself</strong>. By encouraging them to <u>admire</u>, as if in a mirror, the <em><strong>surprising fact that their diverse church existed in the center of a pagan empire!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><u>But he did NOT do that! </u></strong></em></p>
<p>Instead, he maintained that the <u>gospel</u> reveals God’s righteousness <em><strong><u>“from faith to faith”</u></strong></em> –</p>
<p><strong>FROM</strong> the Faithful God <strong>TO</strong> his <em>previously</em> <strong>faithless</strong>, but <em>potentially</em> <strong>faithful</strong> and <strong>unified</strong>, people! <strong>FROM GOD TO US</strong></p>
<p>That <strong><u>order</u></strong> is important! <u>Because it will not do</u> to engage in <em><strong>ecclesiastical navel-gazing!</strong></em> We can’t just look at <u>ourselves</u> and marvel at the fact that <em><strong>our diverse seminary exists in the center of a pagan empire!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><u>No! We must look to Christ!</u></strong> For he himself is our <strong><u>peace</u></strong>, first with <u>God</u> and then with <u>one</u> <u>another</u>!</p>
<p>If we look at <u>one another</u>, before looking at <u>Christ</u>, and try to transcend our differences <u>on our own</u>, then <em><strong>we will inevitably become <u>ashamed</u> of one another</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em>Ashamed.</em></p>
<p><em>I can’t believe that God let some of y’all into his Church!</em></p>
<p>I’m embarrassed and frustrated by some of you. Sure, on my better days, I’ll admit you’re my brothers and sisters. But most days, we don’t feel much like siblings. Or maybe, we feel a bit TOO MUCH like human siblings, <u>bickering</u> and <u>nagging</u> and <u>fighting</u>.</p>
<p>And sure, I know I embarrass and frustrate some of you. And if that doesn’t apply to you <u>yet</u>, just <strong><u>wait</u></strong>! I’ll get there.</p>
<p>Friends, Sisters, Brothers, If we are <u>on our own</u> in this crazy thing called <strong>Church</strong>, it’s a hopeless, frustrating <em><strong><u>mess</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>But <u>if we trust that Paul knew what he was doing</u> when he began with the <strong>GOSPEL</strong> in this <u>lengthy pastoral letter to a <strong>divided</strong> church</u>,</p>
<p>If <u>we look to Christ Jesus</u> and <strong>trust</strong> that the gospel is <strong><u>powerful</u></strong> enough, not just to save, transform, and unify <em><strong>them</strong></em>, back <em><strong>then</strong></em>… but <strong>US, RIGHT NOW…</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>If we look to Christ and trust: </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Then,</u></strong> TOGETHER we <strong>“may with <u>one</u> voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Then,</u></strong> TOGETHER we may <strong>“<u>receive</u> one another, just as Christ also received [us], to God’s glory.”</strong></p>
<p>Then, TOGETHER we may <u>sing</u> and <u>believe</u> the words of the following hymn:</p>
<p>You’ve got a handout with the words. Would you stand and sing it with me?</p>
<p><strong>The Church’s one foundation<br>
Is Jesus Christ her Lord,<br>
She is His new creation<br>
By water and the Word.<br>
From heaven He came and sought her<br>
To be His holy bride;<br>
With His own blood He bought her<br>
And for her life He died.</strong></p>
<p><strong>She is from every nation,<br>
Yet one o’er all the earth;<br>
Her charter of salvation,<br>
One Lord, one faith, one birth;<br>
One holy Name she blesses,<br>
Partakes one holy food,<br>
And to one hope she presses,<br>
With every grace endued.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Though with a scornful wonder<br>
Men see her sore oppressed,<br>
By schisms rent asunder,<br>
By heresies distressed:<br>
Yet saints their watch are keeping,<br>
Their cry goes up, “How long?”<br>
And soon the night of weeping<br>
Shall be the morn of song!</strong></p>
<p><strong>’Mid toil and tribulation,<br>
And tumult of her war,<br>
She waits the consummation<br>
Of peace forevermore;<br>
Till, with the vision glorious,<br>
Her longing eyes are blest,<br>
And the great Church victorious<br>
Shall be the Church at rest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

      <title>The Prodigal Son, Part 2: Introduction to Romans</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;relief&lt;/span&gt;, to get out of that house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey! But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand. But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">relief</span>, to get out of that house.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey! But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.</p>
<p>So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand. But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.</p>
<p>“Dad has <em><strong>changed</strong></em>. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span> son.</p>
<p>Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally <span style="text-decoration:underline;">proud</span> of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.</p>
<p>And then Ethan threw it all away.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what, as it that weren’t bad enough, dad threw it all away…<span style="text-decoration:underline;">for</span> Ethan!</p>
<p>He received <span style="text-decoration:underline;">much</span> more love than I ever did. I used to get punished for much slighter infractions than throwing my entire life (along with our hard-earned savings) away! I never got a <em>banquet</em> when I broke Sabbath…I got a <em>beating</em>!”</p>
<p>At this point, Jude’s unpleasant thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the homestead on the horizon.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the amount of trash bags on the front porch. Not much later, the smell hit him. Odors he’d only ever experienced in faraway marketplaces, and therefore that much more memorable.</p>
<p>Barely believing his eyes and his nose, Jude took a closer look at the trash.</p>
<p>Grilled pork chop remnants.</p>
<p>Crusty booze bottles.</p>
<p>Bacon pizza fragments.</p>
<p>Ashen cigarette butts.</p>
<p>The slimy shells of shellfish.</p>
<p>His blood pressure rising, Jude spit on the refuse-pile and stormed in the front door.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Dad! Where are you!? He’s done it again! Brought his dirty Gentile friends into our home! Dad?!”</strong></em></p>
<p>A very obviously hungover Ethan stumbled into the main room, nibbling on a piece of bacon. <em><strong>“Jude! You’re back…”</strong></em></p>
<p>And Jude <span style="text-decoration:underline;">broke</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Ethan! You <em>ethnoi</em>, you Gentiles! How can you continually scorn our father’s, the Father’s, righteousness!?</p>
<p>First, you go and throw away your life and our life-savings to run away with swine?! Then, after the Father somehow took you in – adopted you like some bastard, orphaned children – you bring the swine back into this house?!</p>
<p>You think you’re so strong, so powerful, but you’re <strong>weak</strong>! You think you know who the Father is, what he’s like, but you’re <strong>wrong</strong>!</p>
<p>We’re strong! We’re the firstborn sons of God! Who in the hell do you Gentiles think you are?!</p>
<p>If you really loved God, you would follow the Law and keep the traditions…</p>
<p>How can the Father love you people? It’s embarrassing, really.</p>
<p>We never should have allowed you back into this house.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now, Ethan was boiling over as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Jude! You <em>judaioi</em>, you Jews!</p>
<p>How can you continually forget our father, the Father’s grace?!</p>
<p>Don’t you realize by now that all your stupid rituals, all your hard lessons learned, were a complete waste of time!? We Gentiles and God have moved on into the age of grace!</p>
<p>You Jews have forgotten the point of God’s grace, and so He’s practically forgotten you! We’re the firstborn, best-loved sons now. We’re the strong ones, and we outnumber you all at least three to one, so shut up and deal with it!</p>
<p>You’ve screwed up so often, you got kicked out of your land! And you didn’t learn any lessons then, because you got yourselves thrown out of Rome!</p>
<p>How could Nero have let you people back into this city? It’s shameful, really.</p>
<p>We never should have allowed you back into this Church, you…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]</p>
<p>Someone at the door.</p>
<p>The Roman Christians – Jew and Gentile alike – froze in fear.</p>
<p>Ethan looked at the other Gentile leaders.</p>
<p>Was it a centurion? Had their gathering been reported? Would they be asked to bow the knee, to offer a sacrifice, to the new emperor, Nero? If they weren’t willing to do so, would this be the end?</p>
<p>Jude glanced at his wife, their children, and the other Jewish families.</p>
<p>Had they already outstayed their recent welcome back to the city? After exile, they’d spent four hard, hard years rebuilding their life in Rome. Would they again be driven from their homes? Where would they go?</p>
<p>The slaves in the room – and there were many – anxiously retraced their steps throughout the day.</p>
<p>Which one of their fellow slaves had discovered their secret? Had followed them to this meeting? Had told their master? Would they merely get whipped again? Or had their master’s patience run out?</p>
<p>Jude whispered to Ethan, “You’re in charge here, get the door.”</p>
<p>He trudged to the threshold and pulled it open.</p>
<p>A hooded figure stepped through, walked to the middle of the room, and pulled the hood back. Long brown hair flowed down.</p>
<p>The woman said “Christ is Risen!”</p>
<p>“…He is…risen…indeed,” they all stammered in reply.</p>
<p>She smiled: “He is risen indeed. For twenty-five years now, in fact! Greetings. My name is Phoebe of Cenchreae.”</p>
<p>Rummaging in her pack, she began to explain:</p>
<p>“I bring something for all of you from Paul, the apostle… It’s in here, somewhere. No, not this theology textbook. No, not this to-do list… Ah! Here it is, a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>letter</strong></span>.”</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A homily on Mark 8:11-21 (ESV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-11&#34;&gt;The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-12&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24508&#34;&gt;And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, &lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;“Why does this generation seek a sign?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-14&#34;&gt;Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-15&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24511&#34;&gt;And he cautioned them, saying, &lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;“Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-16&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24512&#34;&gt;And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-17&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24513&#34;&gt;And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, &lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;“Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread?

<p><a href="http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1974feb23-00025">In an interview, published in 1974</a>, with famed thinker Bertrand Russell, Leo Rosten asked Russell the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let us suppose, sir, that after you have left this sorry vale, you actually found yourself in heaven, standing before the Throne. There, in all his glory, sat the Lord—not Lord Russell, sir: God.”</p>
<p>Russell winced.</p>
<p>“What would you think?”</p>
<p>“I would think I was dreaming.”</p>
<p>“But suppose you realized you were not? Suppose that there, before your very eyes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, was God. What would you say?”</p>
<p>The pixie wrinkled his nose. “I probably would ask, ‘Sir, why did you not give me better evidence?’ “</p>

<p>In Numbers 14:11, YHWH says to Moses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we return to consider our passage from Mark 8, keep in mind that in the region of Tyre, Jesus has just performed a long-distance exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman’s daughter (7:24-30). He has just healed a deaf mute in the region of the Decapolis (7:31-37). He has just fed at least four thousand people with just seven loaves of bread in a desolate place (8:1-10).</p>
<p>And yet, in the region of Dalmanutha, the Pharisees have the audacity to <em><strong>demand a sign</strong></em> from heaven, to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>test</strong></span> Jesus in a manner not unlike the Adversary tested him in the wilderness (Mark 1:13).</p>
<p>Why does this demand <span style="text-decoration:underline;">exasperate</span> Jesus? Surely, given his recent actions, he is not averse to the supernatural in-breaking of God’s kingdom as demonstrated in his miracles. Instead, he astutely recognizes <strong>the incompatibility of this sign-seeking pharisaical power-play with true trust, true faith.</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.catholiccommentaryonsacredscripture.com/volumes-authors/mary-healy/">Catholic scholar Mary Healy </a>rightfully observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“to insist on irrefutable evidence is really a demand for control, as if to say ‘Force us to believe, so that we will not have to trust you or change our hearts.’ But faith that is compelled is not faith at all” (<em>The Gospel of Mark</em>, 153).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am here reminded of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the twin-error of fundamentalism and liberalism</span> when it comes to biblical and theological studies: the insistence that <strong>we will only believe what is scientifically verifiable according to the standards we have inherited from Enlightenment Rationalism</strong>. The former group thinks <span style="text-decoration:underline;">everything</span> can be verified, the latter group, very <span style="text-decoration:underline;">little</span>.</p>
<p>Sure, OK, but <u>we’re</u> not fundamentalists or liberals, at least not on our <em>good</em> days. But, following the example of the disciples in the second half of our passage, <em>don’t we often pine for various other kinds of bread while we misunderstand and ignore the true bread of heaven among us</em>?</p>
<p>Will we be satisfied by God’s faithful provision of Word and Sacrament to nourish our faith? Or will we long for the more extraordinary manifestations? (As if Word &amp; Sacrament were ordinary!)</p>
<p>Now, can we, should we long for miracles, for healing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can God, will God continue to work wonders, heal sickness, and reverse death in our midst?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But we must be constantly <em><strong>vigilant</strong></em>, first, that we do not begin to value the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">healing</span> more than the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Healer</span>, the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">wonders</span> more than the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">One who works them</span>.</p>
<p>And, second, that we do not, like the Pharisees (and even the disciples, for a time!), close our eyes, ears, and hearts to the miraculous things that God, in Christ, is <em><strong>already</strong></em> and <em><strong>always</strong></em> doing.</p>
<p>Whether we can discern it or not, <strong>God is making the world right again. He will not be thwarted in this mission</strong>.</p>
<p>Friends, God knows that we need some sort of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sign</span>, that we cannot keep the faith on our own, unaided. So he has given us sign-seekers His very <span style="text-decoration:underline;">self</span>, His very <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Son</span>!</p>
<p>He will not bow down to our demands for <em>verification</em>, but he will graciously meet our every need. He will give us enough to trust him along the road to cosmic redemption, even when that road passes through the deepest, darkest valley of doubt.</p>
<p>So, as we rightfully pray that God’s Kingdom would come, that His will might be done, let us pray to be satisfied in our King, in God’s Son.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A homily on Mark 1:29-45 (ESV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-29&#34;&gt;And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-30&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24242&#34;&gt;Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-31&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24243&#34;&gt;And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homily on Mark 1:29-45 (ESV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Mark-1-29">And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-30" id="en-ESV-24242">Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-31" id="en-ESV-24243">And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Mark-1-32" id="en-ESV-24244">That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-33" id="en-ESV-24245">And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-34" id="en-ESV-24246">And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Mark-1-35">And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-36" id="en-ESV-24248">And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,</span> <span class="text Mark-1-37" id="en-ESV-24249">and they found him and said to him,“Everyone is looking for you.”</span> <span class="text Mark-1-38" id="en-ESV-24250">And he said to them, <span class="woj">“Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.”</span></span> <span class="text Mark-1-39" id="en-ESV-24251">And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Mark-1-40">And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, “If you will, you can make me clean.”</span> <span class="text Mark-1-41" id="en-ESV-24253">Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, <span class="woj">“I will; be clean.”</span></span> <span class="text Mark-1-42" id="en-ESV-24254">And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-43" id="en-ESV-24255">And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once,</span> <span class="text Mark-1-44" id="en-ESV-24256">and said to him, <span class="woj">“See that you say nothing to anyone, but go,show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.”</span></span> <span class="text Mark-1-45" id="en-ESV-24257">But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today’s Gospel lesson consists of at least three distinct episodes.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Mark 1:29-34, Jesus heals Peter’s mother-in-law before a night-long, town-wide round of healings and exorcisms.</li>
<li>Then, in Mark 1:35-39, Jesus absconds to a desolate place in the early morning hours to pray. When Peter and the others find him, he reaffirms the preaching focus of his ministry, before taking the disciples along with him as he proclaims the kingdom in Galilee, and demonstrates the kingdom by casting out demons.</li>
<li>Finally, in Mark 1:40-45, a leper courageously and somewhat scandalously approaches Jesus, asking to be made clean. Jesus, moved with compassion, grants his request, makes him clean, charges him with silence, and – partially because the request for silence went unheeded – is forced to remain in desolate places to avoid the growing attention his ministry is receiving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, what to make of these things? As ministers within the Church, as followers of Jesus, I think we naturally (and rightly) tend to place ourselves in the place of Christ’s <em><strong>disciples</strong></em> when we work our way through Gospel texts.</p>
<p>However, with today’s episodes, I’d like us to consider what we can learn about our vocations from <strong>Peter’s mother-in-law</strong>, from <strong>Jesus himself</strong>, and from the <strong>leper</strong>. These, I believe, demonstrate the importance of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">service</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">prayer</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">proclamation</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">worship</span></p>
<p>First, as with several of Jesus’ miraculous healings, Peter’s mother-in-law is raised from her bed as a <em>foreshadowing of Christ’s resurrection</em>. And although the use of the verb <em>diakoneo</em> to mean “to serve, to wait upon,” is perfectly within the term’s semantic range, we should not fail to notice that the woman provides an apt example of the Christian life: just as she was raised from her bed and began to serve Christ and the disciples, we are raised from our sickness of Sin and Death for a purpose, unto a life of <em><strong>service</strong></em> within Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>Secondly, after an eventful night of healings and casting out demons, Jesus demonstrates for us the sustaining importance of <em><strong>prayer</strong></em>, even and especially in the lives of ministry big shots, by retreating to a deserted place in the early morning hours to pray to the Father. This lifestyle of prayer is what sustains his healing ministry, and also, thirdly, it sustains his <em><strong>preaching</strong></em> ministry.</p>
<p>Jesus does not lose focus in the midst of growing crowds. He takes time to be alone, to pray – and he relentlessly proclaims the coming Kingdom of God to the people. May we strike the same balance as our Lord in our ministries today.</p>
<p>Service. Prayer. Proclamation. And finally, <em><strong>Worship</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Notice the leper, condemned to a life of painful illness and perhaps even more painful social exclusion. Taking the risk that Jesus might recoil in horror at his presence, like countless others would have, the leper boldly asks, notice, not primarily for physical healing, but for <em>restoration to the worshiping community</em>!</p>
<p>We must keep the biblical, and not the clinical, meaning of “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">clean</span>” in mind here: <em><strong>acceptable and ready to worship the living God</strong></em>! Jesus reverses the normal contagion movement, transferring his cleanliness to the unclean man, restoring the leper to a life of worship. A beautiful exchange, one which Christ is still willing to make with us today! <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>However, are we as eager as the leper to be healed in order to worship God? To serve God? To pray to God? To proclaim God’s Kingdom?</strong></span></p>
<p>Let us not make healing a <em>self-centered</em> occurrence. Christ offers us healing and restoration for this fourfold purpose: <strong>service</strong>, <strong>prayer</strong>, <strong>proclamation</strong>, and <strong>worship</strong>.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A homily on James 2.1-13 (ESV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-1&#34;&gt;“My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,the Lord of glory.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-2&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30279&#34;&gt;For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-3&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30280&#34;&gt;and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-4&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30281&#34;&gt;have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-5&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30282&#34;&gt;Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-6&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30283&#34;&gt;But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-7&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30284&#34;&gt;Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homily on James 2.1-13 (ESV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Jas-2-1">“My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,the Lord of glory.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-2" id="en-ESV-30279">For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,</span> <span class="text Jas-2-3" id="en-ESV-30280">and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”</span> <span class="text Jas-2-4" id="en-ESV-30281">have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-5" id="en-ESV-30282">Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-6" id="en-ESV-30283">But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-7" id="en-ESV-30284">Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?</span></p>
<p><span class="text Jas-2-8" id="en-ESV-30285">“If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-9" id="en-ESV-30286">But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-10" id="en-ESV-30287">For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.</span><span class="text Jas-2-11" id="en-ESV-30288">For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-12" id="en-ESV-30289">So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-13" id="en-ESV-30290">For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse immediately preceding this morning’s lesson, James 1:27, says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em><strong>religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world</strong></em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">purity from the world</span></em> on one hand, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>social justice for the oppressed</em></span> on the other. And yet, in a world which is stained by rampant injustice, <strong>these are not two different pursuits, but different facets of the same agenda</strong>. Just as we must not allow the manifold sins of the world to stain our souls, we must take care to not allow the deathly and selfish perspectives of the world to stain our vision!</p>
<p>The world says that this [slaps Bible] is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just a book</span>. We <strong>disagree</strong>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The world says that this [slaps altar] is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just a table</span>. Just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bread</span>. Just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">wine</span>. We <strong>disagree</strong>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>.</p>
<p>This [gestures to room] is <strong>more</strong> than mere <span style="text-decoration:underline;">meditation</span>. Our God is <strong>more</strong> than a divinized <span style="text-decoration:underline;">delusion</span>.</p>
<p><strong>We have wiped the world’s mud out of our eyes, to see more clearly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Very good!</strong></p>
<p>The world says that a poor, homeless, drug-addled woman is a broken human being. We <strong>agree</strong>.</p>
<p>The world says that a rich, well-dressed, influential man is a less-broken human being, or at least broken in a more comfortable way.</p>
<p>We <strong>agree</strong>. Or at least we’re constantly tempted to in the everyday moments of our lives! Sure, theoretically, in the midst of a homily perhaps, we’d give the right answer. But practically, brothers and sisters, we’re <em><strong>partial</strong></em>. Our vision is still <em><strong>stained</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We’ve been wooed by the world’s wisdom.</p>
<p>We allow the stratified contents and contours of the world <span style="text-decoration:underline;">around</span> us to dictate the distinctions <span style="text-decoration:underline;">among</span> us.</p>
<p>We make evil judgments – very subtle, to be sure, but just so, that much more evil judgments! – based on the way things <em><u>are</u></em>.</p>
<p>We are naïve newcomers to the law of liberty – to the law which gives freedom <em><strong>from</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are</span>, <em><strong>from</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">have been</span> as long as we can remember, and freedom <em><strong>for</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">once were</span>, in a garden unstained by Sin and Death. A freedom <em><strong>for</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ought to be</span>, and will be in a city illuminated by Christ himself.</p>
<p>Christ himself, the One of whom Isaiah spoke thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear, but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth</span>; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins”</strong></em> (Isaiah 11:1-5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friends, the rich are not inherently evil because of their possessions. We know this. They, <strong>we</strong>, have their own pains and problems, which we will need to address thoughtfully as a church providentially located in one of the world’s most affluent communities – and <strong>this is no easy task</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>But</strong></em></span> it would be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">easy</span> for us to allow the stratified realities around us to stain our vision, to keep us short-sighted, to keep us complacent that <strong>it would be just as unusual for the homeless and shabbily-clothed to join <span style="text-decoration:underline;">our</span> community</strong> (really <span style="text-decoration:underline;">join</span> us, not just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">visit</span>), <strong>as it would be for the rich and well-dressed to have joined the earliest Christians, or many of our impoverished brothers and sisters around the world today</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us fight hard against this subtle temptation.</p>
<p>Let us consider how we should best love and welcome those the world <span style="text-decoration:underline;">calls</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">treats</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sees</span> as “<em><strong>the least</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Let us <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>disagree</strong></span>! And <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>!</p>
<p>Let us treat them as “<em><strong>the loved</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

(I began with a bit of a mic issue. Ignore the garbled first 10 seconds or so!)</strong></p>
<p>—</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The “hometown,” “home court” advantage is a very real occurrence in many areas of life. Familiar fans and supportive surroundings help us humans to perform better at many tasks, from singing to sports.</p>
<p><em><strong>But not in sermons.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is very seldom a home court advantage in preaching!</p>
<p>Family and close friends may inspire us to make the game-winning shot, or hit the highest note, but when it comes to the intimate affair of preaching God’s Word — of transcending the divide between <em>there &amp; then</em> and <em>here &amp; now</em>, making it clear how the words of Scripture should enlighten, encourage, confront, and challenge us — when it comes to preaching to family and friends, it’s <em><strong>hard</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Granted, it might be easier to impress, to invigorate, to lay on the rhetorical relish with grandiose gestures, dazzling diction, and absolutely awesome alliteration.</p>
<p>But that’s not preaching. That’s a <em><strong>show</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Preaching takes guts… It takes bravery to do the necessary hard work at the intersection between the stuff of God and the stuff of life.</p>
<p>Because, <strong>if what we Christians believe is TRUE, everything changes</strong>, and a preacher’s job is to make that clear.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to family and friends, it’s difficult to preach repentance to those who changed your diapers, calmed your tantrums, kept your secrets.</p>
<p>But every stressed out seminarian, every nervous young pastor preparing to preach to the home crowd, can take heart that the very One we preach, Jesus the Messiah, faced a similar challenge during his earthly preaching ministry.</p>
<h2 id="mark-1-5">Mark 1-5</h2>
<p>Please turn with me to the Gospel of Mark, beginning on page 836 of your pew Bibles.</p>
<p>To understand today’s Gospel text from Mark 6, we first need a bit of context from Mark chapters 1 through 5. Please follow along with me in your Bibles, glancing at the pages as I summarize these chapters.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I’d like us to note is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>Jesus is on a roll</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>Mark’s Gospel takes off quickly into the narrative of Jesus, who, after he is baptized by his forerunner John, is affirmed of his identity by the very voice of God. He is then driven yet sustained by the Spirit through the wilderness testings of Satan.</p>
<p>Jesus then returns from the wilderness and begins his preaching ministry in Galilee — boldly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.&rsquo;” (1:15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then calls his first disciples, who join him in his whirlwind ministry of preaching and teaching with authority, healing the sick, and casting out demons. So much for chapter 1!</p>
<p>In chapter 2, he challenges Jewish conceptions about the forgiveness of sins, fasting, and keeping Sabbath.</p>
<p>In chapter 3, we witness the first hints of outright opposition to Jesus on account of his unorthodox Sabbath practices, yet this is immediately followed by a description of Jesus’ growing crowd of followers.</p>
<p>Unfazed, Jesus calls and appoints the twelve apostles. He challenges the experts in Jewish Law, and scandalously stretches the boundaries of family.</p>
<p>In chapter 4, he teaches in parables, before commanding and calming the wind and the sea.</p>
<p>In chapter 5, he upsets an entire region by casting out a legion of demons. And before we get to chapter 6, he reverses death itself for the sake of a synagogue official, and reverses disease for the sake of a woman with a discharge of blood.</p>
<p><strong>In the face of FAITH,Jesus tells the dead to get up. He calls the physically, financially, and relationally destitute one “daughter.”</strong></p>
<p>Jesus is on a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>roll</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Jesus is up to something <strong>BIG</strong>, something <strong>NEW</strong>. He is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>bringing in the very kingdom of God</strong></span>, unexpectedly centered around HIMSELF, and NOTHING, NO ONE –</p>
<ul>
<li>not winds,</li>
<li>not waves,</li>
<li>not Pharisees,</li>
<li>not scribes,</li>
<li>not disease,</li>
<li>not destitution,</li>
<li>not demons,</li>
<li>not even DEATH – can stand in his way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, maybe <em><strong>one</strong></em> thing can.</p>
<h2 id="our-text-mark-61-13">Our Text: Mark 6:1-13</h2>
<p>We’re now on page 841, Mark chapter 6 begins this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He [Jesus] went away from there and came to his hometown [Nazareth], and his disciples followed him.</p>
<p>And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?”</p>
<p>And they took offense at him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, before I get to two negative aspects of the Nazarenes’ reaction, let’s consider two positives:</p>
<h3 id="first-in-verse-2-they-are-asking-the-right-questions">First, in verse 2, they are <strong>asking the right questions</strong>.</h3>
<p>They recognize that Jesus has wisdom, mighty works, mighty hands – things which should have reminded them of God himself:</p>
<p>The God who, according to Jeremiah (51:15),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“made the earth by his <strong>power</strong>, who established the world by his <strong>wisdom</strong>, and by his <strong>understanding</strong> stretched out the heavens.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The God who, according to Deuteronomy (4:34 and 7:19), rescued Israel from the house of slavery with a “<strong>mighty hand</strong> and an outstretched arm.”</p>
<p><strong>Jesus’ wisdom and mighty deeds should have persuaded them that God was up to something big, something new</strong>.</p>
<p>The Creator was <strong>re-creating</strong>. The Redeemer was <strong>rescuing</strong> and <strong>restoring</strong> — like Jesus had just done with Jairus’ daughter and the bleeding woman in chapter 5.</p>
<h3 id="second-in-verse-3-everything-the-hometown-crowd-says-is-factually-correct">Second, in verse 3, <strong>everything the hometown crowd says is factually correct!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Jesus was <em>in fact</em> a carpenter by family trade.</li>
<li>And although it’s perhaps a slur, or a reference to Joseph’s prior death, Jesus is <em>in fact</em> the “Son of Mary.”</li>
<li>He did <em>in fact</em> have siblings.</li>
<li>He was <em>in fact</em> from Nazareth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what’s wrong with the hometown reaction? Let me focus on two things:</p>
<h3 id="first-their-reaction-shows-us-that-span-styletext-decorationunderlineyou-can-ask-the-right-questions-with-the-wrong-attitudespan">First, their reaction shows us that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>you can ask the right questions with the wrong attitude</strong></span>.</h3>
<p>Sure, Jesus’ wisdom and mighty deeds should have persuaded them that God was up to something big, something new – and that they might have to change their lives because of it.</p>
<p>But instead, they ask their questions with incredulous skepticism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just who does Jesus think he is?</p>
<p>What right has he to say these things? To act this way?</p>
<p>We know who he really is. We watched him grow up!</p>
<p>He’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>just one of us</strong></em></span>, a normal Nazarene.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="second-then-their-reaction-shows-us-that-span-styletext-decorationunderlineyou-can-know-the-facts-and-miss-the-pointspan">Second, then, their reaction shows us that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>you can know the facts and miss the point</strong></span>.</h3>
<p>In fact, sometimes, you can use the facts in order to miss the point!</p>
<p>You can miss Truth with a capital “T” by focusing on the lowercase.</p>
<p>That’s what they’re doing here. The scandalized hometown crowd is bringing up the familiar, comfortable aspects of Jesus’ existence to give themselves a way out from underneath Jesus’ powerful claims on them and their future.</p>
<p>After all, they don’t have to repent in light of the coming Kingdom of God if this “King Jesus,” what with his preaching and working wonders like some kind of prophet, is really just the homeboy handyman who’s out of his mind, right?</p>
<p>So, Jesus responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.”</p>
<p>And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citing a familiar proverb of the day — something close to “familiarity breeds contempt” – Jesus steps into a long tradition of rejected prophets — those sent by Yahweh to diagnose the sins of his people and point them back to covenant loyalty, but repeatedly rejected because of their intensely unpopular proclamations.</p>
<p>Hear the haunting words of 2 Chronicles 36(:15-16). Commenting upon the faithlessness of Judah, it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.</p>
<p>But they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose against his people, until there was no remedy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(…speaking there of the Babylon exile)</p>
<p>Friends, <strong>Jesus is the remedy! He is Yahweh’s true Prophet! He brings us back from exile. He is the King in the Kingdom of God, with dominion over demons, disease, and death!</strong></p>
<p>And yet, in the face of stubborn unbelief at Nazareth, Mark is willing to say that Jesus was <em><strong>UNABLE</strong></em> to so a mighty work there.</p>
<p>Sure, he healed a few sick people, but <strong>whereas elsewhere in the Gospels it is the crowds who marvel at the mighty words and works of Jesus, here he himself is STUNNED by their unbelief!</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Sisters, brothers: <strong>You can know the facts, and miss the point. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Because FACTS aren’t FAITH.</span></strong></p>
<p>FAITH is not merely intellectual assent to true propositions about Jesus. Look back at Mark 5, to Jairus and the bleeding woman!</p>
<h4 id="faith-is-about-entrusting-yourself-your-entire-life-to-jesus-as-your-king--your-only-hope-your-only-lord"><strong>Faith is about entrusting yourself, your entire life, to Jesus as your King – your only Hope, your only Lord.</strong></h4>
<p>When you hear “<strong>faith</strong>,” think “<em>faithfulness</em>.” Think “<em>trust</em>.” Think “<em>loyalty</em>.”</p>
<p>Faith is something absolutely necessary for a relationship to exist. This is true with humans, and it’s true with God.</p>
<p>Knowing the right things, having the Creed memorized backwards and front, is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> the same as <strong>life-changing loyalty to Jesus Christ</strong>.</p>
<p>And, to be sure, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">faith cannot merely be produced by sheer force of will</span>. We would be nothing but <em>faithless</em> were it not for God’s <strong>grace</strong>.</p>
<p>But faith does involve our <strong>wills</strong>, our entire <strong>selves</strong>. It is something we <strong>commit</strong> to. It is something that, by God’s grace, we <strong>participate</strong> in.</p>
<p>And it is something that can be <em><strong>rejected</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Now, there are some in the world who would be perfectly comfortable to come right out say “<em>I reject and refuse Jesus as Lord.</em>” Unbelief can take the form of outright opposition to Jesus. In the Gospels, we see this in those who want Jesus dead.</p>
<p>But that’s not the rejection Jesus receives here at Nazareth. And, my guess is, that’s not the refusal he receives from me, from you, either.</p>
<p>Because, see, <strong>we’re prone to the subtler (and therefore greater) rejection of Jesus by making him to “just one of us.”</strong></p>
<p>Now, don’t misunderstand me. <strong>Jesus was and is fully human</strong>. He doesn’t save us from a distance. He dove from heaven’s heights into the muck and mire of our sin-stained existence to bring us back to God.</p>
<p>But this salvation involves <strong>repentance</strong>. It requires turning away from our faithless pursuit of Sin and Death. And it requires the faithfulness of turning toward our faithful God.</p>
<p>Salvation does not require us getting back to God on our own efforts or merit, but it does entail <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>complete and utter dependence on and allegiance to Jesus as King</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>But, as we’ve seen, we can <span style="text-decoration:underline;">escape</span> total allegiance to King Jesus if he’s “<em><strong>just one of us Nazarenes</strong></em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Friends, King Jesus is not “<em>just one of us</em>“!</strong></p>
<p>He has his own agenda of cosmic redemption. He has his own approach, which often appears upside-down to us, because it involves repentance and self-sacrifice, because it includes suffering on a bloodstained Cross before the triumph of the Empty Tomb.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>King Jesus is not “<em>just one of us</em>“!</strong></span></p>
<h4 id="so-the-uncomfortable-question-stands-are-we-loyal-to-king-jesus-above-all-else-or-are-we-loyal-to-a-jesus-weve-made-span-styletext-decorationunderlinein-our-own-imagespan">So the uncomfortable question stands: Are we loyal to King Jesus above all else? Or are we loyal to a “<em>Jesus</em>” we’ve made <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in our own image</span>?</h4>
<p>King Jesus is not “<em><strong>middle-to-upper-class-American-Jesus</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, he cares about the welfare of those around the world and those in this country more than we do. His agenda surely has implications for life here in the United States of America, and it very well might require the hard work of being faithful with many resources and possessions.</p>
<p>But, hear me:</p>
<h4 id="king-jesus-doesnt-just-want-to-add-a-pearly-gate-to-our-picket-fences-he-doesnt-just-want-to-stamp-a-jesus-approved-ticket-to-heaven-on-our-pre-existent-american-dream">King Jesus doesn’t just want to add a pearly gate to our picket fences. He doesn’t just want to stamp a Jesus-approved ticket to heaven on our pre-existent American Dream.</h4>
<h4 id="he-wants-us-to-crucify-the-american-dream">He wants us to crucify the American Dream!</h4>
<h4 id="he-calls-us-to-abandon-our-self-centered-agendas-of-upward-mobility-and-instead-to-take-up-our-crosses-to-adopt-his-others-focused-agenda-of-self-sacrificial-love">He calls us to abandon our self-centered agendas of upward mobility, and instead to take up our crosses! To adopt his others-focused agenda of self-sacrificial love!</h4>
<p>And just like it was for Jesus’ hometown crowd back then, our easiest way out of this required repentance now is <strong>to make Jesus’ message a little less demanding and his mission a little bit more like our own</strong>, <em><strong>until finally, faithlessly – though we may worship Jesus with our lips – in our hearts, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">we worship only ourselves</span>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Briefly notice with me that, in Mark 6:7-13, Jesus sends out his disciples to do what he himself had been doing: preaching repentance, casting out demons, and healing the sick.</p>
<h4 id="king-jesus-followers-carry-forward-his-mission-do-we">King Jesus’ followers carry forward his mission. Do we?</h4>
<h4 id="will-we-in-faith-entrust-our-entire-lives-in-allegiance-to-him-no-matter-the-changes-no-matter-the-costs">Will we, in faith, entrust our entire lives in allegiance to him? No matter the changes? No matter the costs?</h4>
<h4 id="will-we-refuse-to-make-jesus-into-just-one-of-us">Will we refuse to make Jesus into “just one of us”?</h4>
<h4 id="king-jesus-has-dominion-over-disease-demons-and-death-does-he-have-dominion-over-our-dreams-and-desires">King Jesus has dominion over disease, demons, and death. Does he have dominion over our dreams and desires?</h4>
<p>By God’s grace — given to us in the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ our Lord — By God’s amazing grace, <strong>may these things be so, may we follow him <span style="text-decoration:underline;">faithfully</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<em>The Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones – Gustave Dore</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>37 The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and placed me in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones.<br>
2 He made me walk all around among them. I realized there were a great many bones in the valley and they were very dry.<br>
3 He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said to him, “Sovereign Lord, you know.”<br>
4 Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.<br>
5 This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones: Look, I am about to infuse breath into you and you will live.<br>
6 I will put tendons on you and muscles over you and will cover you with skin; I will put breath in you and you will live. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>24 How many living things you have made, O Lord!<br>
You have exhibited great skill in making all of them;<br>
the earth is full of the living things you have made.</p>
<p>25 Over here is the deep, wide sea,<br>
which teems with innumerable swimming creatures,<br>
living things both small and large.</p>
<p>26 The ships travel there,<br>
and over here swims the whale you made to play in it.</p>
<p>27 All of your creatures wait for you<br>
to provide them with food on a regular basis.</p>
<p>28 You give food to them and they receive it;<br>
you open your hand and they are filled with food.</p>
<p>29 When you ignore them, they panic.<br>
When you take away their life’s breath, they die<br>
and return to dust.</p>
<p>30 When you send your life-giving breath, they are created,<br>
and you replenish the surface of the ground.</p>
<p>31 May the splendor of the Lord endure!<br>
May the Lord find pleasure in the living things he has made!</p>
<p>32 He looks down on the earth and it shakes;<br>
he touches the mountains and they start to smolder.</p>
<p>33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;<br>
I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist!</p>
<p>34 May my thoughts be pleasing to him!<br>
I will rejoice in the Lord.</p>

<em>Pentecôte by Jean II Restout</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.<br>
2 Suddenly a sound like a violent wind blowing came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting.<br>
3 And tongues spreading out like a fire appeared to them and came to rest on each one of them.<br>
4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.</p>
<p>5 Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem.<br>
6 When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.<br>
7 Completely baffled, they said, “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?<br>
8 And how is it that each one of us hears them in our own native language?<br>
9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia,<br>
10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,<br>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/12-28-14JoshSteeleHolyInnocents.mp3&#34;&gt;Today is December 28&lt;/a&gt; (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents&#34;&gt;The Slaughter of the Innocents&lt;/a&gt;,” the killing of the baby boys of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem&#34;&gt;Bethlehem&lt;/a&gt; by King &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great&#34;&gt;Herod&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07419a.htm&#34;&gt;to at least the fifth century&lt;/a&gt;. In the fourth century, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatius&#34;&gt;Chromatius&lt;/a&gt; described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf. Around the same time, St. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo&#34;&gt;Augustine&lt;/a&gt; claimed that these nameless victims, “&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;whom Herod’s cruelty tore as sucklings from their mothers’ bosom are justly hailed as the infant martyr flowers, the first buds of the church killed by the frost of persecution. They died not only for Christ but in his stead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/12-28-14JoshSteeleHolyInnocents.mp3">Today is December 28</a> (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents">The Slaughter of the Innocents</a>,” the killing of the baby boys of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> by King <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great">Herod</a>.</p>
<p>The Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07419a.htm">to at least the fifth century</a>. In the fourth century, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatius">Chromatius</a> described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf. Around the same time, St. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine</a> claimed that these nameless victims, “<em><strong>whom Herod’s cruelty tore as sucklings from their mothers’ bosom are justly hailed as the infant martyr flowers, the first buds of the church killed by the frost of persecution. They died not only for Christ but in his stead</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>What if we knew the names of the victims of Herod’s infamous, paranoid rage?</p>
<p>What if the cries of Bethlehem took place today in Birmingham?</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED (NAMES OF BOYS IN CHURCH AGED TWO AND UNDER)]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>
<p>May it never, ever be.</p>
<p>But what if such a tragedy took place inside our community?</p>
<p>Bright young lives, cut short by darkness.A deafening silence replaces the cries of the young.The tears of the parents a lingering reminder of the tears of their lost children.</p>
<p>May it never, ever be.</p>
<p>But it has been… and it frequently is… true.The small and the young are slaughtered by the big and supposedly powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hebrew babies, by Pharaoh.</li>
<li>Bethlehem’s young, by Herod.</li>
<li>Babies not yet born, by their parents.</li>
<li>Babies already born, by their parents.</li>
<li>Sandy Hook Elementary students, by Adam Lanza.</li>
<li>Students in Peshawar, by the Pakistani Taliban.</li>
<li>Pakistani children, by U.S. drone strikes.</li>
<li>Central American children, by gangs and drug lords…</li>
</ul>
<p>May it never, ever be?</p>
<p>Lord , have mercy! Lord Jesus, come quickly! For these things so often ARE.</p>
<p>You do not have to look far to spot evil.You do not have to look much further to spot violence that victimizes children.</p>
<p>This is not an ancient Egyptian or Judean issue,it is an issue for today – an issue for eternity.If it is not happening today in our community,it IS happening right now in some community.</p>
<p>Consider this, today, as we commemorate the “Holy Innocents” of Bethlehem– nameless to us,but called by name by both their parents and their God.</p>
<p>Consider this, today, as we contemplate <strong>how the Incarnation unveils both the source of and the desperate need for hope</strong>…the brilliant light of Christ against the dark backdrop of intense evil and incomprehensible suffering.</p>
<p>Let us pray…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O ALMIGHTY God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by their deaths: Mortify and kill all vices in us, and so strengthen us by thy grace, that by the innocency of our lives, and constancy of our faith even unto death, we may glorify thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve said that the Incarnation unveils both the source of and the desperate need for hope.Let us consider both together as we turn to <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearABC/HolyDays/HolyInno.html#GOSPEL">today’s Gospel text, Matthew 2:13–18</a>.</p>
<p>The structure of this passage is easy enough to ascertain.</p>
<ul>
<li>It begins, in vv. 13-15, by depicting the flight of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus from Bethlehem to Egypt – concluding in v. 15 with a quotation from Hosea 11:1.</li>
<li>Then, in vv. 16-18, we witness the grisly scene at Bethlehem, which is then linked by Matthew to a quotation from Jeremiah 31:15.</li>
<li>Although this sermon will only address these 6 verses, vv.19-23 complete the symmetry of these events by depicting the return of the family from Egypt to Nazareth in Galilee.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, then:</p>
<h2 id="i-in-telling-of-the-flight-to-egyptvv-13-15-portray-jesus-as-the-new-moses-the-true-israeland-the-source-of-hope">I. IN TELLING OF THE FLIGHT TO EGYPT,VV. 13-15 PORTRAY JESUS AS THE NEW MOSES, THE TRUE ISRAEL,AND THE SOURCE OF HOPE.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”</p>
<p>And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod.</p>
<p>This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet,</p>
<p>“Out of Egypt I called my son.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-the-flight">A. THE FLIGHT</h3>
<p>Verse 13 begins by referring to the departure of the wise men, after offering their now-famous gifts. And just as they were warned in a dream to take an alternate route home to avoid Herod, so Joseph is commanded in a dream by a messenger of the Lord to flee to Egypt to avoid Herod.</p>
<p>Herod the Great’s attempts to destroy the Christ-child here echo the much earlier attempts of Pharaoh to kill Moses in the book of Exodus – first, generally and unwittingly, by ordering all Hebrew baby boys to be cast into the Nile (Exod. 1:22); and then, even more specifically, when Pharaoh tried to kill Moses after Moses’ had murdered a nameless Egyptian (Exod. 2:15). In this way, Matthew links Herod with Pharaoh, and Jesus with Moses.</p>
<p>Therefore , although Egypt was, in the immediate sense, a natural destination to escape Herod’s jurisdiction, Matthew is drawing deeper connections. Egypt was the house of slavery from which the nation of Israel was redeemed. It is significant, then, that the Son of God goes there as a refugee before returning to the land of Israel to redeem the world.</p>
<p>The urgency of the angel’s command matches the urgency with which it was obeyed. The family made the approximately 90 mile journey, beginning under cover of darkness. And they obediently remained there u<br>
ntil receiving further instructions – until Herod would later die, allowing them to return and to journey to Nazareth in Galilee.</p>
<h3 id="b-the-fulfillment">B. THE FULFILLMENT</h3>
<p>And then Matthew says that these things happened in order that that which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet – in this case, the prophet Hosea – might be fulfilled: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” As I have mentioned, this comes from Hosea 11, from a beautiful prophetic passage which begins by speaking of Israel and the Exodus – the formative event in the birth of the young nation, the young “son” of God.</p>
<p>This way of speaking about Israel as God’s son comes from the book of Exodus itself, when Moses is told to tell Pharaoh ***“Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son,*<em><strong>and I say to you ‘Let my son go that he may serve me” (4:22–23a).</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a metaphorical use of the word “son” to refer to the relationship between Yahweh and his people. However, as the Exodus passage continues, if Pharaoh refused to let Yahweh’s metaphorical firstborn son go, Yahweh would kill Pharaoh’s literal firstborn son.</p>
<p>Literal and metaphorical sonship collide in the person of Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God who fully shares the divine nature of his Father, and he is also the Son of God who fulfills the calling and the destiny of the nation of Israel.Here his sojourn in Egypt fulfills the Exodus. Later, in Matthew 4, his wilderness temptation fulfills the Old Testament wilderness wanderings.Jesus is not just the New Moses. He is the True Israel.</p>
<p>Only when divine sonship is seen as an important biblical theme does this Hosea quotation make sense. Matthew is not proof-texting here, because in the Hosea passage, the “son” immediately turns away from Yahweh to idolatry in the very next verse!Instead , Matthew is claiming that the link Hosea made between the people of Israel and God’s “son” finds its fullest meaning – it is fulfilled and completed – in the person of Jesus.</p>
<p>Already , early in Matthew’s Gospel, we get the sense that Christ is going to change things, He’s going to complete God’s mission of setting the world right again.</p>
<p>I wish I could end there. However,</p>
<h2 id="ii-in-telling-of-the-slaughter-of-the-innocentsvv-16-18-reveal-the-desperate-need-for-hope"><strong>II. IN TELLING OF THE SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS,VV. 16-18 REVEAL THE DESPERATE NEED FOR HOPE.</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.</p>
<p>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</p>
<p>“A voice was heard in Ramah,</p>
<p>weeping and loud lamentation,</p>
<p>Rachel weeping for her children;</p>
<p>she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-the-massacre"><strong>A. THE MASSACRE</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents#cite_note-17">estimates</a>, the number of baby boys killed in the region of Bethlehem would have been between 10 and 30.In the course of the Church’s commemoration of this event, the number has grown drastically – to 14,000; 64,000; or even 144,000.</p>
<p>Of course , some have gone to the opposite extreme and claimed that this event never actually happened.Matthew must have been making this story up to draw the connections between Jesus and Moses. He had the Old Testament texts and made a story to match.</p>
<p><strong>That’s one way around this difficult text,but I think it’s a cop-out.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew quotes Jeremiah 31:15 and therefore creates a link in reverse to the Old Testament passage. However, in a certain sense, this link only works in one direction. That is, if one only had Jeremiah 31:15, it is obviously not a straightforward prophecy of a bloodthirsty ruler killing babies.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew is using the Old Testament to make some sense of this senseless slaughter, not to create it.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore , this massacre at Bethlehem fits quite well with the historical portrait we have of Herod – especially in his later years. Herod was crazy. If he thought you were a threat to his power, goodbye! The man even killed three of his own sons.</p>
<p>It is therefore not altogether surprising that, as terrible as it was, the deaths of a dozen or so babies in the hill town of Bethlehem would not have made it into the secular history books of that violent period.</p>
<p>I still think it happened.</p>
<p>Does that make you feel any better?</p>
<p>Perhaps a victory for the historical reliability of the Gospel accounts, but at what cost?</p>
<p>We’re still left with bereaved mothers and bloodstained cribs.</p>
<p>I don’t feel any better.</p>
<p>Although I’m sure I’ll find this passage even more poignant when, Lord-willing, I am a parent myself someday,some of its true weight hit me for the first time when, after reading the passage together, my wife (a pediatric nurse) started to tear-up and, after a long silence, said: “<em><strong>I don’t understand why those children had to die for Jesus to come… If I’m honest, it makes me angry</strong></em>.”</p>
<p><u>She has a point, right?</u> If God could save Jesus from bloodthirsty Herod, why not the Bethlehem babies? Didn’t the angel of the Lord have enough free time to show up in the dreams of the other Bethlehem parents? Doesn’t this event, like all the others I mentioned in my introduction, rightly prompt the question, perhaps asked with a tone of weeping and loud lamentation: <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”?</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="b-the-fulfillment-1"><strong>B. THE FULFILLMENT</strong></h3>
<p>This passage sticks with me partially because my wife’s name is Rachel. She has wept, as a nurse, over the often senseless suffering of her patients. And she is not alone. Matthew draws our attention to Jeremiah 31:15, depicting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel">Rachel</a> – the wife of Jacob, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin – as weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are no more. <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”</strong></em></p>
<p>The original context of this passage is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity">the Babylonian invasion and exile</a> of the people of Judah. Ramah, just 5 miles north of Jerusalem, was where the exiles were assembled in 586 B.C. for the journey into Babylon.</p>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah witnessed Jerusalem destroyed and its inhabitants terrorized. He poetically depicts Rachel, the Old Testament’s paradigmatic and idealized mother of the people of Israel, as weeping for her children as they go into exile.</p>
<p>Imagine Eve, the mother of the living, weeping as she looks forward from the past to see all the horrible effects of the exile from Eden, and you’ll get a similar idea.</p>

</p>
<p>The connection is HOPE.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 31:15, although tragic, occurs in a hopeful section of the book. In fact, the chapter of Jeremiah 31 is best known for its depiction in vv.31–40 of the New Covenant! The quoted verse about Rachel weeping is followed by these two verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus says the Lord:</p>
<p>“ Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work, declares the Lord, and they shall come back from the land of the enemy.</p>
<p>There is hope for your future, declares the Lord, and your children shall come back to their own country.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rachel was weeping over the exile.And she is promised that it will one day end.The exiles will return – as they began to do,48 years later, in 538 BC.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that <u>this “prophecy” did not somehow cause the tragedy at Bethlehem</u>.As John Calvin notes in his Gospel commentary, because Jeremiah’s oracle had its own fulfillment regarding the exile to Babylon and the subsequent return, “Matthew does not mean that it foretold what Herod would do, but that the coming of Christ occasioned a renewal of that mourning, which had been experienced, many centuries before,” by the people of Israel.</p>
<p>Because , you’ll notice, <strong>the people of Israel were still in exile</strong>. Sure, five centuries had passed since they had physically returned, but they still lived under a foreign ruler, not a son of David, who could enter the city of David at will and have the baby boys slaughtered.</p>
<p><strong>We have an encounter between two kings in this passage</strong>. The first, a crazed old man, is the illegitimate king of the Jews – deathly afraid of pretenders to his throne. The second, a vulnerable human baby, is the legitimate king of the Jews and of the world.</p>
<p>When faced with the latter, the former should have bowed the knee – as did the wise men (who, you’ll notice, came from the exile-lands of Babylon and Persia). Instead, Herod draws the sword, and the Son of God goes into exile, a refugee in the ancient land of slavery from which his people were bought and delivered by Yahweh.</p>
<p>With the mothers of Bethlehem, Rachel was still weeping.</p>
<p>Her children were not yet home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>
<p>What do we make of this?</p>
<p>Although the Jeremiah quotation points in the direction of hope, you’ll notice that Matthew leaves it hanging on a note of lamentation.</p>
<p>Might I suggest that <strong><u>the yearly Feast of the Holy Innocents is our liturgical antidote to a merely superficial and sentimental Christmas season</u></strong>?</p>
<p>The realities of Bethlehem, of the Christian faith, and of our lives, often have more blood, sweat, and tears in them than we care to admit – more pain than our idyllic notions can contain.</p>
<p>The Incarnation is glorious, but it’s also <u>messy</u>. Because we are messy! The human race – this very room! – is filled with Herods. We may not all kill babies out of fear, but our fear does drive us toward death. Think of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do our fears – of rejection, of failure, of powerlessness – drive us to do to <em>rupture</em> our relationships with God and with our fellow humans?</li>
<li>What do our fears – of intimacy, of scarcity, of being taken advantage of – prevent us from doing to <em>foster</em> those same relationships?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sisters and brothers, we Christians cannot afford an escapist religion of mere sentimentality which is out of touch with this broken and twisted world.</p>
<h3 id="we-cannot-afford-an-escapist-religion-because-we-do-not-worship-an-escapist-god"><strong>We</strong> <strong>cannot afford an escapist religion because we do not worship an escapist God!</strong></h3>
<p>Now , remember: <strong>evil is incomprehensible</strong>. It is the impossible possibility – a headlong dive, away from the source of Life and Light, into the arms of nothingness and darkness. <strong>It</strong> <strong>makes no sense!</strong></p>
<p>Therefore , some neat and tidy “answers” to the problem of evil can themselves be evil – by trying to explain that which cannot be explained!</p>
<p>Don’t offer or seek such “answers.” It’s better to remain silent, or to cry out <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”</strong></em> Job did. Jesus did.</p>
<p>JESUS DID…on the Cross!</p>
<h3 id="evil-cannot-and-should-not-be-explained-but-it-can-has-been-and-will-be-defeated"><strong>Evil cannot and should not be explained. But it can, has been, and will be defeated!</strong></h3>
<p>Although it does not lessen the tragedy, King Jesus, the commander of heaven’s armies, did not abandon these baby boys, his very first standard-bearers, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Chrysologus">Peter Chrysologus</a> noted. Instead, he sent them on ahead of himself into victory.</p>
<p>Although it does not lessen the tragedies we face, our God does not escape evil and suffering at our expense.</p>
<p>Sure , he escaped Herod once…in order to make it to the <u>Cross</u>,where he took Sin and Death to their bitter end in our stead.</p>
<p>He went into the furthest and fullest exile – the grave –in order to bring us back from our exile.</p>
<p>This return will look a bit different from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Zion">return</a> in 538 BC, for it will be full and final.</p>
<p>As our <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearABC/HolyDays/HolyInno.html#EPISTLE">second lesson</a> today describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.</p>
<p>He will dwell with us, and we will be his people, and God himself will be with us as our God.</p>
<p>He will wipe away every tear from our eyes, from the eyes of Bethlehem’s mothers and from the eyes of Bethlehem’s babies.</p>
<p>And death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God, the Alpha and the Omega, whose justice and mercy far outstrip our own, will make all things new.</p>
<p><strong>God will be our God.</strong></p>
<p>And because of His Son – who joined us in our distant depths, and went into exile in our stead to bring us home – <strong>We will be God’s daughters and sons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not to take away from the undeniably biblical teaching that God is almighty, but sometimes I think &lt;strong&gt;we lose sight of God&amp;rsquo;s love for his image-bearers when we emphasize certain &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; portraits of God at the expense of (instead of alongside of) other &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; portraits found in Scripture&lt;/strong&gt;. (I put &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; in quotes because perhaps our definitions of strength and weakness therefore need to change!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might make some of us uncomfortable to read about God portrayed as a jilted lover or a frustrated mother, but those portraits just might be desperately needed in a time when so many people turn away from God because they can&amp;rsquo;t understand how he can possibly be the good Lord of a world so broken and dying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to take away from the undeniably biblical teaching that God is almighty, but sometimes I think <strong>we lose sight of God&rsquo;s love for his image-bearers when we emphasize certain &ldquo;strong&rdquo; portraits of God at the expense of (instead of alongside of) other &ldquo;weak&rdquo; portraits found in Scripture</strong>. (I put &ldquo;strong&rdquo; and &ldquo;weak&rdquo; in quotes because perhaps our definitions of strength and weakness therefore need to change!)</p>
<p>It might make some of us uncomfortable to read about God portrayed as a jilted lover or a frustrated mother, but those portraits just might be desperately needed in a time when so many people turn away from God because they can&rsquo;t understand how he can possibly be the good Lord of a world so broken and dying.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not let our emphasis on God as King make him seem like a distant despot, or something dangerously close to the author of evil. We worship a God who is immanent in his transcendence, and we don&rsquo;t all need to become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_theology">process theologians</a> to recognize this. Perhaps we just need to read the prophets! Consider the following two examples:</p>
<p><em><strong>When Israel was a child, I loved him,</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>and out of Egypt I called my son.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>The more I called them,</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>the further they went from me;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>they kept sacrificing to the Baals,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>and they burned incense to idols.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>I took them up in my arms,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>but they did not know that I healed them.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>I led them</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>with bands of human kindness,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>with cords of love.</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>I treated them like those</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>who lift infants to their cheeks;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>I bent down to them and fed them.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I won’t act on the heat of my anger;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>I won’t return to destroy Ephraim;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>for I am God and not a human being,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>the holy one in your midst;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>I won’t come in harsh judgment.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>They will walk after the</strong></em><em>Lord</em>***,***</p>
<p><strong>who roars like a lion.</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>When he roars,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>his children will come trembling from the west.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>They will come trembling like a bird,</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>and like a dove from the land of Assyria;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>and I will return them to their homes, says the<strong><strong>Lord</strong></strong>.</strong>* (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+11&amp;amp;version=CEB">Hosea 11:1-4; 9-11, CEB</a>)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>***As for your birth, on the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water; you were certainly not rubbed down with salt, nor wrapped with blankets.*<em><strong>No eye took pity on you to do even one of these things for you to spare you; you were thrown out into the open field because you were detested on the day you were born.</strong></em></p>
<p>***“‘I passed by you and saw you kicking around helplessly in your blood. I said to you as you lay there in your blood, “Live!” I said to you as you lay there in your blood, “Live!”*<em><strong>I made you plentiful like sprouts in a field; you grew tall and came of age so that you could wear jewelry. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, but you were still naked and bare.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“‘Then I passed by you and watched you, noticing that you had reached the age for love. I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness. I swore a solemn oath to you and entered into a marriage covenant with you, declares the sovereign</strong></em><em>Lord</em>***, and you became mine.***</p>
<p>***“‘Then I bathed you in water, washed the blood off you, and anointed you with fragrant oil.****I dressed you in embroidered clothing and put fine leather sandals on your feet. I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.****I adorned you with jewelry. I put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck.*<em><strong>I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.<strong><strong>You were adorned with gold and silver, while your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidery. You ate the finest flour, honey, and olive oil. You became extremely beautiful and attained the position of royalty.<strong><strong>Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty; your beauty was perfect because of the splendor which I bestowed on you, declares the sovereign</strong></strong>Lord</strong></strong>.</strong></em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2016&amp;amp;version=NET">Ezekiel 16:4-14, NET</a>)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Notice that God&rsquo;s immanence, his willingness to suffer alongside us (and in our stead, through Christ), doesn&rsquo;t negate his hatred for sin. Instead, I&rsquo;d argue that <strong>God&rsquo;s immanence intensifies his negative reaction to Sin and Death as his cosmic enemies!</strong> Emmanuel, God with us, sees our sickness for what it truly is. It&rsquo;s not something to be trifled with, and it doesn&rsquo;t just upset God because it &ldquo;breaks his list of rules.&rdquo; No, sin breaks God&rsquo;s good creation. It is a cancer which kills from within, even dragging his precious image bearers down to the grave…blinding them to the horrible reality of their downfall, and enticing them, enticing US with phantoms of fleeting pleasure.</p>
<p>This rambling post was inspired by the following two songs, which capture the above ideas beautifully. The first is <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4xyARNLYUCYc0HubY88IX8">&ldquo;Ezekiel,&rdquo; by Gungor</a>, based on the text of Ezekiel 16. The second is <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/78BUC2TstlFmGvI1pvNhTT">&ldquo;Not Your Type&rdquo; by Noah James</a>. Give both a listen if you have the time!</p>

<p>The following series of quotations comes from a lengthy small-print section in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Dogmatics">CD</a> <a href="http://www.foundationrt.org/outlines/Barth_Dogmatics_Volume_IV.pdf">IV</a>/1, 259-73 <em>(<span style="font-family:&background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">§ 59 The Obedience of the Son of God; 2. The Judge Judged in Our Place)</span></em>. There Barth walks through the three wilderness temptations before masterfully connecting them to Christ&rsquo;s experience in the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<p>On page 261, the discussion of the temptations begins:</p>
<p><strong><u>The First Temptation: Stones into Bread (CD IV/1, 261-2)</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Garamond">&ldquo;In both Evangelists [<em>Matthew and Luke</em>] the first Satanic suggestion is that after the forty days of hunger He should change the stones of the wilderness into bread in the power of His divine Sonship by His Word.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<p><font face="Garamond">For Barth, it is important that Christ is not tempted in the wilderness to any sort of moral violations of the Law. Instead, he is tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For this is the form and content of Jesus&rsquo; sinlessness — not a vague moral perfection, but specifically his obedience and repentance.</font></p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Garamond">&ldquo;What would it have meant if Jesus had yielded? <u>He would have used the power of God which He undoubtedly had like a technical instrument placed at His disposal to save and maintain His own life. He would then have stepped out of the series of sinners in which He placed Himself in His baptism in Jordan. Of His own will He would have abandoned the role of the One who fasts and repents for sinners. He would have broken off His fasting and repentance in the fulness of divine power and with the help of God, but without consulting the will and commandment of God, because in the last resort His primary will was to live. He would have refused to give Himself unreservedly to be the one great sinner who allows that God is in the right, to set His hopes for the redemption and maintenance of His life only on the Word of God, in the establishment of which He was engaged in this self-offering.</u> He would have refused to be willing to live only by this Word and promise of God, and therefore to continue to hunger.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<p><font face="Garamond">From a &ldquo;human&rdquo; standpoint, however, choosing self-preservation over starvation makes perfect sense!</font></p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Garamond">&ldquo;In so doing He would, of course, only have done what in His place and with His powers all other men would certainly have done. <u>From the standpoint of all other men He would only have acted reasonably and rightly</u>. &ldquo;Rabbi, eat&rdquo; is what His disciples later said to Him (Jn. 4<sup>31</sup>) quite reasonably and in all innocence. But then He would not have made it His meat &ldquo;to do the will of him that sent him, and to</font><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">finish his work&rdquo; (Jn. 4</span><sup style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">34</sup><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">  
</span>
<p><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">However, Christ the God-Human is more human and less sinful than us in his refusal to abandon obedience and repentance. For this reason, his repentance was perfect — a repentance unto redemption.</span></p>
<span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">&quot;<u>Instead of acting for all other men and in their place, He would have left them in the lurch at the very moment when He had made their cause His own. Jesus withstood this temptation. He persisted in obedience, in penitence, in fasting</u>. He hungered in confidence in the promise of manna with which the same God had once fed the fathers in the wilderness after He had allowed them to hunger (Deut. 8</span><sup style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">3</sup><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">). <u>He willed to live only by that which the Word of God creates, and therefore as one of the sinners who have no hope apart from God, as the Head and King of this people. His decision was, therefore, a different one from that which all other men would have taken in His place, and in that way it was the righteousness which He achieved in their stead</u>.&quot;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">  
</span>
<p><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">Stay tuned for Karl Barth&rsquo;s exegesis of the second temptation, for Christ to fall down and worship Satan.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">Yesterday I posted the beginning of Karl Barth&rsquo;s exegesis of Christ&rsquo;s wilderness temptations</a>. He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus&rsquo; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">first temptation was to turn stones into bread</a>, thereby using divine power as a &ldquo;technical instrument&rdquo; to save and maintain his own life. Today&rsquo;s temptation contains an incisive critique of Christendom&rsquo;s desire for influence, relevance, and power.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Second Temptation: Christendom&rsquo;s Cost — Worship Satan (CD IV/1, 262)</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;According to Luke, the second Satanic suggestion is that <u>Satan, to whom the world belongs, should give him lordship over it, at the price of His falling down and worshipping him</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barth gets right to the point, interpreting this temptation. Notice again the theme of abandoning repentance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What would it have meant if Jesus had done this?Obviously <u>He would have shown that He repented having received the baptism of John and that He did not intend to complete the penitence which He had begun</u>. <u>He would have ceased to recognise and confess the sin of the world as sin, to take it upon Himself as such, and in His own person to bring to an issue the conflict with it (as with man&rsquo;s contradiction against God and himself)</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terrible, right? But consider how pragmatism rears its ugly head!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He would have won through and been converted to a <u>simpler</u> and more <u>practical</u> and more <u>realistic</u> approach and way. He would have determined to drop the question of the overcoming and removing of evil, <u>to accept the undeniable fact of the overlordship of evil in the world</u>, and to do good, even the best, on this indisputable presupposition, on the ground and in the sphere of this overlordship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so even then, the phrase &ldquo;undeniable overlordship of evil&rdquo; sounds quite nasty. But Barth is driving home an incisive critique of Christendom — the unholy marriage between the Kingdom of God and the kingdoms of humanity and the Devil.</p>
<p>The following question is haunting. I am particularly struck by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;ecumenical.&rdquo; If we are not careful, isn&rsquo;t this almost exactly what many Christians desire? How far are we willing to go to obtain influence and power?</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div><div>"<u>Why not set up a real kingdom of God on earth? an international order modelled on the insights of Christian humanitarianism, in which, of course, a liberal-orthodox, ecumenical, confessional Church might also find an appropriate place?</u></div><div></div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>And we can still fall prey to this temptation, without completely giving up our God! Just worship God and bow the knee, even secretly, to Satan. Sure, you can still be pious. Just achieve your piety&rsquo;s ends through the gears and cogs of the world-machine! You want to be relevant? Hitch your goals to a movement, a political party, a military!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div></div><div>"Note that to do this <u>He was not asked to renounce God or to go over to atheism</u>. <u>He had only to lift His hat to the usurper. He had only to bow the knee discreetly and privately to the devil</u>. He had only to make the quiet but solid and irreversible acknowledgment that <u>in that world of splendour the devil should have the first and final word, that at bottom everything should remain as it had been</u>.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div><div>However, Barth's point is that, in doing so, Christ would have completely given up the redemptive mission. We must take heed, especially in our ostensibly "Christian" nation (according to some in the US, at least), lest we do the same.</div><div></div>> <div>"On this condition <u>we can all succeed in the world, and Jesus most of all</u>. In the divine and human kingdom set up on this condition <u>there would have been no place for the cross</u>. Or rather, <u>in this world ostensibly ruled by Jesus but secretly by Satan, the cross would have been harmlessly turned into a fine and profound symbol: an ornament in the official philosophy and outlook; but also an adornment (e.g., an episcopal adornment) in the more usual sense of the word; a suitable recollection of that which Jesus avoided and which is not therefore necessary for anyone else</u>.</div>
<div></div><div>Christ succeeded at this point where every other human would have failed.</div><div></div>> <div>"<u>What other man in Jesus' place would not have been clever enough to close with this offer?</u> But what He had to do and willed to do in place of all would not then have been done. <u>He would again have left them in the lurch and betrayed them, in spite of all the fine and good things that the world-kingdom of Satan and Jesus might have meant for them</u>.</div>
<div></div><div>Attractive realism vs. repentance and obedience. Will we take Christ's example and Barth's critique to heart, as the Church constantly faces the temptation to give allegiance to the powers, empires, and corporations of this world?</div><div></div>> <div>"<u>For of what advantage is even the greatest glory to a world which is still definitively unreconciled with God</u>? Of what gain to man are all the conceivable advantages and advances of such a kingdom? But Jesus resisted this temptation too. He refused to be won over to this <u>attractive realism</u>. <u>As the one great sinner in the name and place of all others, without any prospect of this glory, quite unsuccessfully, indeed with the certainty of failure, He willed to continue worshipping and serving God alone. He willed to persist in repentance and obedience. This was the righteousness which He achieved for us</u>."</div><div></div>
<p>Stay tuned for tomorrow&rsquo;s temptation, which Barth considers the most astonishing: &ldquo;<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19px;text-align:left;">to commit an act of supreme, unconditional, blind, absolute, total confidence in God-as was obviously supremely fitting for the Son of God.&quot;</span></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reproducing&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth&#34;&gt;Karl Barth&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;magnificent exegesis of Christ&amp;rsquo;s wilderness temptations in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Dogmatics&#34;&gt;Church Dogmatics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; IV/1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a particularly appropriate discussion for this season of&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent&#34;&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;, for Jesus was not tempted to break the Law or commit a moral infraction. Instead, he was tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For Barth, if Christ had capitulated to any of the temptations, he would have abandoned God&amp;rsquo;s redemptive mission.

<p>In response to the<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">first temptation, to turn stones into bread</a>, Christ refused to use divine power as a &ldquo;technical instrument&rdquo; to preserve his own life. In response to the <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-2-christendoms-cost-worship-satan">second temptation, to worship Satan in exchange for authority and power</a>, Christ refused to sell redemption short by establishing a Christendom &ldquo;ostensibly ruled by Jesus but secretly by Satan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which brings us to today&rsquo;s discussion:</p>
<p><strong><u><br>
</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>The Third Temptation: The Leap of False Faith (CD IV/1, 262-4)</u></strong></p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<p><font face="Garamond">Barth begins by noting the climactic, surprising nature of this third temptation, given the temple setting and Satan&rsquo;s use of Scripture:</font></p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<blockquote>
<div><font face="Garamond">"The third temptation, according to Luke's account, is the most astonishing of all. The dignity of the setting, the temple of God in the holy city of Jerusalem, is obviously incomparably greater than the still secular dignity of that high mountain from which Jesus was shown and offered all the kingdoms of the world. It is of a piece that Satan now appears as an obviously pious man who</font></div><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">can even quote the Psalms of David, and he gains in the seriousness and weight of his approach. Above all, his suggestion-we can hardly describe it by the horrible word temptation-<u>is quite different from everything that has preceded it</u>.</span>
</blockquote>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<p><span style="line-height:19px;">The temptation at hand is different from the preceding one&rsquo;s in terms of its apparent piety! Isn&rsquo;t an act of &ldquo;total confidence in God&rdquo; appropriate for God&rsquo;s Son?</span></p>
<span style="line-height:19px;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&ldquo;It now consists in <u>the demand to commit an act of supreme, unconditional, blind, absolute, total confidence in God-as was obviously supremely fitting for the Son of God</u>. We might almost say, an act in the sense of and in line with the answers which Jesus Himself had given to the first two temptations, <u>to live only by the Word of God, to serve and worship Him alone</u>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">Indeed, it doesn&rsquo;t take much imagination to see the connection between Jesus&rsquo; response to the first two temptations and what he is asked to do here. However, Barth points out that this is not designed to be a miraculous demonstration of Jesus&rsquo; Messianic identity. Instead, it something even more nefarious:</span></p>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&ldquo;In the last decades we have become accustomed to think of the seeking and attaining of <u>totalitarian dominion as the worst of all evils, as that which is specifically demonic</u>. But if the climax in Luke is right, <u>there is something even worse and just as demonic</u>. It is <u>not</u> just a matter of <u>a miraculous display to reveal the Messiahship of Jesus</u>. It is often interpreted in this way, but by a reading into the text rather than out of it. The text itself makes no mention whatever of spectators. It is rather a question of <u>the testing and proving, of the final assuring of His relationship to God<em>in foro conscientiae</em></u></span><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;"><u>, in the solitariness of man with God</u>. Jesus is to risk this headlong plunge with the certainty, and to <u>confirm the certainty, that God and His angels are with Him and will keep Him</u>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">Christ is asked to affirm, to certify on his own terms, the relationship between him and God. Barth then uses Schlatter to demonstrate the connections between this temptation and some familiar theological concepts:</span></p>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&ldquo;Schlatter has rather mischievously said that what we have here is what is so glibly described &ldquo;in contemporary theological literature&rdquo; as <u>the &ldquo;leap&rdquo; of faith</u>. It certainly does seem to be something very like &ldquo;existence in transcendence,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the leap into the unknown,&rdquo; or in Reformation language &ldquo;<u>justification by faith alone</u>,&rdquo; <u>justification in the sense that</u> (in face of death and the last judgment, and in the hope that in trust in God these can be overcome) <u>man presumes to take it into his own hands, to carry it through as the work of his own robust faith, and in that way to have a part in it and to be certain of it</u>; just as Empedocles (we do not know exactly why, but seriously and with courage) finally flung himself into the smoking crater of Etna, which is supposed to have thrown out again only his sandals; just as on this very same rock of the temple, when it was stormed by the Romans in A.D. 70, the last of the high priests put themselves to death with their own hands, possibly in despair, possibly in the hope that there would be a supreme miracle at that last hour.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">Such faith ceases to be true faith. The grasp for certainty destroys it from the inside out. And yet, because Christ will eventually take something similar to this leap of faith, Barth interprets it further:</span></p>
<p><span style="
background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;"><br>
</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">Notice the return of <strong>penitence</strong> as a theme, which is contrasted against a desire to turn faith in on itself, to experiment with God by demanding his acceptance of an apparently robust faith/piety:</span></p>

He would have demanded that <u>He should be the most false of all false gods, the god of the religious man</u>. And in so doing He would Himself have <u>withdrawn from the society of sinful men as whose Representative and Head He was ordained to live and act.

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&ldquo;Look how strong my faith is, God!&rdquo; What religious human being would not have taken this leap of false faith in Christ&rsquo;s place? Barth pulls no punches in unveiling the subtle power-plays against God often at work in the religious enterprise:</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">This is not the way we usually interpret the righteousness of God at work in the wilderness temptations! And yet, it seems to be the unavoidable conclusion, given that the Son of God had to face these extremely unique temptations to retain his role as the Perfect Penitent on his way to the Cross. Yet even here, we are granted a glimpse of hope, of the resurrection to come:</span></p>

This is unavoidable, because we have to do with it <u>in the wilderness, in the kingdom of demons, in the world unreconciled with God, and in conflict with that world</u>. It is unavoidable because <u>what we have here is a prefiguring of the passion</u>. But in the passion, and in this prefiguring of it, <u><strong><font color="#FF0000">the No of God is only the hard shell of the divine Yes</font></strong>, which in both cases is spoken in the righteous act of this one man</u>. That this is the case is revealed at the conclusion of the accounts in Mark and Matthew by <u>the mention of the angels who, when Satan had left Him, came and ministered unto Him</u>. The great and glorious complement to this at the conclusion of the passion is the story of the <u>resurrection</u>.&quot;</span></p>

      <title>My Sermon: Our Help</title>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/my-sermon-our-help/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey internet: I was recently given the chance to preach at my church, &lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/&#34;&gt;St. Peter’s Anglican&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25&#34;&gt;Second Sunday of Lent&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3&#34;&gt;sermon audio is now online&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve got 23 minutes to spare, &lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3&#34;&gt;give it a listen&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25&#34;&gt;here are the passages&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psalm 121&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genesis 12:1-4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romans 4:1-5, 13-17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John 3:1-17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, make sure to &lt;strong&gt;ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3&#34;&gt; in the audio&lt;/a&gt;, I departed from my notes — which ended at “Nicodemus then fades from the narrative,” (which he does in the passage at hand) — and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again. As I was quickly reminded after the service, &lt;strong&gt;he does appear twice more in John’s Gospel&lt;/strong&gt;. Oops! Next time I’ll stick to my notes and not make any extemporaneous comments about minor characters without thinking through the context first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Concerning Romans</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/concerning-romans/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 11:29:22 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://www.treybailey.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/romans_title.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/&#34;&gt;concerned the chaos at Cedarville University&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;my shameful alma mater&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets&#34;&gt;2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow (see&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/07/my-regional-ets-presentation-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/&#34;&gt; my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, and come to my presentation at &lt;strong&gt;5:00pm in room S009!&lt;/strong&gt;), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

</p>
<p>Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/">concerned the chaos at Cedarville University</a>!</p>
<p>However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">my shameful alma mater</a> at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets">2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS</a> tomorrow (see<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/07/my-regional-ets-presentation-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/"> my previous post</a>, and come to my presentation at <strong>5:00pm in room S009!</strong>), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, given the current discussion in my New Testament Theology — two classes on Romans — I thought I might re-post two of my previous works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/06/28/romans-revisited-pt-1/">Romans. Revisited.</a> (or <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/05/03/the-argument-story-of-romans/">“The Argument-Story of Romans”</a>):</strong> my final write-up for Dr. Chris Miller’s course on Romans and Galatians at Cedarville University. We were due to have an oral exam on the last day of class, in which we talked-through the logic of the epistle. I wrote this summary the night before the exam, and was given the opportunity to present it to the class. I now present it to you! Feel free to give me some push-back!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/romans-13/">Romans 13:1-7 — A Contextually-Appropriate Reading</a>:</strong> a paper I wrote for the same course as mentioned above, in which I defend the following thesis: <strong>“Far from being a comprehensive condensation of the apostle’s beliefs regarding any and all governments past and present, [Romans 13:1-7] is a specific and historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, discouraging them from political unrest, disobedience, and rebellion in order to protect their testimony and the effectiveness of the Roman church in the gospel mission.”</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all for now. Grace and Peace.</p>

I’ve just finished the latter, and hope to write my review in the next day or two. However, I’d like to share the following quotes on &lt;em&gt;Deconstructive Literalism&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Perfect Translation&lt;/em&gt;, because I find the concepts intriguing as a student of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence&#34;&gt;Eugene Nida’s dynamic or functional equivalence&lt;/a&gt; (when it comes to both NT Greek and modern Spanish), and a newcomer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_theory&#34;&gt;relevance theory&lt;/a&gt;, which Goodwin uses to provide a way forward in the shadow of the KJV tradition. More on that later. In the meantime:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’ve just finished the latter, and hope to write my review in the next day or two. However, I’d like to share the following quotes on <em>Deconstructive Literalism</em> and <em>The Perfect Translation</em>, because I find the concepts intriguing as a student of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence">Eugene Nida’s dynamic or functional equivalence</a> (when it comes to both NT Greek and modern Spanish), and a newcomer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_theory">relevance theory</a>, which Goodwin uses to provide a way forward in the shadow of the KJV tradition. More on that later. In the meantime:</p>
<p>“What <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Control-Biblical-Meaning-Mechanism/dp/B008SLHBC8">Aichele</a> has noticed is that <strong>if the interpreter wants to ‘see’ the source text, he or she would prefer not to have another interpreter standing in the way. The problem with a dynamic equivalence translation, then, is that it does not permit deconstruction of the source text</strong>. The translation represents an ideological undertaking which <em>itself</em> can be readily deconstructed, but does not provide access to the source. (207-8).</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“Now, of course <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Word-God-English-Translation/dp/1581344643">Ryken and Collins</a>, whilst advocating concordant translation on the one hand, also desire, on the other hand, to maintain the control over meaning to which Aichele refers, by implicitly linking concordance to thematics. In other words, concordance is seen as desirable because it reinforces the theme (‘the message’, again) of the text, to which it is seen as a servant. They leave unexamined the question of <strong>what to do when the phenomenon of concordance might be turned <em>against</em> thematics, to undermine it — to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction">deconstruct</a> it. One man’s exegesis is, however, another’s deconstruction</strong>. <strong>A concordant translation of a text might serve equally to reveal Aichele’s ‘defects and problems’ or Ryken’s ‘full exegetical potential’ — to reinforce its ‘intention’, or to undermine it. I will argue that it does both</strong>. (208).</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“The perfect translation is the one whose relationship to a source text is such that it <strong>permits both the construction of the releveant interpretation of that text, and its deconstruction</strong>.” (209).</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first section named the sender and addressee, often including a brief greeting and “a wish for good health.”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn5"><span style="color: #000000;">[5]</span></a> Most difficult to analyze formally, the body of Hellenistic letters was flexible enough to encompass content suited to each writing’s particular communicative act.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn6"><span style="color: #000000;">[6]</span></a> Finally, “greetings to persons other than the addressee, a final greeting or prayer sentence, and sometimes a date” comprised a typical conclusion to Greco-Roman epistles.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn7"><span style="color: #000000;">[7]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In contrast to literary essays and official documents of the day, written to general audiences apart from any relational context, Paul’s letters are more private and personal – exhibiting his pastoral concern for those to whom he was a representative of Christ and an elder in the faith.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn8"><span style="color: #000000;">[8]</span></a> Nevertheless, the Pauline epistles arguably exceed their contemporaneous correspondence in length, structure, and didactic intent.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn9"><span style="color: #000000;">[9]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Although Paul understandably followed the prevailing Greco-Roman form in his own letters, he nonetheless freely adapted the epistolary conventions of the day to suit his own purposes. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, as O’Brien notes, although “on occasion the more intimate letters of the Hellenistic period began with a thanksgiving to the gods for personal benefits received,” Paul expanded and developed the introductory thanksgiving/blessing section in his writings more often than any writer of his day, yielding a mix of Hellenistic form with Jewish and Christian content which is present in most of his letters.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn10"><span style="color: #000000;">[10]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly, Paul often modified the Greco-Roman form by including a concluding paranetic section of exhortation after the body of his letters.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn11"><span style="color: #000000;">[11]</span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000analysis-of-philemonspan"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Analysis of Philemon</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">An appreciation of Pauline epistolary form in Greco-Roman context yields important interpretive insights relating to both the parts and whole of the letter to Philemon, in which Paul displays remarkable tact as he advances his request for reconciliation between Philemon and Onesimus.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn12"><span style="color: #000000;">[12]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although lacking a definite section of paranesis, the epistle is composed of </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">an opening greeting (Philem 1-3), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">thanksgiving/prayer (4-7), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">body (8-22), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">and closing (23-25).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn13"><span style="color: #000000;">[13]</span></a> </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opening-greeting">Opening Greeting</h3>
<p>Of immediate note, Paul atypically refers to himself, in the midst of an otherwise standard greeting, not as an apostle (cf. Gal 1:1) or servant (cf. Rom 1:1; Phil 1:1), but as “a prisoner of Christ Jesus” (Philem 1; NRSV) – perhaps best explained by his desire throughout “to entreat rather than command” (cf. 8-9), but also to stress Onesimus’ usefulness to him in his captivity (cf. 11-13).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn14"><span style="color: #000000;">[14]</span></a></p>
<p>Sender (“Paul…and Timothy”; Philem 1a), and addressee (“Philemon…Apphia…Archippus…and the church in your house”; 1b-2) thus identified, Paul’s signature greeting of χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη (3) functions as a benedictional transition to a section of thanksgiving and prayer (4-7), which – as elsewhere in the Pauline corpus – introduces the letter’s main themes.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn15"><span style="color: #000000;">[15]</span></a></p>
<h3 id="thanksgivingprayer">Thanksgiving/Prayer</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As Bruce notes, “the ground of the thanksgiving and the substance of the prayer are closely related to the purpose of the letter.”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn16"><span style="color: #000000;">[16]</span></a> Paul gives thanks to God because of Philemon’s love, faith, and refreshment of “the hearts of the saints” (Philem 5, 7). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The content of Paul’s subsequent prayer, then, is that “the sharing of [Philemon’s] faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ” (6; ESV). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the phrase ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου is better translated as “the mutual belonging which is proper to your faith,” referring to, as Wright puts it, “the mutuality of the Christian life which, springing from common participation in the body of Christ, extends beyond mere common concern into actual exchange” – a mutual belonging which lies at the heart of Paul’s argument and requests throughout the epistle.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn17"><span style="color: #000000;">[17]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to introducing the key themes of love/heart (cf. ἀγάπη, 4,7,9; σπλάγχνα, 7,12,20) and mutual participation (cf. κοινωνόν, 17), the thanksgiving/prayer rhetorically establishes mutual goodwill as an exordium in which Paul emphasizes characteristics of Philemon to which he can then appeal.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn18"><span style="color: #000000;">[18]</span></a></span></p>
<h3 id="body">Body</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The main request of the letter’s body – of noteworthy length in its Greco-Roman context – is that <strong>Philemon should receive Onesimus just as he would receive Paul</strong> (17b).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn19"><span style="color: #000000;">[19]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A</span><span style="color: #000000;">lthough Paul makes use of every persuasive tactic at his disposal – including concession of apostolic authority (8; 19b), emotional appeal (9, 12), pun (11), and appeal to honor (14) – the main thrust of the argument depends on the “<strong>mutual belonging</strong>” (6) between Philemon and Onesimus now that the latter has become a Christian during Paul’s captivity (10).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn20"><span style="color: #000000;">[20]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Regardless of the exact nature of the past estrangement (about which Paul remains virtually silent), Philemon is urged to interpret the seemingly unfortunate state of affairs as an opportunity for eternal reconciliation (15-16), transferring any debts that Onesimus had incurred to Paul’s own account instead (18). In receiving back Onesimus, Paul’s “very heart” (12b), as “a beloved brother” (16), Philemon would continue his refreshment of the saints’ hearts (7) by refreshing Paul’s heart (20).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn21"><span style="color: #000000;">[21]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Here, then, is an analogous microcosm of the gospel itself – a fulfillment of Paul’s prayer for κοινωνία (6) and of the cruciform “ministry of reconciliation” of 2 Corinthians 5:16-21 and Colossians 1:24-29.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn22"><span style="color: #000000;">[22]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As Wright notes, just as in Christ God reconciles the entire world to himself (2 Cor 5:19), “God is in Paul reconciling Philemon and Onesimus” – who both owed a debt, so to speak, to the apostle for their conversion (Philem 10, 19b).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn23"><span style="color: #000000;">[23]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Confident of Philemon’s compliance with his reconciliatory request (21), Paul makes an additional request for lodging based on Paul’s hope for release from imprisonment and subsequent travel to Colossae to be present with his audience (22) – an epistolary structure known as the “apostolic parousia,” revealing Paul’s consideration of his writings as substitutes for his physical presence.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn24"><span style="color: #000000;">[24]</span></a> </span></p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, Paul reports the greetings of his gospel co-workers to Philemon (23-24), before reverting to the plural to include the other addressees (2) in his concluding benediction.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn25"><span style="color: #000000;">[25]</span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000applicationspan"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Application</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If the consensus interpretation that Onesimus is Philemon’s runaway slave is correct, then Deuteronomy 23:15-16 would seem to mandate that Paul <strong>not</strong> return the fugitive to his estranged master. <a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn26"><span style="color: #000000;">[26]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the reality of their mutual belonging in Christ compelled the apostle to facilitate the reconciliation now possible due to the Messiah’s death, burial, and resurrection (cf. 2 Cor 5:16-21). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, Lightfoot reveals a potential hurdle for modern readers of this ancient text when he notes that, <strong>though “the word ‘emancipation’ seems to be trembling on [Paul’s] lips…he does not once utter it.”</strong><a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn27"><span style="color: #000000;">[27]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first step in resolving this frustration involves the clear delineation between the context of slavery in which Onesimus lived, the transatlantic slave trade of the 16<sup>th</sup> through 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, and the modern day slavery of human trafficking and forced labor – for it is far too easy to conflate the three in indignation at Paul’s failure to request Onesimus’ freedom.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn28"><span style="color: #000000;">[28]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then, once the anachronism of expecting Paul to be a modern abolitionist is noted, it can be clearly seen that, as Bruce observes, <strong>though the epistle to Philemon “throws little light on Paul’s attitude to the institution of slavery,” it brings “the institution into an atmosphere where it could only wilt and die.</strong>”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn29"><span style="color: #000000;">[29]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After all, the same κοινωνία that enabled Philemon and Onesimus to be reconciled could not help but <strong>destroy</strong> the dynamics of slavery within the kingdom of God and body of Christ – where “there is no longer slave or free,” but all are “one in Christ Jesus” (Gal 3:28). </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to the world, Onesimus belonged to Philemon as a slave. According to Christ, they belonged to one another as brothers. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although here in Philemon, as elsewhere (cf. Col 3:22-4:1), Paul stops short of prohibiting slavery, it is clear that he understood the gospel of Jesus Christ inescapably to transform the divisive condition of humanity into a restored, eternal unity which transcended all temporal divisions (cf. 1 Cor 7:17-24; Col 3:11). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Paul’s tactful requests reveal that <strong>the bond between Philemon and Onesimus as brothers in the Lord</strong> (Philem 16) <strong>was far stronger than the social expectations of master and slave.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transcending the issue of slavery – yet simultaneously striking at its very core – Paul’s masterfully crafted epistle to Philemon reminds Christians in every age to apply consistently the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ to their relationships, in spite of individualism’s siren song, which might tempt them to manipulate and dominate instead of to mutually belong to one another in κοινωνία. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, readers of Paul’s letter to Philemon should follow his peace-making example by seeking to be ministers of reconciliation in their respective contexts – no matter how discordant or seemingly insignificant. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This brief letter thus coheres with the biblical theme of <strong>unity</strong>. Because God is one, his people are called to be one as well – a community of forgiven women and men, Jews and Gentiles, even slaves and masters who forgive each other’s debts and refresh each other’s hearts in the κοινωνία of their faith in Jesus their Messiah.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn30"><span style="color: #000000;">[30]</span></a></span></p>

Aune, *The New Testament in Its Literary Environment* (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1987) 211-2 and W.W. Klein, C.L. Blomberg and R.L. Hubbard, Jr., *Introduction to Biblical Interpretation*, Rev. Ed. (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2004) 431. This paper assumes the “consensus view” of the epistle’s provenance: namely, that the apostle Paul is addressing Philemon of Colossae regarding the estranged slave and now convert, Onesimus. The creative reconstruction of J. Knox, in which the extant epistle to Philemon is the “letter from Laodicea” (Col 4:16) which was written by Paul to Archippus (Philem 2), master of Onesimus, is here ignored; cf. J. Knox, *Philemon Among the Letters of Paul* (New York: Abingdon, 1959). For critical responses to Knox’s claims from the consensus view, see F.F. Bruce, *The Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Ephesians*, NICNT (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1984) 198-202; G.B.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction-the-holy-trinity">Introduction: The Holy Trinity</h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One God. Three persons. The Holy Trinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The orthodox paradox of this Christian confession confounds many, due to its apparent contradictions, abstractions, and absence from Scripture. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From Arius to Augustine and beyond, trinitarian debates have raged even among those who agree that God exists, that the Bible is true, and that it is therefore worthwhile to consider what the Bible says because it reveals the existent God. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although the best discussions of the Trinity begin with an acknowledgment of its inscrutable mystery which eludes the grasp of human reason’s highest reach, a sober analysis of the doctrine’s canonical presence and historical outworking may help to answer the charges that the Trinity is a nonsensical, unbiblical abstraction worthy of abandonment. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although it is precisely the Trinity’s classical formulation that receives the criticisms just noted, it is important to begin at the end, so to speak, by introducing the operative terms before analyzing the scriptural context <em>out of which</em> and the historical context <em>in which</em> these trinitarian terms grew. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The definitive statement of trinitarian belief is the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 CE, discussed below.<a href="#sdfootnote1sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>1</sup></span></a> In brief, however, Christians confess belief in one God who eternally and only exists in one divine substance, essence, or <em>ousia</em>, and in three divine subsistences, Persons, or <em>hypostases</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote2sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>2</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One in three, three in one: Father, Son, and Spirit – each Person equally and essentially God, and yet each distinct from the other two.</span></p>
<p>(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/">Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?</a>“)</p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000is-the-trinity-in-the-bible--canonical-presencespan"><span style="color: #000000;">Is the Trinity in the Bible? – Canonical Presence</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A common objection to the doctrine of the Trinity as just stated is that it nowhere appears within the pages of Scripture. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And indeed, despite the favorite trinitarian proof-texts in which Father, Son, and Spirit appear together, “no doctrine of the Trinity in the Nicene sense is present in [even] the New Testament.”<a href="#sdfootnote3sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>3</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, as Jenson persuasively argues, “the doctrine of the Trinity is indeed in Scripture, <em>if</em> one abandons modernity’s notion that statement in so many words as formulated is the only way that a doctrine can appear there.”<a href="#sdfootnote4sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></a> Instead, the <em>narrative</em> of Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.”<a href="#sdfootnote5sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>5</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">These three <em>dramatis personae Dei</em>, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a <em>persona</em> in Israel’s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.”<a href="#sdfootnote6sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>6</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">YHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the Father by virtue of Jesus’ address of him as such.<a href="#sdfootnote7sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Son is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address, but also in light of passages such as Psalm 2, appropriated in Hebrews 1 to identify Jesus as the divine Son.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>8</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, the Spirit appears as a <em>persona</em> of the story, first in the OT as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the NT as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>9</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The significance of trinitarian “proof-texts” mentioned above is that they portray the three persons of the divine drama in close proximity. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Most significant of these is the baptismal formula of Matthew 28:19, spoken by the Son himself: “…baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Although the earliest Christians used poignant trinitarian phrases before the full implications of such had been thoroughly considered, these biblical patterns provided “the raw data from which the more developed descriptions of the Christian doctrine of God [would] come.”<a href="#sdfootnote10sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The classical formulation of the Trinity did not arise from a scriptural vacuum.</span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000how-did-we-get-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity--historical-outworkingspan"><span style="color: #000000;">How did we get the “doctrine” of the Trinity? – Historical Outworking</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Neither was the doctrine formed in a historical vacuum. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Instead, as Wainwright notes: “the classic creeds were being formulated at the same time as the canon of the Scriptures was being recognized and determined; there was interaction between the two processes, and the Scriptures and the creeds continue to function reciprocally.”<a href="#sdfootnote11sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>11</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The ecumenical creeds – such as the Apostles’, Niceno-Constantinopolitan (381), and the Chalcedonian <em>Definitio Fidei</em> (451) – serve as an interpretive key to the complex Scriptures, and yet also distill the divine drama of the Bible into a concise summary.<a href="#sdfootnote12sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>12</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A crucial facet of trinitarian doctrine in which this dialectic took place was the distinction between the <em>immanent</em> and the <em>economic</em> Trinity – the former referring to the Trinity within itself, and the latter referring to the Trinity’s external relationship to the universe. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">While the majority of Scripture provides portrayals of the economic Trinity interacting with creation, it also offers enticing glimpses into the immanent relationships between the persons of the divine drama.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>13</sup></span></a> The doctrine that developed from such glimpses offered a way of distinguishing between how God relates to himself and to everything else, but also concluded that “the immanent Trinity lives no other plot than that displayed in the economic Trinity, that when you are taken into the story told in Scripture, you are taken into God himself.”<a href="#sdfootnote14sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>14</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In other words, “there is no deeper reality of God lurking in the background” behind the three Persons of the Godhead.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>15</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although many of the disagreements took place before the distinction between the economic and immanent Trinity was formalized, the contours of the historical trinitarian debates revolve around where the conceptual boundary lies between the two.<a href="#sdfootnote16sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>16</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A concern for the preservation of God’s <em>unity</em> motivated many of the early controversies. For example, Paul of Samosata collapsed the immanent Trinity to the Father alone, pushing the Son and Spirit into the economy, in their respective relations to the human being Jesus and the apostles – the view known as adoptionism.<a href="#sdfootnote17sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>17</sup></span></a> Similarly, Sabellius pushed all three divine Persons into the economy, positing that the immanent Godhead was one God who exists in three modes or roles of being to the external creation – the view known as modalism.<a href="#sdfootnote18sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>18</sup></span></a> </span><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, it was Arius’s commitment to monotheism that led him to shrink the immanent Trinity down to the Father alone – concluding that, because God is the indivisible cause of all that exists, he must have existed prior to the Son, who is “not everlasting or co-everlasting or unbegotten with the Father.”<a href="#sdfootnote19sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>19</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although each of these views would ultimately find condemnation in the creeds of the Church, it was Arius’s conception of a created Son that ignited the controversy that led to the Council of Nicaea (325), which refuted Arianism by declaring that the Son is “begotten, not made, being of one substance [<em>homoousios</em>] with the Father.”<a href="#sdfootnote20sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>20</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the trinitarian debates continued, in part because of the relative ambiguity of the term homoousios and the ability of different factions to interpret it as they wished.<a href="#sdfootnote21sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>21</sup></span></a> The years between the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople (381) were theologically chaotic as Athanasius of Alexandria and the Cappadocian fathers (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa) fought for the Nicene view of the Trinity against its detractors, Arian and otherwise.<a href="#sdfootnote22sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>22</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, along the lines of Arius’s original concerns, if the Son and the Spirit are granted full divinity along with the Father (as they are in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed), why do Christians confess one God and not three? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Gregory of Nyssa addressed these concerns first by appealing to the differences between the trinitarian terms <em>ousia</em> (common essence) and <em>hypostasis</em> (distinct personal subsistence). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Belonging to the category of collective or common nouns – which unite by referring to the common nature shared by diverse members of the same category – <em>ousia</em> refers to the divine essence or substance, shared equally by the three <em>hypostases</em> of the Godhead so that they are properly <em>homoousioi</em>, or of the same substance, with one another.<a href="#sdfootnote23sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>23</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, belonging to the category of individual or proper nouns – which distinguish by referring to only one member of a particular category – <em>hypostasis</em> refers to the individual identity or subsistence of each divine Person which demarcates it from the other two.<a href="#sdfootnote24sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>24</sup></span></a> </span><span style="color: #000000;">The divine <em>hypostases</em> are distinguishable in that “the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are one in all things save in the being unbegotten [Father], the being begotten [Son], and the procession [Spirit].”<a href="#sdfootnote25sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>25</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The distinction between a common <em>ousia</em> and distinct <em>hypostases</em>, therefore, prevents the collapse of the Trinity, yet through a crucial difference between the distinction-in-unity with regard to humanity and with regard to the divine. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After all, it is difficult to ascertain the unifying <em>ousia</em> of humanity because the distinct <em>hypostases</em> both appear and behave in such discordant ways. Due to their myriad differences and a merely conceptual unity, humans are not properly referred to as one human but many. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In contrast, the unity of the three divine <em>hypostases</em> is actual, by virtue of the trinitarian rule <em>opera trinitatis ad extra indivisa sunt</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote26sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>26</sup></span></a> As Gregory of Nyssa notes, “every activity which pervades from God to creation and is named according to our manifold design starts off from the Father, proceeds through the Son, and is completed by the Holy Spirit.”<a href="#sdfootnote27sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>27</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Christians worship one God, because although each divine Person is God, “by the same proclamation God is one, because neither in regard to nature [or ousia] nor activity is any difference viewed.”<a href="#sdfootnote28sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>28</sup></span></a> Unlike the diverse and discordant human <em>hypostases</em>, the divine persons are completely unified in their will and operations. Therefore, in the words of Gregory of Nazianzus: “the Godhead exists undivided in beings divided.”<a href="#sdfootnote29sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>29</sup></span></a></span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000conclusionspan"><span style="color: #000000;">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To return to what was mentioned at the outset, the best discussions of the Trinity also <em>end</em> with an acknowledgment of its inherent mystery which eludes the grasp of human reason’s highest reach. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Theological modesty is always in order, in part because of the unavoidable limitations of finite human speech about <em>anything</em>, much less about the infinite God. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Granted, certain ways of framing how God can be one and yet three are better than others, not only based upon their coherence with the traditions of orthodoxy, but also with regard to their impact on other areas of theological concern – such as the atonement and interpersonal relationships.<a href="#sdfootnote30sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>30</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And yet, because true theology is not learning how to speak about God in order to master him intellectually, but in order to worship him faithfully, a persistent lacuna in trinitarian understanding is surely acceptable. For, although the gracious condescension of the triune God enables our faith to seek understanding successfully, the inscrutable mysteries of the same triune God ensure that some understandings will ever transcend our faith’s reach.</span></p>

<p><a href="#sdfootnote4anc">4</a> Jenson, 197. Emphasis original.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote5anc">5</a> Jenson, 199. The divinity of the Father is perhaps the easiest to note throughout the Bible. On the divinity of the Son, see John 1, 10; Col. 2; Phil. 2; and Heb. 1. On the divinity of the Spirit, see 1 Cor. 2:11; Heb. 3:7-10; and 10:15-17. I have here stuck to the contours of Jenson’s argument in lieu of the common arguments for the divinity of Son and Spirit, e.g.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote6anc">6</a> Jenson, 198-202. The phrase “dramatis personae Dei” is Jenson’s adaptation of Tertullian’s verbiage.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote7anc">7</a>Cf. John 5:16-23; Jenson, 199. Although this is almost assuredly an oversimplification, cf. Marshall’s claim that “the Father is the God of Israel, the Son is the God of Israel, and the Holy Spirit is the God of Israel, yet they are not three Gods of Israel, but one God of Israel.” B. Marshall, “Do Christians Worship the God of Israel” in <em>Knowing the Triune God</em> (ed. J. Buckley and D. Yeago; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001), 258; quoted by Wainwright, 817. However, Jenson’s main point still stands, by virtue of Jesus’ address to the Father establishing both Fatherhood and Sonship within the Trinity.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote8anc">8</a> Cf. Ps. 2:7; Heb. 1:1-14. In addition, Jenson (200-3) focuses on showing the presence of the Trinity in the OT, where it is so often neglected, by positing that the Son shows up via the themes of the angel of the Lord, the name of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord..</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote9anc">9</a>Jenson, 199, 204; cf. Gen. 1:2; Ps. 51:11; Isa. 11:2; Ezek. 37:1-14; John 14:15-31; Acts 1:7-8; 2:1-41; Rom. 1:4; 8:11.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote10anc">10</a> Rusch, 2. Gregory of Nazianzus captures the progressive nature of this scriptural trinitarian revelation well: “the old covenant made clear proclamation of the Father, a less definite one of the Son. The new covenant made the Son manifest, and gave us a glimpse of the Spirit’s Godhead. At the present time, the Spirit resides amongst us, giving us a clearer manifestation of himself than before.” See Gregory of Nazianzus, Fifth Theological Oration (Oration 31): On the Holy Spirit, 14, in <em>On God and Christ: The Five Theological Orations and Two Letters to Cledonius</em> (Popular Patristics Series 23; trans.

<p><span style="color:#000000;">As the first royal psalm of the Psalter, Psalm 2 exhorts rebellious world leaders to serve Yahweh in wisdom by submitting to his anointed Davidic king who has been granted a global kingdom.<a href="#sdfootnote1sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>1</sup></span></a> Comprehension of the psalm’s original message first requires an examination of its constituent parts, with an eye toward its poetic features and original context. Furthermore, an understanding of the enduring significance of Psalm 2 necessitates a consideration of its canonical and redemptive-historical context, including the New Testament’s typological interpretations of the passage. This essay will provide both aspects before concluding with a brief discussion of how best to interpret and apply Psalm 2 to the contemporary Christian Church. </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor000000original-messagespan"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Original Message</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Psalm 2 is arranged in four stanzas of three verses each that follow a loosely chiastic movement from the rebellious rulers of nations (2:1-3), to Yahweh (2:4-6), to his anointed king (2:7-9), and back to the rulers (2:10-12).<a href="#sdfootnote2sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>2</sup></span></a> The psalmist opens with a twofold rhetorical question that uses synthetic parallelism to express indignant astonishment at the nations’ rage (2:1a) and the peoples’ vain plots (2:1b).<a href="#sdfootnote3sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>3</sup></span></a> The rest of the first stanza clarifies the scene: the “kings” and “rulers” of the earth are rebelliously conspiring “against the Lord and against his Anointed” (2:2), using the metaphor of “bonds” and “cords” in their reported direct speech (2:3) to express comparatively the implied rule of the Israelite king.<a href="#sdfootnote4sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></a> The second stanza shifts the focus upward from the limited earthly sphere of influence of the rebellious kings to the unlimited heavenly kingdom of Yahweh (2:4), who anthropomorphically responds to their machinations with laughter and derision, “just as humans would mock something ridiculous.”<a href="#sdfootnote5sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>5</sup></span></a> As Ross notes, the two verbs “he will speak” and “[he will] terrify them” (2:5) are respectively a metonymy of cause and of effect to portray the full divine response, arranged in chiastic order (“speak + wrath // anger + terrify”) to emphasize God’s wrath.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>6</sup></span></a> At the heart of the passage’s chiastic structure, bridging the second and third stanzas, is a dramatic shift of scene from Yahweh speaking while seated in the heavens (2:4-6) to Mount Zion and the Davidic king’s recounting of the divine decree (2:7). Both divine speeches emphasize that the authority of Israel’s king proceeds from his divine installation and sonship.<a href="#sdfootnote7sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></a> As Mays notes, although the human ruler in view is not equal or identical to the deity, this unique appearance in the Psalter of “son” as the Davidic king’s title (cf. 2 Sam 7:14) reveals the close correspondence between God and the king.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>8</sup></span></a> This powerful polemic against the rulers who would dare to rebel against such an authoritative king continues through the third stanza (2:7-9), where the son/king is granted a global kingdom (2:8), described with synonymous parallelism between (1) the “nations” and “ends of the earth” and (2) “your heritage” and “your possession.” The section concludes with a vivid image, utilizing “a rod of iron” as a metaphor for the Davidic king’s divinely-granted authority and “like a potter’s vessel” as a simile for the relative vulnerability of the rulers of nations sans divine installation and protection.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>9</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> In the final stanza (2:10-12), the psalmist appropriately begins with “now therefore,” a common phrase from Hebrew wisdom literature, before exhorting the rebellious kings and rulers of the earth to “be wise” (2:10) by serving the Lord in reverential fear (2:11) and submitting to his anointed son/king (2:12a).<a href="#sdfootnote10sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></a> The urgency of the exhortations is “met by the warning that <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">he</span></em> may be angry” (2:12b-c).<a href="#sdfootnote11sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>11</sup></span></a> The ambiguity of the subject (“he”) of the descriptions of anger in these two clauses serves to illustrate the close link between Yahweh and his king throughout the entire psalm. As Ross rightly notes, the result of either interpretive option would be the same – “the king will put down their rebellion, but it will be God giving him the victory. To rebel against the one is to rebel against both, and to submit to one is to submit to both.”<a href="#sdfootnote12sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>12</sup></span></a> The psalmist concludes by promising blessing to those who take refuge in “him” (2:12d) – an again ambiguous referent, but contextually describing those who demonstrate reverential faith for Yahweh by submitting to his anointed king.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>13</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Contextually, the parallels between this passage and the promises spoken to David in 2 Samuel 7:8-16 clarify the content by identifying the psalm with the coronation of a Davidic king, in addition to the Davidic covenant’s continuity with the other covenant commitments of Yahweh throughout the OT.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>14</sup></span></a> Despite Gunn’s creative proposal that Psalm 2 refers to the anointing and not the coronation of the king, Ross offers a balanced perspective when he views the psalm’s original occasion as a time of crisis due to the vulnerability of the nation to foreign attack at the time of a new king’s coronation.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>15</sup></span></a> Within the Psalter itself, Psalm 2 comprises an introduction along with Psalm 1 – focusing “on the victory of the LORD’s anointed king over the nations” after Psalm 1’s emphasis on the wise way of the righteous.<a href="#sdfootnote16sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>16</sup></span></a> Because the final editing and compilation of the Psalter took place in absence of a Davidic king, this fitting introduction “served as a reminder of God’s plan” to its earliest audiences.<a href="#sdfootnote17sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>17</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> However, as VanGemeren rightly emphasizes, “the juxtaposition of Psalm 3 [a Davidic lament psalm] with Psalms 1 and 2 creates a sense of dissonance” which refocuses “the hope of the godly from David to the Lord, who has made the promises to David.”<a href="#sdfootnote18sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>18</sup></span></a> That is, the tension between the idealized portraits (of the individual and Davidic king) in the first two Psalms, the “canonical understanding of the failure of David and of the Davidic dynasty,” and the “real world of failure and exile” experienced throughout the rest of the Psalter and Hebrew Bible encourages a christological and eschatological reading – one which looks for the fulfillment of the expectations of Israel and David in a coming anointed king who is both Son of David and Son of God.<a href="#sdfootnote19sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>19</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor000000enduring-significancespan"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Enduring Significance</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It is reasonable to assume that Psalm 2’s uniqueness as the only psalm to use “son” as a title for the Davidic king and the only OT combination of “anointed/messiah,” “king,” and “son” in one passage contributed to its frequent use in the NT.<a href="#sdfootnote20sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>20</sup></span></a> The redemptive-historical context of the second psalm suggests its meaningful relevance (1) during the Hebrew monarchy when a Davidic king was on the throne, (2) during the post-exilic absence of a king, and (3) as the psalm’s circle of context extended into the New Testament and the nascent Church – taking on a typological significance in its portrayal of the anointed Davidic king as the <em>type</em> of which Jesus the Messiah was the <em>antitype</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote21sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>21</sup></span></a> Based on the NT evidence, as VanGemeren notes, “from the perspective of typology, Jesus is the fulfillment of the psalm,” because “he is born of David’s lineage (Mt 1:1; Lk 2:4, 11), has a right to David’s throne (Lk 1:32), is the Son of God in a unique way (Mt 3:17; Lk 9:35; Heb 1:5), and will ultimately subdue all enemies under his feet (1Co 15:25-27; Heb 2:5-8).”<a href="#sdfootnote22sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>22</sup></span></a> Although a full discussion of messianic typological interpretation exceeds the purview of this paper, a discussion of the quotations of Psalm 2 in Acts 4:25-26 and twice in Hebrews (1:5 and 5:5) will suffice to demonstrate the NT sensitivity to the contours of God’s redemptive mission and the uniqueness of his Messiah – an awareness which contemporary interpretative methods should embody.<a href="#sdfootnote23sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>23</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Following the reprimand and release of Peter and John from the Sanhedrin (Acts 4:1-23), the believers to whom they are reunited quote Psalm 2:1-2 (Acts 4:25-26) as they confess to God (4:24) a poignant interpretation of the resistance the anointed king of Psalm 2 faced from the “Gentiles,” “peoples,” “kings,” and “rulers” (4:25-26) in terms of the lethal opposition Jesus received from “Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel” (4:27). Of note is the intimate awareness of not only the content but also the eschatological bent of Psalm 2 that such a typological interpretation of the text required. In a profound interpretive dialectic, familiarity with the passage’s unmet expectations, the patterns of God’s redemptive work, and the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus enabled these believers to bring Psalm 2 to bear on the very resistance their messianic interpretations were creating for themselves.<a href="#sdfootnote24sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>24</sup></span></a> Because Psalm 2 teaches that “the declaration of the Son of God is God’s answer to the opposition of the world’s powers,” the early Christians used the passage to bolster their proclamation of the gospel in the face of external threats, not by directly identifying themselves with Psalm 2’s Davidic king, but by taking refuge in him, so to speak, by proclaiming their experience of the passage’s unique fulfillment in the person of Jesus and trusting in Yahweh’s promised blessing (Ps 2:12).<a href="#sdfootnote25sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>25</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The uniqueness of Jesus’ fulfillment of the second psalm is further accentuated in the quotation of Psalm 2:7 at Hebrews 1:5a and 5:5. The former quotation follows immediately after the introduction to the epistle (1:1-4), and is paired with a quotation of 2 Samuel 7:14 (Heb 1:5b) in order to emphasize the Son’s superiority to the angels, a theme which is then carried forward through a litany of OT quotations which collectively emphasize the same point.<a href="#sdfootnote26sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>26</sup></span></a> The latter occurrence of Psalm 2:7 (Heb 5:5) is the first use of an OT passage in the lengthy central discussion of the priesthood of Christ in Hebrews 5:1-10:18, explaining his appointment as high priest in terms of his divine sonship – with an emphasis on the humility of one who “did not exalt himself,” (5:5a) but rather was installed by God. In answer to those who would overlook the Son’s unique status, both uses of Psalm 2:7 together emphasize that “the same one who exalted the Son above the angels (Heb. 1:5) has also glorified him to become high priest (5:1-9).”<a href="#sdfootnote27sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>27</sup></span></a> Significantly, the typological use of Psalm 2 in terms of Jesus Christ’s fulfillment as antitype coheres with the central point of the passage in its original context: the indissoluble link between Yahweh and his anointed son/king.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> The interpretation of Psalm 2 in the contemporary Christian context should demonstrate the same sensitivity the NT does to the contours of God’s redemptive mission and the uniqueness of his Messiah. This does not denigrate the passage’s relevance to Christians today, but rather guards against identifying oneself with the king of Psalm 2 and usurping the uniqueness of God’s Son in the desire for authority, blessing, and protection. Although Klein, Blomberg, and Hubbard claim that “royal psalms [such as Psalm 2] relate best to the modern counterparts of Israel’s kings: the leaders of the Christian community,” this approach, seems to risk a gross misinterpretation of the passage if Christian leaders fail to show due concern for the uniqueness of Jesus as the passage’s fulfillment.<a href="#sdfootnote28sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>28</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Instead, interpretations of Psalm 2 best emphasize the “crucial inherent differences between monarchs and church leaders” when they cohere with the passage’s original exhortation to demonstrate wisdom by submitting to God’s authoritative and anointed king.<a href="#sdfootnote29sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>29</sup></span></a> This is a warning to those who rebel against God by neglecting the authority of his anointed king – either by spurning him or, perhaps even more dangerously, by trying to take his place.<a href="#sdfootnote30sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>30</sup></span></a> Christian leaders need to heed this warning just as much as anyone else. And yet Psalm 2 is simultaneously an encouraging comfort to those who follow Jesus the Messiah as the King of Kings, especially in times of fierce opposition when the future of God’s mission seems most vulnerable. The promised global kingdom (Ps 2:8-9) will one day be fully given to the Son of David who is the Son of God – and although the rulers of this world will continue to rise up against Yahweh and his king, those who take refuge in the Son (and therefore in Yahweh himself) will still receive the promised blessing (Ps 2:12) as faithful citizens of the Son’s kingdom.</span></p>

The Davidic covenant of 2 Sam 7 stands in elaborating continuity with the Abrahamic (Gen 12-17) and Mosaic (Exod 19-24) covenants, and is itself intensified and elaborated upon in the “new covenant” of Jer 31. This context of covenantal continuity is extremely important to the interpretation of Ps 2 because, without it, Yahweh’s exclusive, close relationship with the king (Ps 2:4-12) is inexplicable.</span>
</div><div id="sdfootnote15"><span style="color:#000000;">[<span style="color:#000000;">15</span>](#sdfootnote15anc) Ross, *Psalms*, 200. <span style="font-size:small;">VanGemeren rightly notes that “any attempt to link the psalm with an actual coronation of a Judean king…finds little support in the text.” VanGemeren, </span><span style="font-size:small;">*Psalms*</span><span style="font-size:small;">, 89. </span>Gunn’s proposal, while heeding VanGemeren’s caution and offering a creative explanation of the already-not-yet dimensions of Jesus Christ’s current kingly reign, seems more driven by the concerns of a presupposed eschatological system than by a straightforward exegesis of the passage at hand. Although the gap between David’s anointing as king (1 Sam 16) and his coronation as such (2 Sam 2, 5) is instructive for considerations of the Hebrew monarchy, it does not mean that such a gap was normative for the kingly sons of David for whom the psalm at hand was probably composed. Furthermore, there are other, better ways to explain the unique kingdom reign of Christ during the current age than this kind of artificial reverse interpretation of Psalm 2. See Gunn, “Psalm 2,” 431-2.</span>

Mays, *Psalms*, 40,7. According to the *UBS Greek New Testament*, 4<sup>th</sup> Rev. Ed. (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2001) 887,95, Psalm 2 is quoted in the NT at Acts 4:25-26 (Ps 2:1-2); 13:33; Heb 1:5, and 5:5 (Ps 2:7). Furthermore, there are allusions and verbal parallels to Psalm 2 at Mt 3:17; 17:5; Mk 1:11; 9:7; Lk 3:22; 9:35; Jn 1:49 (Ps 2:7); Heb 1:2 (Ps 2:8); Rev 11:18 (Ps 2:1); and 19:19 (Ps 2:2). Gunn notes that “based on New Testament quotations, allusions, and verbal parallels, Psalm 2 is one of the most frequently referred to of all the psalms.” Gunn, “Psalm 2,” 427.</span>

Hubbard, Jr., *Introduction to Biblical Interpretation*, Rev. Ed. (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2004) 183.

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The written Word of God is, therefore, the authority for followers of the living Word of God precisely because of its providential role in the divine speech-act, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>3</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Practically, this providential role has worked itself out in various ways throughout the history of the Church, perhaps most notably through the development of canon in the patristic era. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Theologically, the authority of Scripture is inescapably <strong>trinitarian</strong> in nature and <strong>ecclesiological</strong> in implication.</span></p>
<p>(For an explanation of the Trinity, see my essay “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/">Trinity: What is it? (Why) Is it important?</a>“)</p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000what-scripture-is-for-christiansspan"><span style="color: #000000;">WHAT SCRIPTURE IS FOR CHRISTIANS</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For Christians, Scripture is the indispensable lens through which, with the Spirit’s illumination, we view Christ, who is himself the fullest lens through which we view the Godhead. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, the Bible is a vital link in the revelatory chain which includes Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and humanity. However, the Bible’s role <em>in</em> and <em>for</em> the Church is inescapably intertwined with (1) how the Bible came to be and (2) how it is properly to be accessed and interpreted.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000how-the-bible-came-to-bespan"><span style="color: #000000;">How the Bible Came to Be</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although the story of how the table of contents at the beginning of each Christian Bible came into existence is an old one, questions of <em>canon</em> in this sense did not arise immediately after Christ’s resurrection and ascension.<a href="#sdfootnote4sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The earliest Christians, persuaded that Jesus of Nazareth was the foretold Messiah of Israel, eagerly adopted the Hebrew Scriptures, or <em>Tanakh</em>, as their own Scripture. Apart from the Bible’s narrative of YHWH’s redemptive mission with his covenant people, the Christ-event (life, death, and resurrection) made little sense. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the other direction, however, the early Church believed that, as the fulfillment of the <em>Tanakh</em>, Christ himself was its true message. Put differently, the Hebrew Scriptures and the Son of God were considered reciprocally-interpretive, and this relationship was the first sense in which canon was considered as “the rule of truth”: the Christ-event and the Scriptures illuminate each other.<a href="#sdfootnote5sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>5</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The link between this earliest consideration of canon and the table-of-contents approach begins with the role proclamation and confession of the Son of God as the Bible’s true meaning – of the Gospel of Christ <em>according to the Scriptures</em> – have in creating the Church proper (cf. 1 Cor. 15:1-9).<a href="#sdfootnote6sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>6</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because Christians are primarily interested in bringing people to faith in the faithful God through Christ, the proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Word of God constitutes the Church as the divinely-ordained way in which faith is brought about (cf. Rom. 10:17). To use a spatial metaphor, this ecclesial “point” of proclamation becomes a “line” throughout history by <em>tradition</em> as “the act of passing down” and “the content of what is passed down.”<a href="#sdfootnote7sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Church is thus formed by proclamation/confession of Jesus the Messiah according to the Scriptures, and preserved by tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the second century C.E., Irenaeus of Lyons relied upon the connection between Scripture and apostolic tradition to refute Gnostic heresies which threatened to destabilize the Christian community by, among other things, insisting that Scripture could not be read at face value.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>8</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This connection was so strong that he referred to the “traditioned” teachings of the apostles as <em>in scripturis</em>, responding to those who accused these apostolic “Writings” of novel fiction by delineating the unity of Christian doctrine which had been passed down from the apostles (eyewitnesses of the Christ-event) to the Church through a clear line of bishops.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>9</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was of crucial importance to Irenaeus that Christian doctrine was (1) unified and (2) in direct continuity with the apostles’ teaching (and therefore with the proclamation of Christ and the Christologically-fulfilled expectations of the Hebrew Scriptures).<a href="#sdfootnote10sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the Gnostic controversies of the second century led to canonization in its second sense: the Church’s recognition/acknowledgment of writings which already had authority due to their coherence with the complex dialectic between Scripture, the Christ-event, the apostles, proclamation, and tradition.<a href="#sdfootnote11sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>11</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Canon’s final sense, as a list of included and excluded books which comprise the Bible, came into being in the fourth century. The Church’s recognition of already authoritative writings culminated in C.E. 367 with the <em>Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle</em> of Athanasius – the first canon list to include “all, and nothing but, all [sic] the books of our New Testament.”<a href="#sdfootnote12sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>12</sup></span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000scriptures-proper-interpretation-and-rolespan"><span style="color: #000000;">Scripture’s Proper Interpretation and Role</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In interacting with the Word of God, it is imperative that the people of God resist the impulse to jump behind the text – either to a Gnostic-inspired and disembodied spiritual narrative, or to historical criticism’s rationalistic insistence on verifiable facts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Properly handled, the Bible results in the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in order to produce faith in the faithful God.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Arguably, the best interpretive method accounts for both Christ as the fullest truth of Scripture and the varied ways in which the Bible has been used by God through his Spirit to accomplish his redemptive mission in manifold ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, in terms of my thesis above, the best biblical hermeneutic accounts for both the central locution (Christ) and the varied perlocutionary effects accomplished in/through the Church by the Spirit throughout history.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It does not leave Christ behind in its insistence on esoteric behind-the-text matters, nor does it refuse the Spirit its right to bring the written Word to bear on the interpreter’s present context in fresh ways. In this way, interpretation of the Bible leads to faith through the faithful proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Scriptures.</span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000scriptures-own-authorityspan"><span style="color: #000000;">SCRIPTURE’S OWN AUTHORITY</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned above, Scripture’s authority comes from its providential role in the speech-act of God, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, although the illocutionary acts of the Bible are an indispensable link in the revelatory chain, they do not comprise the entire chain. Any discussion of Scripture’s authority must, therefore, take place with its discursive context in mind, by including a discussion of the Christological locution and Spirit-empowered, ecclesiological perlocutionary effects of the divine speech-act.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Christologically, the illocutionary acts of the written Word of God bear witness to Christ the living Word as their central meaning: the ultimate locution of God. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Jesus himself never shied away from claiming that he was the fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures (Matt. 5:17; Lk. 24:25-27, 44). Indeed, he chastised the Jewish leaders for thoroughly studying the Scriptures, yet failing to see that the <em>Tanakh</em> bore witness to him (John 5:39-40)! </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, in Acts, Peter (3:11-26), Stephen (7:1-53), and Paul (13:16-41) all portray Christ as the fulfillment of YHWH’s previous interactions with Israel in the <em>Tanakh</em>. The written Word of God is authoritative in that it bears witness to the Living Word as the zenith of God’s redemptive revelation – the “image of the invisible God” in whom “the fulness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col. 1:15, 19, ESV).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When the Bible speaks of its own authority, it never does so apart from the life of the faithful, the Church. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The two favorite passages for the inspiration (and often, the inerrancy) of Scripture both refuse to reduce the Bible to a set of propositions to be debated within a correspondence theory of truth. The Scriptures were “breathed out by God,” not to be profitable for scientific analysis, but for “reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16, ESV). Furthermore, “men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit,” (2 Pet. 1:21, ESV) for the sake of the people of God, that they might know Christ (2 Pet. 1:12-21). Arguably, then, the ties between inspiration and sanctification are stronger than those between inspiration and certain common notions of inerrancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At this intersection between the inspired illocutionary acts of Scripture and their perlocutionary effects lies the Spirit of God, who empowers the “inscripturate” Word to become “incardiate,” or “taken to heart” by God’s people.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>13</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Pneumatologically, then, the Bible is able both to <em>be</em> and <em>become</em> the Word of God, as its written words are used in various ways by the Spirit throughout the ages to effect God’s mission of redemption <em>in</em> and <em>through</em> his people.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>14</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The christological, ecclesiological, and pneumatological elements of the divine speech-act thus enable the written Word continually to be an indispensable part of divine discourse, instead of a merely static word.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>15</sup></span></a></span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000conclusionspan"><span style="color: #000000;">CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout the ages, God has used his Word – living and written – to do everything from creating the world, to redeeming it; from calling a people, to establishing orthodoxy and orthopraxy in his Church; from inspiring reformation, to drawing people from every tribe, tongue, and nation to himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In order best to appropriate the written Word of God and submit to its continuing authority in their lives, the people of God should focus on proclaiming its central message as the Gospel of Jesus Christ and allowing the Holy Spirit to accomplish fresh perlocutionary effects <em>in</em> and <em>through</em> them as God’s redemptive mission moves toward its consummation – when the written Word of God will be in their hearts and the living Word of God in front of their faces, forever (Jer. 31:33-34; Rev. 21-22).</span></p>

<div id="sdfootnote1">[1](#sdfootnote1anc) Unless otherwise noted, I use the terms “Son of God,” “Jesus,” “Christ/Messiah,” and permutations thereof interchangeably. The same applies to “Scripture” and “Bible.”
</div><div id="sdfootnote2">[2](#sdfootnote2anc) I here adopt J.L. Austin’s speech-act theory, as put forth in How to Do Things with Words (2nd ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975). Briggs offers the following helpful summary: “Austin sought to distinguish between the act performed in saying something and the act performed by saying something, labeling these ‘illocutionary’ and ‘perlocutionary’ acts respectively.” See Richard S. Briggs, “Speech-Act Theory” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 763. I am also heavily indebted to Kevin J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The Gospel is more than a checklist, more than a five-minute “yes-or-no” conversation in which you can make a new Christian… its a narrative of cosmic significance. If God really is reconciling <em><strong>all things</strong></em> to himself in and through Jesus Christ, then everything we do and say, ESPECIALLY when we’re speaking of the Gospel, must change.</p>

She blogs at <https://amyechase.wordpress.com/>. </address>---
<h2 id="jeremiah-2911">Jeremiah 29:11</h2>
<p>When I accepted the invitation to speak at my parents’ church, I immediately started thinking about what message I would deliver. I decided to give a message on something that is very important to me after my four years at <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/">Cedarville</a> and something I am very passionate about. I hope it will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">engaging</span>; I hope it will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make you think</span>; and I hope it will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bring glory to God</span>. If I can accomplish those three things, I will be satisfied.</p>
<p>The Scripture I chose is Jeremiah 29:11 and I’m guessing that most Christians could recite the verse from memory. If not, once you read it, you’ll probably remember or recognize it.</p>
<p><em><strong>“’For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.’”</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a familiar verse for a lot of Christians. My question today is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether it should be</span>.</p>
<p>This might seem like a strange question, but I think you’ll understand what I mean soon.</p>
<p>So why is this verse so familiar to us? Well, it’s used a lot. Are you nervous about future uncertainties? <em>Jeremiah 29:11</em>. Are you starting a new job?  <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Graduating from high school or college? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> That teenage girl had her boyfriend break up with her? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Car trouble that makes you late to work? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Lost your lucky pencil? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em></p>
<p>I hope you’re catching my sarcasm.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://rlv.zcache.com/jeremiah_29_11_i_know_the_plans_bible_verse_denim_keychain-r143db7130dbe4fb3a239db30a4aeef88_x7j3z_8byvr_512.jpg" alt=""  />
And maybe you think I’m exaggerating. But I did a Google search for Jeremiah 29:11 and you can buy folders, clocks, plaques, keychains, mugs, pictures, bumper stickers, aprons, tote bags, iPhone cases, tshirts, pillows, bracelets, and even playing cards that have this verse on them. It might be rivaling the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023&amp;version=NET">23rd Psalm</a> after all that. And I know for a fact that it can be found on countless greeting cards whether they be sympathy, graduation, engagement, or congratulatory cards.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/this-is-not-a-bag-of-trail-mix-you-cant-just-pick-out-the-p.png" alt="- this is not a bag of trail mix you cant just pick out the p"  />
</p>
<p>I saw a meme on the internet the other day. It was an image of the Bible, and the text said: “This is not a bag of trail mix. You can’t just pick out the pieces you like and ignore the rest.” I’m afraid that the widespread use of Jeremiah 29:11 demonstrates a bigger problem: we really are guilty of treating the Bible like a bag of trail mix. Jeremiah 29:11 is an M&amp;M that we pull out time and time again while we ignore all the peanuts and raisins and cashews and granola all around it.</p>
<p>Christians claim to have a high view of Scripture—that is, we say that the Bible is the authoritative, divinely inspired Word of God. We are quick to use it to tell the world what they’re doing wrong whether that be gay marriage or murder or how to raise children. We say that we live by what the Bible says, but I’m afraid that we’re often guilty of not even knowing what the Bible says. For me, the widespread use of Jeremiah 29:11 proves this.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, does anyone know what Jeremiah 29:10 says? No, because it’s a peanut. Jeremiah 29:12? Sorry, I don’t like raisins. But I am feeling uncertain about this new job/relationship/house/baby/friend/responsibility/accomplishment/etc., so I like to be told that God has good plans for me. I like to imagine him saying, “I know the plans I have for you…”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://nourish.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/trail-mix-nancy-mueller.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Okay, not to be harsh, but <strong>the Bible isn’t supposed to be about us.</strong> It’s actually not about us at all and it’s high time we quit acting like it’s a self-help book or a book full of timeless, ready-to-be-applied principles. It takes study—actual study—and hard work to read and understand the Bible and what God is saying to us. And if any book in the world is worthy of our time and energy and study, it’s got to be the Bible. But we so often pretend like it’s not.</p>
<p>Now, let me stop real quick and make sure you’re not hearing me say something I’m not. I’m not saying that the Bible isn’t applicable to you and your life. It is. <strong>But most of the Bible is not written to be timelessly applied to anyone, anywhere.</strong> The book of Romans was written to people who lived in Rome during the 1st century, not to people in America in 2013. Genesis was written for the Jewish people wandering in the desert and then entering the Holy Land during the time of Moses and Joshua, not for the people of your church. And Jeremiah, where this particular verse comes from? Well, we’ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>Now there are two doctrines that I want to highlight before I go any farther to make sure I express fully how Scripture should be applied to our lives. One is the doctrine of <strong>inspiration</strong> and the other is the doctrine of <strong>perspicuity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>First, the doctrine of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inspiration</span> means that <strong>the Bible is a divine product</strong>: it is inspired by God. God worked through the process of the composition and preservation of the books of the Bible. Therefore, yes, they were kind of written <em>for</em> us, but that’s different than them being written <em>to</em> us. God knew we would be reading Genesis someday, but Moses didn’t. And so the words that Moses wrote, although inspired by God, are not written to believers in the 21st century. When Paul wrote Romans, it never crossed his mind that Amy Chase from Ohio would be reading and studying them in 2013. So even though God inspired Paul to write and to write things that would remain applicable to people in 2013, Paul wasn’t intending to do that.</p>
<h2 id="perspicuity">Perspicuity</h2>
<p>The next doctrine is that of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perspicuity</span> of Scripture. Perspicuity is just a fancy word for “<strong>clear</strong>.” (Biblical scholars love fancy words for things.) Basically, the biblical text can be clearly understood by the ordinary reader. Someone can pick up the Bible and read it and understand it. It’s not gibberish. Anyone who can read can read the gospel accounts and understand that the story is about Jesus the Messiah, coming to earth, dying on a cross, and rising from the dead.</p>
<p>So, yes, you can pick up the Bible and “just read it.” And you do have, as a believer, the Holy Spirit helping you and guiding you. <strong>But the Holy Spirit is not, I believe, a big fan of laziness.</strong> He’s ready to help and guide you, but there are some things, like the geographic position of Jerusalem or the historical situation that caused Paul to write to the Romans, that he’s not going to be able to inspire in you. Well, he could, but that would be strange. Imagine if you just woke up tomorrow and could draw a detailed map of Israel, having never studied it. It’d be kind of like cheating, especially since that’s an assignment I had to do a lot of studying to be able to do. It’s a little like a parent helping a child with homework. If my mom had done my math homework for me, it wouldn’t have done me any good. But she did help me connect the dots and understand what I was supposed to be doing to get the right answer. <strong>The Holy Spirit will help you understand the Bible, but he’s not going to just read it for you and then inspire in your some kind of otherworldly, enlightened understanding.</strong> You will have to exert some effort. The knowledge is there for you, but you have to learn it.</p>
<p>At Cedarville, I majored in Bible and one of the very first things we were taught to do was to interpret Scripture well and then to be aware of when someone wasn’t. And, at Cedarville, when a chapel speaker or someone else mentions Jeremiah 29:11, all the Bible majors groan. It’s because Jeremiah 29:11 was the go-to verse that professors used to show us how the Bible is mishandled. Like I joked above, we decide that the “<em>you</em>” in “<em>I know the plans I have for you</em>” is the person starting the new job or the person who has lost their lucky pencil. Does God have good plans for your life? Yes, absolutely. But this isn’t the verse to prove it. And it certainly isn’t the verse to put on a graduation card. Let me explain why.</p>

<h2 id="inductive-bible-study-7-steps-to-study-the-bible">Inductive Bible Study: 7 Steps to Study the Bible</h2>
<p>But first, let me say a couple things about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">process</span> I’ll be using. At Cedarville, everyone takes certain classes and in one such class we were taught Bible study method, in particular, the <strong><em>inductive Bible study</em>.</strong> It’s a process by which anyone—and I mean anyone—can come to an educated understanding of what a passage is saying. I can do it, my grandma can do it, pastors can do it, and my 5th grade cousin can do it.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-survey-reading-and-historical-background">Step One: Survey Reading and Historical Background.</h3>
<p>Want to know what Jeremiah 29:11 means? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Read Jeremiah.</em></span> Okay, that’s a really long book. Sorry. Take that up with Jeremiah or God, I guess. Want to understand 1 Corinthians 13, the love chapter? Read 1 Corinthians. Want to understand John 3:16? Read John. Now, I’m not saying to study the whole thing to every minute detail, just read it. You can read it quickly even. Hey, college students know: a lot of assignments that are assigned to be “read” can be “skimmed.” I’m not suggesting we slack when reading the Bible, but you as long as you’re getting an idea of the book and what is being said, then you’re doing fine. Take a couple notes while you read: Who wrote the book? To whom? When? Why? What is the tone? What seems to be the big idea? What is each chapter about?</p>
<h3 id="step-two-unaided-observations">Step Two: Unaided Observations.</h3>
<p>Read the passage you want to study and understand. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Take notes.</span> When I did inductive studies for class, I had to do upwards of 10 observations per verse. To start, just aim for 3 or 4 per verse. They can be as simple as “Paul is making a statement here,” or “Jesus gives a command,” or “This verse switches from third person to first person.” They are called unaided because it’s just things you can come up with on your own. Things like repeated words and cause and effect statements are important to point out in your observations.</p>
<h3 id="step-three-interpretive-questions">Step Three: Interpretive Questions.</h3>
<p>After you make your observations, you’ll probably have some questions like, “Why did Paul say it that way?” or “What does this word mean?” If they’re questions you can’t answer on your own about your passage, that’s an interpretive question. Moving forward, it will be your goal to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">find an answer to your interpretive questions.</span> Try to come up with about five, but you can have as many as you want.</p>
<h3 id="step-four-word-studies">Step Four: Word Studies.</h3>
<p>All right, this is where it might seem to get complicated, but remember: I said that everyone could do this method. When we read the Bible, what we read is a translation. Although these translations are wonderful gifts for which we should be immensely grateful, they are also, unfortunately, a bit removed from the original. This means that some of the depth or nuance of the original might be lost without additional study.</p>
<p>Your Bible isn’t wrong, it’s just that the word in the original language might have more meaning than it’s possible for one English word to communicate. The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and the New Testament was originally written in Greek. So with word studies, we take an English word that is crucial in the verse and figure out what Hebrew or Greek word is was translated from.</p>
<h3 id="step-five-commentaries">Step Five: Commentaries.</h3>
<p>Say we’re working with John 3:16. What words might be counted as crucial? “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son…” There are lots of possibilities. It’s up to you to decide. Once you do that, there is a plethora of resources to help you see what the original word was and what meanings went along with it, and those resources are as close as your computer. The original word may encompass more or less than the English word. For example, using online resources, we see that the Greek word for “world” in John 3:16 is κοσμος with the meanings “the world, the universe, worldly affairs, the inhabitants of the world.” Sure, it might not be earth-shattering, but it’s an insight into the original language. And sometimes your findings may very well change how you read and understand a verse.</p>
<p>It’s just reading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what the experts have to say</span>. Commentaries will be the place where you’ll find answers to most of your interpretive questions. There are some very affordable commentaries out there and if you’re really looking to dig into a book of the Bible, buying one of two of them would be a great choice. Otherwise, there are a few online, but not the best ones. Libraries, Christian bookstores, and your church library would be good places to look. Not all commentaries are big, scary, technical books, and there are some that are very helpful and easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="step-six-synthesize">Step Six: Synthesize.</h3>
<p>Look at everything you’ve done and figure out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what it all means together.</span> We were taught to come up with a “Big Idea” which basically says what the passage is about and what it says about what it is about. And, we stay away from any <em>here</em> and <em>now</em> language (talking about what it means for me and you) and use only <em>then</em> and <em>there</em> language (what it meant back then). So what is John 3:16 about? God sending his Son. What does it say about God sending his Son? That he did it because he loved the world and that believing in the Son is the way to everlasting life.</p>
<h3 id="step-seven-application">Step Seven: Application.</h3>
<p>All right, until this point, we’ve avoided talking about ourselves. We’ve focused on what the author was saying to his intended audience. And, because of that, we should be able to figure out what the passage meant to the people it was written to originally. Now, to apply it, we need to figure out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what we have in common with that original audience.</span> If we are very similar, then we can apply it pretty directly, but if we are not, then the application will take a little more work and probably be a little more abstract.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="now-lets-go-back-to-my-beef-with-jeremiah-2911">Now, let’s go back to my beef with Jeremiah 29:11.</h2>
<p>Having done an inductive Bible study like I outlined for you, I’d like to explain why this is the verse my professors use to talk about misuse of the Bible. However, you don’t really have to go very far into the process. Let’s read <strong>Jeremiah 29:1-14:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The prophet Jeremiah sent a letter to the exiles Nebuchadnezzar had carried off from Jerusalem to Babylon. It was addressed to the elders who were left among the exiles, to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the other people who were exiled in Babylon. He sent it after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the palace officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had been exiled from Jerusalem. He sent it with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah. King Zedekiah of Judah had sent these men to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. The letter said:</p>
<p>‘The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says to all those he sent into exile to Babylon from Jerusalem, “Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what they produce. Marry and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons and allow your daughters get married so that they too can have sons and daughters. Grow in number; do not dwindle away. Work to see that the city where I sent you as exiles enjoys peace and prosperity. Pray to the Lord for it. For as it prospers you will prosper.”</p>
<p>‘For the Lord God of Israel who rules over all says, “Do not let the prophets or those among you who claim to be able to predict the future by divination deceive you. And do not pay any attention to the dreams that you are encouraging them to dream. They are prophesying lies to you and claiming my authority to do so. But I did not send them. I, the Lord, affirm it!”</p>
<p>‘For the Lord says, “Only when the seventy years of Babylonian rule are over will I again take up consideration for you. Then I will fulfill my gracious promise to you and restore you to your homeland. For I know what I have planned for you,” says the Lord. “I have plans to prosper you, not to harm you. I have plans to give you a future filled with hope. When you call out to me and come to me in prayer, I will hear your prayers. When you seek me in prayer and worship, you will find me available to you. If you seek me with all your heart and soul, I will make myself available to you,” says the Lord. “Then I will reverse your plight and will regather you from all the nations and all the places where I have exiled you,” says the Lord. “I will bring you back to the place from which I exiled you.”’”</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<p><strong>These people weren’t graduating from high school or starting a new job.</strong> Their country had been violently conquered by an outside force, the Temple destroyed, and they were carried off to a foreign country. They were questioning the faithfulness of God, feeling forsaken. Forsaken by God who had promised them the land they had been taken from, the land they had watched being destroyed. And now Jeremiah writes them a letter telling them that God wants them to know that <strong>they’ll be there a while</strong>.</p>
<p>But, because he loves them, God gives them a glimmer of <strong>hope</strong>: this is just a pause in the plans. He still plans to do good to them. But this is a punishment for their disobedience and they will pay the full cost. It’s hope in the midst of one of—if not the—darkest times in Israel’s history. So when we put Jeremiah 29:11 on a wedding card… Well, something just seems a little off to me.</p>
<p>Now, if you are a position where you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suffering</span>, where you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">questioning</span> the faithfulness of God, where you are in a situation comparable to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the exile of the Jewish people</span>, then this verse can be applied more directly to your life (though we still have to deal with the fact that you are not a member of the Jewish nation).</p>
<p><strong>But we really need to stop using it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lightly</span>.</strong> Because when Jeremiah wrote these words to the Jewish people in Babylon, he was not writing them lightly but probably with tears in his eyes. God did not speak them lightly but rather as the eternal Yahweh who will keep his word even in light of the faithlessness of his people.</p>
<p><strong>And if we are going to be the light of the world, then we need to make sure we are treating the Bible the way it deserves to be treated so that we can truly tell the world what God wants them to hear, and not just read them some verse that we don’t fully understand ourselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s be wary of treating the Bible like trail mix because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the world doesn’t need trail mix</span>, it needs to see the God of the Bible in all his power and love and hope.</strong></p>

</p>
<p>A great green theologian of old claimed that anger is based on fear, that it leads to hatred, and results in suffering. And while I do not wish to disregard the wisdom of a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I would like to take a closer look at anger as discussed in Scripture, and to consider what makes certain instances of anger righteous or unrighteous, legitimate or illegitimate.</p>
<p>This is a question that has been on my mind throughout my final year at Cedarville University. After hearing of a few rumblings at the end of my Junior year, I left for the summer and got myself married. When my feet finally touched the ground at the beginning of term, my university felt like a battlefield. I heard that Michael Pahl had been “reviewed” and then fired over the summer months. Others were being reviewed to see if they really did toe the doctrinal line, or if they were guilty of mind crimes against the thought police. And things didn’t get any better from there.</p>
<p>I saw the havoc that the Cedarville environment was wreaking on my mentors, friends, and their families. My leaders got rid of and harassed beloved members of my community, and then deceptively refused to own up to their nefarious actions.</p>
<p><a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2786885016/098d40ad39a165603e09a1915c37f88a.jpeg" alt=""  />
</a><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/">I got angry. I spoke up</a>. And I was convinced that my anger was righteous. Others were less convinced.</p>
<p>Some stayed poignantly and painfully silent throughout the chaos. Others repeatedly gave platitudes that everything was OK, that we were obligated to trust our leaders, that to question their actions was inherently disrespectful. And some from this latter group met my kind of anger with their own frustration and anger that I dared to criticize their beloved Cedarville.</p>
<p>I’d love to say that I met this opposition with nothing but grace and equanimity, but that wouldn’t be true. I frequently lashed out against these types of people – when they sent me long messages to accuse me of causing unnecessary dissentious strife, or when they parodied us student activists as complete morons with nothing better to do than cook up conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>My university’s behavior was sickening, but these people’s behavior was infuriating. I couldn’t comprehend how they could overlook the suffering I was witnessing and try to protect people who were clearly hiding the truth. So, at times, I lashed out in frustration. And I am convinced that my anger was unrighteous. But what’s the difference between these two types of anger?</p>
<p>Before considering how we should be rightly angry, I’d like to ask three questions. The first is for our great green theologian:</p>
<h1 id="yoda-does-righteous-anger-exist">YODA, DOES RIGHTEOUS ANGER EXIST?</h1>
<p>According to Yoda and friends, there is no such thing as legitimate anger, at least not humanly-speaking. After all, doesn’t Proverbs (29:11, NET) say that:</p>
<p>“A fool lets fly with all his temper,</p>
<p>but a wise person keeps it back.”?</p>
<p>And James (1:19-20) says:</p>
<p>“Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness.”</p>
<p>Or what about when Paul says (Eph 4:31-32):</p>
<p>“You must put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling, and slanderous talk—indeed all malice. Instead, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ also forgave you.”</p>
<p>When these verses are combined with our all-too-familiar ways of speaking about “gentle Jesus, meek and mild,” anger ends up getting quite the bad rap! Aren’t Christians supposed to “turn the other cheek” (Matt 5:39)? Aren’t we supposed to keep calm and stay in line – head down, Bible open, mouth shut?</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, Scripture provides a much more complex view of anger than this.</p>
<p>For example, consider Ephesians 4:26-27. Four verses before the command to “put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling … [and] all malice,” Paul tells the Ephesian believers to “Be angry and do not sin.” However, he then continues with the admonition to “not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger” and to “not give the devil an opportunity.”</p>
<p>Although Paul’s seemingly contradictory counsel here is usually used to denounce anger as an appropriate emotion, a closer analysis of these two verses in context appears to give righteous anger a legitimate place when sin infects the Christian community. That is, giving the devil a foothold could refer to either the sin which anger might produce, or to allowing the sin which caused the anger in the first place to fester, but it is not an indictment of the anger itself.</p>
<p>And this is probably for the best, because examples abound of Yahweh, his Son, and his servants getting quite angry!</p>
<p>Consider Exodus 22:22-24:</p>
<p>“You must not afflict any widow or orphan. If you afflict them in any way and they cry to me, I will surely hear their cry, and my anger will burn and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives will be widows and your children will be fatherless.</p>
<p>In the original Hebrew, this passage is even more intense, along the following lines: “If you afflict them <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in even the slightest way</span>, and they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">even think about crying out</span> to me, then I will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hearingly hear</span> their cry. My <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fiery anger will burn</span>, and I will kill you with the sword, so that, in exchange, YOUR wives will be widows and YOUR children will be orphans.” So much for gentle Yahweh, meek and mild!</p>
<p>In the New Testament, we see that the Son of God gets angry as well. After all, when he witnesses money-changers making his Father’s holy house into a marketplace, he doesn’t calmly suggest that they leave. Instead, he makes a whip, flips their tables, scatters their coins, and drives them out of the temple! (Jn 2:13-22).</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider Jesus’ anger at the hypocritical practices of both the scribes and the Pharisees (Matt 23). He calls them children of hell (23:15), blind fools (23:17), whitewashed tombs (23:27), the offspring of vipers (23:33), and descendants of those who murdered the prophets (23:31)!</p>
<p>And speaking of the prophets, as some of Yahweh’s most faithful servants in the midst of faithless generations, they got quite angry themselves! Examples abound, but one of my personal favorites is Amos 7:16-17, the prophet Amos’s response to being told by Amaziah not to preach against Jeroboam and Israel:</p>
<p>So now listen to the Lord’s message! You say, ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel! Don’t preach against the family of Isaac!’</p>
<p>“Therefore this is what the Lord says:</p>
<p>‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets</p>
<p>and your sons and daughters will die violently.</p>
<p>Your land will be given to others</p>
<p>and you will die in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.’”</p>
<p>Based on the behavior of Yahweh, Jesus, and the prophets, it seems that we should reconsider Yoda’s position and at least acknowledge that righteous anger exists. In at least some circumstances, it is possible to be angry and please God.</p>
<p>Our second question, then, is for the most successful Hebrew prophet, who got angry for all the wrong reasons:</p>
<h1 id="jonah-are-you-really-so-very-angry">JONAH, ARE YOU REALLY SO VERY ANGRY?</h1>
<h1 id="httpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediaenthumb117jonah-_a_veggietales_moviejpg220px-jonah-_a_veggietales_moviejpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Jonah-_A_VeggieTales_Movie.jpg/220px-Jonah-_A_VeggieTales_Movie.jpg" alt=""  />
</h1>
<p>I’m presupposing that you all know the basic story of Jonah. You know, the bit about how he refuses to go to the Assyrian capital (Nineveh), gets himself cast into the sea and swallowed by a huge fish, and eventually goes to preach a one sentence prophetic message that turns out to be remarkably successful – everyone from the Ninevite king to the Ninevite cattle repented in sackcloth!</p>
<p>However, the book of Jonah is a much richer literary work than we often give it credit. As just one example out of many ingenious literary moves in the book, us readers never find out Jonah’s motivation for his disobedience, reluctance, and frustration until the fourth and final chapter. As was read earlier, Nineveh’s repentance and Yahweh’s relent from judgment…(Jonah 4:1-4)</p>
<p>displeased Jonah terribly and he became very angry. He prayed to the Lord and said, “Oh, Lord, this is just what I thought would happen when I was in my own country. This is what I tried to prevent by attempting to escape to Tarshish!—</p>
<p>What Jonah has to say next, however, is even more shocking!</p>
<p>because I knew that you are gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in mercy, and one who relents concerning threatened judgment. So now, Lord, kill me instead, because I would rather die than live!”</p>
<p>Jonah’s not angry because of injustice or even inconvenience…he’s angry because of God’s mercy or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>hesed</em></span>: his gracious, compassionate, relenting, merciful, and steadfast love! But before we consider the heinous nature of such anger, let’s note that this is a theologically astute observation on Jonah’s part. He’s quoting a creed which gets at the heart of who Yahweh is:</p>
<p>Consider Exodus 34:6</p>
<p>The Lord passed by before him and proclaimed: “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in loyal love (hesed) and faithfulness,</p>
<p>Nehemiah 9:17</p>
<p>But you are a God of forgiveness, merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and unfailing in your loyal love (hesed).</p>
<p>Psalm 86:15</p>
<p>But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God.</p>
<p>You are patient and demonstrate great loyal love (hesed) and faithfulness.</p>
<p>Joel 2:13</p>
<p>Return to the Lord your God,</p>
<p>for he is merciful and compassionate,</p>
<p>slow to anger and boundless in loyal love—often relenting from calamitous punishment.</p>
<p>Yahweh is slow to anger (literally “long of nostrils,” picture the deep sigh you give when someone frustrates you) and abounding in <em>hesed</em>, which predisposes him toward mercy, compassion, and even relenting from judgment, as he had just done with the Ninevites. And THIS is what makes Jonah so upset.</p>
<p>Instead of being joyful at the broad scope of the Gospel as God’s redemptive mission, at the remarkable success of his brief prophetic endeavor, and at the complete repentance of the Ninevite people, Jonah is furious because God has broken his mold. Yahweh had chosen to relent and to redeem the Ninevite other, and for Jonah, this was simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>Yahweh’s first rhetorical question, “Are you really so very angry?” (4:4) fails to bring Jonah around. And things get even worse. Jonah goes to sit and see what would happen to Nineveh. God sends a <em>qiqayon</em>, a little plant, to provide shade for the ornery prophet, and Jonah was very delighted. However, Yahweh the masterful teacher then sends a worm to devour the plant and a hot east wind to make Jonah faint. True to form, Jonah again cries out in anger: “I would rather die than live!” (4:8).</p>
<p>Yahweh challenges Jonah again: “Are you really (or rightly) so very angry about the little plant?” Jonah replies: “I have good reason to be angry, even to death (NASB or) I am as angry as I could possibly be!” (4:9).</p>
<p>Then Yahweh brings the lesson home with force: “You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight. 11 Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city (implied: for which I worked and which I caused to grow!) in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals? (4:10-11, NASB)”</p>
<p>Jonah’s anger was unrighteous in that it was a self-centered hindrance to God’s mission. By scorning Yahweh’s mercy and ignoring the broad scope of his redemptive <em>hesed</em> love, Jonah disdained the repentance of the Ninevite other. He got angry for all the wrong reasons. And yet his failures are a powerful indictment against our own. After all, at least 90% of my anger is driven by selfish concerns. It’s not even an “us vs. them” moment most of the time. It’s usually ME vs. everyone else! and I can’t often care any LESS about God’s redemptive mission, as long as the checkout line’s moving too slowly for my liking, as long as the car in front of me just cut me off, as long as there’s someone on the internet with whom I disagree!</p>
<p>If it’s so easy to fall into Jonah-like frustration, is there any hope left for righteous anger?</p>
<p>Let’s ask the prophet who got to preach Jonah’s dream message against Nineveh:</p>
<h1 id="nahum-why-is-god-so-angryfilenahum-prophetjpghttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons774nahum-prophetjpg">NAHUM, WHY IS GOD SO ANGRY?<img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Nahum-prophet.jpg" alt="File:Nahum-prophet.jpg"  />
</h1>
<p>In the seventh century BC, Nahum got to preach the prophetic oracles against Nineveh that Jonah had wanted to utter. Apparently, although Nineveh and the Assyrians had been used by God as an instrument of judgment in the eighth century exile, they had grown prideful of their vicious pursuits. Drunk with the blood of their victims, the Assyrians paid no mind to Yahweh who had allowed them to thrive. This brought about a change in the divine approach to the Assyrian empire. We can see this in Nahum’s modification of the traditional credal statement mentioned above. Let’s take another look at Nahum 1:2-3:</p>
<p>The Lord is a zealous and avenging God;</p>
<p>the Lord is avenging and very angry.</p>
<p>The Lord takes vengeance against his foes;</p>
<p>he sustains his rage against his enemies.</p>
<p>3 The Lord is slow to anger but great in power;</p>
<p>the Lord will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.</p>
<p>If you’ll compare Nahum 1:3 with Jonah 4:2, you’ll see what I mean. Although the traditional form is “Yahweh is slow to anger, but great in <em>hesed</em>,” Nahum switches <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>hesed</em></span> out with <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>power</em></span>. No longer would the vicious Assyrians experience the merciful and steadfast love of Yahweh. As <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Nahum+1:3">one commentator puts it</a>, “God’s patience at the time of Jonah one century earlier had run out. Nineveh had exhausted the “great mercy” of God and now would experience the “great power” of God.” The rest of the book of Nahum is a series of oracles describing exactly what this would mean.</p>
<p>I believe that Nahum’s devastating oracles against Nineveh were important to the Hebrew mindset because they preserved Yahweh’s powerful justice as the counterpoint to the themes of merciful universalism in books like Jonah. Nahum’s relationship to Jonah is a bit like the relationship of Job and Ecclesiastes to Proverbs. The former provide important theological counterpoints to the latter books. In Jonah, Yahweh desires to teach the arrogant Hebrew prophet a lesson about the scope of the divine mission of mercy and redemption. Although it’s understandable why Jonah would have been hesitant to see Nineveh repent and be delivered from judgment (given Assyria’s messy relationship with Israel), Yahweh wanted to show Jonah that NO ONE was outside of his mercy’s reach. In fact, sometimes Ninevites repent better than God’s chosen people!</p>
<p>But what about when the Ninevites are consistently guilty of atrocities against God’s people? Sure, that doesn’t mean Israel should go all Jonah on them and discount the possibility of repentance/deliverance ever occurring, but what about on God’s end of the deal? Is he so merciful that he no longer cares about injustice? Is he getting soft? Turning into some passive nice guy who’s only mildly bothered by things like slaughter and oppression?</p>
<p>Books like Nahum answer those kind of painful questions cried out by victims of oppression:</p>
<p>No. Yahweh is not complacent when it comes to heinous sin. In fact, he hates it more than any human possibly could. This does not negate his mercy – the message of Jonah still stands – but he is not a passive onlooker when it comes to Sin and Death and those who enact them. He is a mighty warrior on a mission of redemption and deliverance, especially when it comes to the powerless and the oppressed. This theme echoes throughout the pages of Scripture, from the Exodus to the Cross to the coming Kingdom. The righteous anger of Yahweh is redemptive, and it usually focuses on the mistreatment of the weak.</p>
<h1 id="how-then-should-we-be-angry">HOW, THEN, SHOULD WE BE ANGRY?</h1>
<p>If Yoda, Jonah, and Nahum have taught us anything, we should acknowledge that the crucial difference between righteous and unrighteous anger is whether it helps or hinders God’s redemptive mission, the Gospel. It’s important, then, that we sit long with Scripture and the Church in order to better know what the Gospel really is. The more clearly we understand the foundational Gospel principles of things like <em>shalom</em> peace, <em>hesed</em> love, and <em>mishpat</em> justice, the more likely it is that we’ll recognize the appropriate things to get angry about. As we become more familiar with God’s redemptive mission, we should gently remind Yoda and others that there is indeed a place for anger which is pleasing to God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should heed the warnings of Jonah’s failures, lest our anger be just as self-centered and Gospel-opposed as his was. After all, we can ALWAYS stumble down Jonah’s path. When it comes to my anger against my alma mater and my online detractors, as much as I’d like to paint the unjust fundamentalists as the Jonahs of the story… I’m just as much like Jonah when I refuse to believe that God can work through them, when I place them outside of the scope of God’s redemptive mission. We do well to consider continually whether our anger is stubbornly self-centered, and to remind ourselves that Yahweh is (insert deep, calming sigh) slow to anger and abounding in hesed. The people of God should strive to exemplify the same attributes.</p>
<p>However, Nahum reminds us that God will not be mocked. He takes oppressive opposition to his redemptive mission very seriously, and the divine warrior’s wrath is kindled when Sin and Death rear their ugly heads in this world. He rages against the violence, poverty, famine, hunger, disease, disasters, and indifference which kill untold millions of his precious image-bearers each year. His fiery anger burns when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-selective_abortion">baby girls are killed for nothing more than their gender</a>, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Savar_building_collapse">people die amid the rubble of poorly-built factories for the sake of corporate greed</a> – the idols of wealth and power, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS">children have to witness their parents die from HIV/AIDS</a>, not knowing how long they and their siblings have before the disease takes their lives as well. If these things do not anger us, something is wrong.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most infuriating thing to Yahweh is when those who have been redeemed in and through his precious Son commit injustices in his holy name! I can only imagine how angry it makes God that his people treat others as inferior beings – be it <a href="http://dannimoss.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/paige-patterson-on-domestic-violence/">women</a>, or <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2006/winter/christian-nativism#.UZgp2LWG3ng">immigrants</a>, or <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">homosexuals</a>, or <a href="http://www.biblerays.com/race-mixing.html">other races</a>, or the poor – for the sake of a pretentious and profane pride they DARE to call holiness.</p>
<p>Or what about the divine heartbreak over the fragmentation of the Church? Can you imagine how much it upsets God when his people split for every little reason, in pursuit of supposed “purity,” ignoring that the goal of his redemptive mission is to reconcile all things to himself, to make us ONE in Christ?</p>
<p>To bring this closer to home, can you imagine how much it upsets God that <a href="http://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">my university</a>, which claims to exist “For the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ,” has repeatedly shown itself willing to mistreat godly people and then to lie about it? That the leaders of Cedarville are willing to buy the silence of the mistreated through non-disclosure agreements? That they are willing to appeal to God’s knowledge by using platitudes like “God is not surprised” to justify their actions against those who have less power? What happened to Michael Pahl and his family, <a href="http://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">in addition to many others this year within the Cedarville community</a> at the hands of those who claim Christ’s name has been appallingly shameful.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, we serve a God who is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast, merciful, and compassionate love. Let us not forget these things. May we, as God’s people, always be driven by the logic of his redemptive love.</p>
<p>But Yahweh is also immensely powerful and passionate, and often very angry about the effects of Sin and Death around the world and among his people. Therefore, let us not sin in our anger, as we are prone to do, but let us oppose sin in our righteous anger, with our eyes and our hearts turned toward the powerless, oppressed, sick, broken, and dying of this world as we further Yahweh’s redemptive mission and accomplish the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>As the climactic renewal and enumeration of Yahweh’s covenant with Israel, Deuteronomy contains at its core a cross between an ancient Near Eastern law code and treaty.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Within this structure, the laws and treaty stipulations – general (5:1-11:32) and specific (12:1-26:19) – are given pride of place. After the setting and introduction to the covenant (4:44-49), Moses<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> begins his second sermon (5:1-28:69) with an interpretive restatement of the Decalogue (5:6-21), couched within an extended reflection on the initial law-giving at Horeb and Moses’ role as mediator (5:1-33).</p>
<p>In the passage at hand (6:1-15), he then transitions to the remainder of the general stipulations (6:1-11:32) with an introductory exhortation (6:1-3), a distillation of the covenant principles (6:4-5), and an extension of these principles to future generations and society (6:6-9), concluding with a warning against forgetfulness and idolatry as the Israelites soon enter the land of Canaan (6:10-15). <em><strong>In remembrance of and in response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, Israel must love Yahweh absolutely and exclusively by internalizing, embodying, and teaching covenant faithfulness as they inherit the blessings of the promised land.</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="introductory-exhortation-61-3">INTRODUCTORY EXHORTATION: 6:1-3</h1>
<p>Moses begins this passage with an exhortation to keep the general stipulations of the covenant to be discussed in Deuteronomy 6-11. In response to Yahweh’s command (recounted at 5:31), Moses teaches the people the “commandments, statutes, and ordinances” (5:31, 6:1; referring to the covenant stipulations)<sup> <a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></sup> so that they will “carry them out in the land” (5:31, 6:1).</p>
<p>This transmission of the covenant stipulations from Yahweh to Moses to the Israelites was not meant to achieve a merely epistemic result, but also an ontic one. That is, Moses was not merely teaching them the stipulations so that they would merely know (and do) the right things, but so that they would be the right kind of people, internalizing and embodying the stipulations as they entered the promised land of Canaan. The intended result of the commandments, statutes, and ordinances was holistic covenant faithfulness.</p>
<p>At the heart of the appropriate epistemic and ontic response to the covenant stipulations was the proper fear of Yahweh their God (6:2a), which was to result in a continual obedience for generations upon generations (6:2b),<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> reflecting the importance of teaching covenant faithfulness to their children.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> As the injunctions to “pay attention” and “be careful” (6:3a) indicate, this obedience was also to be careful and deliberate.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> The promised results of such continual and careful covenant faithfulness are long life (6:2c) and many descendants (6:2b, 3a) in the bountiful promised land (6:1b, 3b), recalling Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to fulfill his promises of land and offspring to Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<h1 id="distillation-of-the-covenant-principles-64-5">DISTILLATION OF THE COVENANT PRINCIPLES: 6:4-5</h1>
<p>Following the brief introduction to the general stipulations (6:1-3), Moses distills the Decalogue, itself an encapsulation of the entire covenant, into just sixteen Hebrew words, providing “the expression of the essence of all God’s person and purposes” (6:4-5).<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Named after the first Hebrew word in 6:4 (<em>shéma’</em>, “hear, pay attention”), the “Great Shema” has long been regarded as central to Deuteronomy and to Israelite theology and praxis.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> However, because of its brevity, the translation of the Shema (particularly 6:4) into English has been the topic of considerable debate. Although the initial imperative and vocative (“pay attention, Israel”) are clear enough, translating the remaining four terms (“Yahweh, our God, Yahweh, one”) into English involves making a decision on the placement of the copulative and the precise translation of <em>ekhad</em> as “one” or “alone.”<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>On balance, given the statement’s quasi-poetic brevity, it seems best to render 6:4: “Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is one.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> This translation allows for a mediating position between Block’s arguments for rendering <em>ekhad</em> as “alone,” emphasizing God’s uniqueness, and Janzen’s arguments for God’s oneness as internal consistency and faithfulness to Israel.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Compared to the gamut of Canaanite and other ancient Near Eastern deities, Yahweh was indeed unique,<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> primarily because of his faithfulness to Israel from the patriarchs (6:3b, 10a), through the exodus (6:12), and into the imminent conquest of Canaan (6:1b, 3, 10-11). That “Yahweh is one” is not so much an ontological statement as it is a historical reflection<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> in remembrance of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to his covenant people.</p>
<p>Therefore, in response to this unique faithfulness, Israel must love Yahweh absolutely (6:5), as seen by the concentric use of <em>lebab</em> (“heart,” the inner being, including emotion and intellect), <em>nephesh</em> (“soul,” the entire being, including desires), and <em>me’od</em> (“strength,” the physical being, including economic and social resources).<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> This is the only proper response to the God who is truly <em>ekhad</em> (6:4),<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> comprising the essential principle upon which the entire covenant rested.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> Related to the previously mentioned fear of Yahweh and obedience to the covenant stipulations (6:1-3), loving Yahweh involves the epistemic/ontic response of internalizing (with the <em>lebab</em> and <em>nephesh</em>) and embodying (through the <em>me’od</em>) covenant faithfulness.</p>
<h1 id="extension-to-family-and-society--66-9">EXTENSION TO FAMILY AND SOCIETY – 6:6-9</h1>
<p>The proper love of Yahweh is absolute, permeating not only the entire person (6:5), but also all of life (6:6-9),<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> including the family unit (6:7) and society (6:8-9). Beginning again with the concept of epistemic internalization, Moses commands the Israelites to keep “these words” (referring to the entire covenant through the Shema)<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> on their hearts/minds (6:6).</p>
<p>This internalization of the covenant through constant reflection is then to be extended by teaching covenant faithfulness to future generations (6:7a), here described with an unusual verb (<em>shanan</em>) which evokes the imagery of engraving a message into stone.<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a> Just as Moses is teaching the Israelites the covenant stipulations, they must teach these things to their children through constant repetition and discussion of the faithful covenant lifestyle within the household, reflected through the double merism of 6:7b (sitting/walking; lying down/getting up).<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Finally, this commitment to covenant faithfulness was to transcend the household and permeate the entire society (6:8-9). Although the instructions here (to “tie,” “fasten,” and “inscribe” the covenant stipulations on the forearm, forehead, and door frames, respectively) were taken literally in later Jewish tradition,<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> they were probably meant to be interpreted metaphorically.<a href="#_ftn23">[23]</a> In this case, 6:8 refers to the embodiment of the covenant principles in everyday life, identifying each individual Israelite as a faithful covenant member.<a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a></p>
<p>However, in 6:9 the exhortation to covenant faithfulness is then expanded to the household and the community as “these words” (6:6) are inscribed “on the doorframes of your houses and gates” (6:9).<a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> In response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, the Israelites are to love him absolutely by internalizing (6:6), embodying (6:8-9), and teaching (6:7) covenant faithfulness.</p>
<p>(For more even more biblical exposition, see <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/12/13/the-epistle-to-philemon/">my essay on Philemon</a>.)</p>
<h1 id="warning-against-forgetful-idolatry-610-15">WARNING AGAINST FORGETFUL IDOLATRY: 6:10-15</h1>
<p>However, the proper love of Yahweh is also exclusive, for his uniqueness demands that he be worshipped alone. After distilling the covenant (6:4-5) and extending its essential claim to the family and society (6:6-9), Moses exhorts his audience to eschew all forms of forgetful idolatry. Instead, the Israelites are to love Yahweh exclusively as they inherit the blessings of the promised land, in remembrance of and in response to his unique faithfulness (6:10-15).</p>
<p>The historical context of this passage is especially important for the interpretation of 6:10-11. Moses reminds the Israelites of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness by linking the divine promises of land to the patriarchs with the fulfillment of those promises in the imminent conquest and occupation of Canaan.<a href="#_ftn26">[26]</a> The concrete description of the promised land in 6:10b-11 was designed to remind the audience that it was a blessing and a gift from Yahweh in faithful fulfillment of his kingly duties.<a href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> The warning in 6:12 to “be careful” reveals Moses’ anxiety that the sudden affluence the Israelites would experience in Canaan might lead them to forget their uniquely faithful God, who had redeemed them from the oppressive hand of the Egyptians and provided for them throughout the wilderness wanderings.<a href="#_ftn28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Therefore, 6:13 contains an intensely covenantal threefold call to the exclusive love of Yahweh alone.<a href="#_ftn29">[29]</a> As part of the proper response to Yahweh’s oneness (6:4), the Israelites are to fear only Yahweh, serve only Yahweh, and swear only by Yahweh’s name.<a href="#_ftn30">[30]</a> Moses then intensifies the warning even further in 6:14-15 with a rephrasing of the first two commandments (Deut 5:7-10).<a href="#_ftn31">[31]</a> On the basis of Yahweh’s righteous jealousy and the promised punishment of exile (5:9; 6:15; cf. 28:63; Lev 26:43), the Israelites are to love Yahweh exclusively by completely eschewing all forms of foreign idolatry (6:14).<a href="#_ftn32">[32]</a></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>As an introduction to the main exposition of the general covenant stipulations (Deut 6-11), Moses begins with an exhortation, calling the Israelites to the proper internalized and embodied response to Yahweh’s commands, statutes, and ordinances: covenant faithfulness as they enter the promised land (6:1-3). Then, he presents the distilled essence of the covenant principles in 6:4-5: the demand for the absolute love of Yahweh on the basis of his unique faithfulness.</p>
<p>This essential covenant claim is then extended to the family unit and society in 6:6-9 as the Israelites are commanded to internalize, embody, and teach covenant faithfulness to future generations.</p>
<p>Finally, in 6:10-15, in anticipation of the conquest of Canaan as a revelation of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to the patriarchs and the nation, the people are sternly warned to eschew all forms of forgetful idolatry and instead to worship Yahweh alone.</p>
<p>Therefore, taken as a whole, Deuteronomy 6:1-15 was written to teach its original audience that, <em>in remembrance of and in response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, they were to love Yahweh absolutely and exclusively by internalizing, embodying, and teaching covenant faithfulness as they inherited the blessings of the promised land.</em></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> The relevant sections are: Historical Prologue – Deut 1-3; Laws/Treaty Stipulations – chs. 4-26; Document Clause – 27:3; 31:9-13; Blessings – 28:1-14; and Curses – 28:15-68. Gordon J. Wenham proposes this structural approach to the Deuteronomic covenant in <em>A Guide to the Pentateuch</em> (vol. 1 of <em>Exploring the Old Testament</em>; Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 2002), 125. The similarities between Deuteronomy and ANE suzerain-vassal treaties are also noted by Eugene E. Carpenter in “Deuteronomy,” in <em>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy</em> (ed. John H. Walton; vol. 1 of <em>Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary: Old Testament</em>, ed. John H. Walton; Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2009), 420.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> Throughout this study, I assume Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy. Furthermore, I assume that the passage at hand was originally composed just prior to Moses’ death and the subsequent conquest of Canaan. With regards to setting, Carpenter places Moses in the plains of Moab on the eastern side of the Jordan River in either 1406 or 1229 B.C. The earliest extra-biblical account of the Israelites in Canaan, a stele erected by Merneptah in western Thebes, mentions them already in the land in 1209 B.C (Cf. Carpenter, 420).</p>

Merrill notes this as the standard reference to the covenant stipulations as opposed to the Decalogue or the law as a whole (<em>Deuteronomy</em> (NAC 4; Nashville: Broadman &amp; Holman, 1994), 160). Cf. Deut 4:1-8 for an example of how this phrase and its permutations are used as a reference and structural marker.</p>

      <title>You&#39;re Reading Romans 13 Wrong! Here&#39;s How to Read It Correctly</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.</p>
<p>Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.</p>
<p>An adequate case study of this phenomenon is the interpretation(s) of Romans 13:1-7, a text that has been used to justify everything from utter obedience to totalitarian regimes to unquestioning support of harsh anti-immigration laws. These seven verses from Paul’s epistle to the Romans have been grossly abused at numerous points since their original composition.</p>
<p>In Romans 13:1-7, Paul exhorts the Roman believers to apply his previous commands toward love (12:9), harmony (12:16), and peace (12:18) in the context of obedience to government (13:1-5) and the payment of taxes (13:6-7).</p>
<p>Far from being a comprehensive condensation of the apostle’s beliefs regarding any and all governments past and present, this passage is a specific and historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, discouraging them from political unrest, disobedience, and rebellion in order to protect their testimony and the effectiveness of the Roman church in the gospel mission.</p>
<p>This thesis will be “proven” by appealing to the historical context of the original audience and the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10 in which this passage rests.</p>
<p>(For more on the book of Romans, check out <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2015/10/03/faithful-faith-in-a-faithful-god-romans-1-1-17/">my sermon on Romans 1:1-17</a>. Looking for a great commentary on Romans? <a href="https://amzn.to/3S1KBB1">Read this one by Doug Moo</a> [affiliate link]!)</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2>
<p>When Romans 13:1-7 is read as if it was written in a modern North American context, it seems as though Paul is appealing to the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations to remind us of the divinely-appointed nature of our free-market economy and federal constitutional republic.</p>
<p>All of this is supposedly done to prompt us toward active participation in our civil government and unquestioning obedience to all of its laws. After all, these verses come up in discussions of Christian political involvement, debates on just war theory vs. pacifism, and diatribes against illegal immigrants and those who desire to aid them.</p>
<p>However, using these seven verses as a packet theology of church and state is problematic, even within the Pauline corpus alone. The same man who wrote Romans 13 also frequently took up themes in his writings that would challenge the power and authority of the Roman Empire, for the declaration that Jesus is Lord contains the implicit declaration that Caesar is not. Our understanding of these seven verses must, therefore, be able to mesh with other passages (such as Phil 2:6-11; 3:20-21; 1 Thess 1:9-10; and 4:13-5:11) and their implications on relations between church and state.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Many commentators in recent years have recognized the importance of interpreting this passage in light of its historical context at the time of its composition (c. A.D. 57<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>), instead of assuming that these verses are Paul’s fundamental views on how church and state should relate to each other.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Knowledge of the situation facing the Roman Christians in A.D. 57 is crucial to the interpretation of this text. Emperor Claudius had expulsed Jews from the city of Rome in A.D. 49, removing Jewish believers from the Roman church and therefore leaving only Gentile Christians behind in their stead.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>However, Claudius was killed by his wife Agrippina in A.D. 54, and her son Nero advanced to the throne that same year, immediately allowing the Jews to return to the city. When Romans was written by Paul in A.D. 57, the Empire enjoyed a period of peace that looked quite different from the chaos that would characterize the later years of Nero’s reign.</p>
<p>Guided by his advisor Seneca, Nero made promises of a different and better peace than the <em>pax romana</em> of Augustus. He promised true peace, characterized by restraint and the peaceful resistance to using force in order to govern. While these promises were dashed beginning in A.D. 59, with Nero’s matricide, the loss of his advisors, and the beginning of his persecution of Christians, it is crucial to remember that Paul wrote Romans during the period of hopeful peace from A.D. 54-59.</p>
<p>Romans 13:1-7 should not, therefore, be interpreted as if it were written to Roman believers in the later years of Nero’s reign, when persecution and oppression were rampant, for this would unduly strengthen Paul’s “pro-Empire” sentiments here.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>With this background information, it is easy to see why Paul here gives advice to his readers, a cosmopolitan church in Rome struggling to figure out Jew-Gentile dynamics in the early years of Nero’s reign, so as to prevent them from drawing negative attention to themselves and damaging the effectiveness of the gospel mission.</p>
<p>Although things were presumably “going well,” as mentioned above, Paul knew full well that things could get tense for the Roman believers very quickly. Despite the period of relative peace from A.D. 54-59, tensions were rising in Rome in A.D. 57-58 regarding the particularly nasty practice of indirect taxation. Furthermore, the Jewish believers who had returned to the city in A.D. 54 might not have been on the best terms with neither the Roman authorities nor the Gentile believers. Much of what Paul has to say in this epistle speaks to this issue: the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians within the Roman context.</p>
<p>It is not, therefore, unreasonable to assume that this played a role in the social tension Paul here addresses in Romans 13:1-7. Furthermore, revolutionary sentiments were in vogue at this time among the Jews in Palestine, and Paul was perhaps worried that the fervor would spread to the Roman church and quickly create some serious problems given the tensions within the church and its social context.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Positively, then, when Romans was written, the original audience enjoyed a period of relative peace and stability before the chaotic upheaval that would take place in A.D. 59.</p>
<p>Negatively, there was still quite a bit of tension within and around the Roman church which had the potential to divide the church and get the Christians in serious trouble with Roman authorities if rebellion became the rallying cry for the followers of Jesus, assured of the lordship of their King and the reality of his kingdom.</p>
<p>It is therefore a mistake to read Romans 13:1-7 as a justification of the sins of the state, as if this passage gave a carte blanche to the atrocities to be committed in the later years of Nero’s reign. Paul was capable of saying negative things about pagan governments when they were going awry<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>, but he nevertheless appealed to God’s sovereignty over human governments in order to prevent the tense situation of his audience from erupting into a social upheaval that would wreck the church’s testimony and hinder the gospel mission in the city of Rome and the empire over which that city ruled.</p>
<p>His audience then (and readers of the epistle today) would not, therefore, be expected to never challenge the government or abstain from promoting or participating in its practices, as Romans 13:1-7 has often been used to argue. Instead, they were (and are) to wisely interact with human governments, not seeking to cause any trouble in society that would damage their testimony, but not hesitating to stand firm in the cause of Christ their King when human governments do things contrary to the kingdom of God.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Wright pulls these themes together quite well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]recisely because of all the counter-imperial hints Paul has given not only in this letter and elsewhere but indeed by his entire gospel, it is vital that he steer Christians away from the assumption that loyalty to Jesus would mean the kind of civil disobedience and revolution that merely reshuffles the political cards into a different order. […] The main thing Paul wants to emphasize is that, <em>even though Christians are servants of the Messiah, the true lord, this does not give them carte blanche to ignore the temporary subordinates whose appointed task, whether (like Cyrus) they know it or not, is to bring at least a measure of God’s order and justice to the world. The church must live as a sign of the kingdom yet to come, but since that kingdom is characterized by justice, peace, and joy in the Spirit [14.17], it cannot be inaugurated in the present by violence and hatred</em>.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sentiments and those outlined above will now be augmented by a brief examination of Roman 13:1-7 within the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<h2 id="scriptural-context-romans-129-1310">Scriptural Context: Romans 12:9-13:10</h2>
<p>The passage at hand only makes sense within the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10. Although Paul undoubtedly changes topics at 13:1, the thematic links between 13:1-7 and 12:9-21 are difficult to ignore. KakoV (“evil”) and agaqoV (“good”) occur in Rom 12:17, 21 and 13:3-4. Orgh (“wrath”) is mentioned in 12:19 and 13:4, 5. Also, conceptually, vengeance is mentioned in 12:19 and 13:4.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> It is therefore quite reasonable to see a connection between 13:1-7 and 12:9-21.</p>
<p>The links between this passage and the one immediately preceding it, however, should not overshadow the importance of the thematic verses earlier in 12:1-2. There Paul effectively redefines the people of God as no longer just Jews, but Gentiles as well. This is a common enough theme throughout the entire epistle and in almost all of Paul’s writings,<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> but in Romans 12:1-15:13, it is of particular importance.</p>
<p>Having spent the first eleven chapters of the epistle explaining the identity of the people of God as a mix of Jews and Gentiles and defending the covenant loyalty of God in the process, Paul now devotes chapters 12-15 to redefining the “rule of life” of the people of God.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> In 12:9-21, Paul proclaims “love as the fundamental moral imperative in human relationships,”<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> urging his readers to pursue harmony (12:16) and peace (12:18). He then redefines in 13:1-7 how the people of God in the church at Rome should relate to the power structures of the society in which they dwell.</p>
<p>Romans 12:9-21 is one of the most loosely-constructed passages in the entire epistle. This means that it would take quite a bit of time and space to comprehensively analyze the syntax and detailed meaning of the passage. However, some general observations are in order.</p>
<p>The thematic verse of this paragraph is 12:9 (NET)<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>, “Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.” From there, Paul emphasizes the important manifestations of genuine love: mutual devotion and eagerness in showing honor (12:10), enthusiastic spiritual service (12:11), hopeful joy and persistent prayer in the face of suffering (12:12), and hospitably meeting the needs of the saints (12:13). Harmony is commanded within and outside the church, extending even to persecutors (12:14, 16). Instead of responding in kind to their persecutors and therefore being “overcome by evil” (12:21a), Paul urges them to live peaceably (12:17-18), forbidding them from taking vengeance into their own hands (12:19). Instead, the Roman believers are to “overcome evil with good” (12:21b), and this is illustrated in 12:20, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will be heaping burning coals on his head.”</p>
<p>At this point after 12:21, most modern English readers of Scripture are confronted by a large “13” and perhaps a subject heading, such as “Submission to Civil Government.” The advantages of verse and chapter divisions for Bible reading and study are well-known. However, the chapter division here has had detrimental effects on the exegesis of this passage.</p>
<p>Although seemingly a very minor change, it puts undue emphasis on Paul’s supposed change of topic, prompting the interpretations of many that this is Paul’s comprehensive theology of church and state relations, ignoring the passage’s context and the historical situation of the original audience, who would have heard this epistle read without the explanation of a chapter division or sub-heading.</p>
<p>Romans 13:1-7 is most naturally read as the unpacking of the principles of 12:9-21, in the context of how Christians in Rome should behave in relation to the powers that governed the society in which they dwelt. It answers the implied question (after reading 12:9-21): “Paul, if we are to do these things (love genuinely, pursue harmony and peace, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good, etc.), how should this apply in regards to our relationship with the rulers of our city and empire?”</p>
<p>The specific rules that governed the theocracy of ancient Israel no longer held sway for the international and multi-ethnic body of Christ. As noted above, the situation in Rome, although relatively peaceful, was still quite tense within and outside of the church. Jews and Gentiles were struggling to remain unified in the Messiah in spite of their cultural differences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jews in Rome, only recently allowed back into the city, may have been culturally stigmatized as superstitious and unwanted. Tensions were building because of indirect taxation. And Jews in Palestine were growing more and more rebellious.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>It is not therefore hard to imagine why Paul felt the pastoral need to apply the principles of 12:9-21 to the realm of society and government. A “perfect storm” was brewing underneath the surface, one that could put the Christians in Rome at odds with not only each other but with the Roman Empire itself very quickly if the believers there tended towards promoting social unrest, perhaps due to an over-realized eschatology that would want to usher in the kingdom of God by overthrowing Roman rule. If the Christians in Rome made a wrong move, evil could quickly overcome them.</p>
<p>While a full analysis of the argument of the text at hand is beyond the scope of this essay, a brief trace of the thought-flow of Romans 13:1-7 will aid in comprehension of its contextually-appropriate meaning. The general command to submit to the authorities is found in 13:1a, and is reiterated in 13:5.</p>
<p>The first reason for this submission is that the authorities have been appointed by God (13:1b). Logically, then, those who oppose the authorities oppose “the ordinance of God” (13:2b). The consequence of disobeying the general command is therefore God’s judgment<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> (13:2b).</p>
<p>The second reason for submission is that the rulers are servants of God to commend good and to administer retribution to evil, although these two verses can also be seen as support for the claim that those who resist the authorities can expect judgment on earth<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> (13:3-4).</p>
<p>Paul then restates the main thesis of 13:1-4 in 13:5, urging his readers to submit because of “wrath” (they would face judgment if disobedient) and “conscience” (they would be opposing God’s ordinance). He then closes this paragraph with an appeal to the readers’ current practice of paying taxes in submission to the government (13:6), urging them therefore to continue respectfully in what they have already been doing (13:7).<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>When unhindered by the chapter division, it is easy to see how Romans 13:1-7 relates to 12:9-21. The genuine love commanded in 12:9a would be quite hard to apply to the impersonal institution of the Roman government. On the other hand, it would have been quite easy for the rebellious attitudes of the Jews in Palestine to seep into the Roman context, prompting the Roman Christians to rebel and try and institute the kingdom of God in opposition to Roman rule.</p>
<p>Paul steps in and applies the principles of non-violence, non-retribution, and enemy love (12:14, 17, 18-20) to the context of government and society. In order to “overcome evil with good” (12:21) when it came to the Roman powers, the believers in Rome were not to rebel violently or cause unnecessary civil unrest, but to submit to the governing authorities (13:1a) with the acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty over the said powers (13:1b).</p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to go to the other end of the spectrum and argue that Paul is urging his audience to give unthinking and critical approval of everything the Roman government did. As mentioned above, Paul was more than willing to critique governments and empires for the sake of God’s kingdom and the cause of Christ.</p>
<p>It would also be a mistake to argue that Romans 13:1-7 is a justification for the active participation in government activities (political office, warfare, etc.) both ancient and modern. Although God is still sovereign over modern nations, Paul’s argument here does not address the issue of active Christian participation in government because that was not on the radar of first-century Christian life in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Instead, Paul’s main point is that his readers should not revolt, but that they should instead stay out of trouble by obeying the authorities and participating in the basic constructs of their society (i.e. paying taxes).</p>
<p>The argument for placing 13:1-7 in the overarching context of Paul’s focus on genuine love in 12:9-13:10 is strengthened by his return to the topic of love in 13:8-10. After the sobering instruction to not rebel but to stay out of trouble and obey the governing authorities, Paul reminds his audience of the importance of love, not only of enemy (of which it could be strongly argued that the governing authorities were a subset!), but of neighbor.</p>
<p>This returns the Roman Christians’ focus to love as the central virtue of Christianity and the “fulfillment of the law” (13:8, 10). They were to faithfully follow Jesus the Messiah King, seeking to bring in his kingdom. But it was unthinkable to Paul to effect God’s kingdom in a way that ran against the grain of that kingdom of love, justice, and peace. Therefore, in the middle of exhortations to genuinely love one’s enemies and neighbors, Paul urges his audience to humbly obey their governing authorities so that they might remain faithful to their King’s calling as they went about his work in the city of Rome.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through the ignorance of the historical background of Paul’s epistle to the Romans as a whole and his instructions in Romans 13:1-7 in particular, the passage at hand has been grossly mis-read and mis-applied in numerous ways since its original composition. Instead of an argument for unthinking obedience to, approval of, and participation in governments past and present, Paul here argues for the Christians in Rome not to revolt against the empire in an attempt to fully usher in God’s kingdom, but to submit humbly to the Roman authorities as they sought to overcome evil with good.</p>
<p>Having an understanding of both the historical background and the context of this passage in the overall argument of the epistle yields an appropriately nuanced view of Paul’s pastoral concern for his audience expressed in these seven controversial verses. Although it is tempting to take this passage out of context and use it to justify opinions on everything from immigration to just war theory, the same hubris that Paul implicitly rebukes in these verses must be resisted if the Scriptures are to be heard and appropriated well.</p>
<p>While some may wish that Romans 13:1-7 had more to say regarding the relationship between church and state, the passage certainly cannot say less than the main points briefly described above. Romans 13:1-7 is not a condensed theology of church and state, but a specific historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, diverting them from rebellion and urging them towards humble submission in order to protect their testimony and thereby enhance their effectiveness in God’s redemptive mission.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> A full analysis of the legitimacy of an anti-imperial Pauline hermeneutic far exceeds the scope of this study. Wright (2004: 82-88 and 2005: 69-79) emphasizes what he sees to be Paul’s anti-imperial themes throughout his writings, and I am indebted to him for the concept of Jesus’ vs. Caesar’s lordship. For an even-handed overview and analysis of this topic, consult Kim (2008), who makes the case that a strong anti-imperial Pauline hermeneutic is difficult to maintain. Despite Kim’s conclusions, however, it seems unwise to completely ignore the implications of Christ’s lordship on both Roman believers in the first century and on North American ones today. The fact that Romans 13:1-7 is such a stumbling block to those in the anti-imperial camp and such an “anomaly” when compared with the implications of Paul’s anti-imperial passages (such as 1 Thess 5, alluded to by Wright [2005]) seems to necessitate a nuanced approach that hears the arguments of those on both sides of this theological debate.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> The commentaries and resources consulted in this study provided A.D. 57 as a consensus view of the date of composition of Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a> (Kim 2008: 37), who points to P. Stuhlmacher, <em>Paul’s Letter to the Romans: A Commentary</em>, trans. S. J. Hafeman (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox, 1994), 198-208; J. A. Fitzmyer, <em>Romans</em> AB 33 (New York: Doubleday, 1993), 662-63. Also, consult Dunn (1988: 768-69).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a> Ibid., 37.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a> The background information in this paragraph comes from the helpful discussion in Witherington III (2004: 304-6).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a> Consult the discussion in Kim (2008: 37) for a helpful counterbalance to the optimistic portrait painted by Witherington III (2004: 304-6). I am also very much indebted to the discussion as the source of the historical information in this paragraph.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a> Cf. Witherington III (2004: 307): “That Paul could say very different and negative things about the state when the state was malfunctioning at the end of Claudius’ reign seems clear enough from 1 and 2 Thessalonians, particularly in 2 Thessalonians 2.” And also consider Wright’s (2004: 86) insistence that Paul had the ability to critique human government: “…in those stories (his visit to Philippi in Acts 16, for instance, or his trial before the Jewish authorities in Acts 23), that precisely when the authorities are getting it all wrong and acting illegally or unjustly Paul has no hesitation in telling them their proper business and insisting that they should follow it.”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref8">[8]</a> <strong>Passionate Aside:</strong> The main problem, then, in applying this passage today, is a very narrow vision of what God’s kingdom entails. That is, “obey your government unless it tells you to do something contrary to the Word of God” is a common enough teaching in the church today, but our vision of God’s redemptive mission is so emaciated that it causes us to miss glaring issues of concern (immigration, warfare, racism, etc.) in our society today. We rape the Scriptures when Romans 13:1-7 is used to justify such ignorance of and even the active participation in streams of society, culture, and policy which go against the grain of God’s kingdom.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref9">[9]</a> (Wright 2005: 78-79), emphasis mine.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a> I am indebted to Dr. Robert Milliman and his blog-post <em>Love and War: Romans 13.1 – 7 in the Context of 12.9 – 13.10</em> (2011) for the initial idea of examining this passage in its context to avoid mis-readings of the text which have been used to justify everything from totalitarian regimes to Christian service in the military.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref11">[11]</a> Schreiner (1998: 678) provides these examples of textual and conceptual links between the two passages. Dunn (1988: 758) also mentions the phrases ekdikew / ekdikoV (12:19; 13:4) and pantwn anqrwpwn / pasin (12:17-18; 13:7) to provide evidence for a link between the two passages, before demonstrating links between Romans 2:7-11 and 13:3-4 in order to refute the claims of some that this passage is a non-Pauline insertion.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref12">[12]</a> I appeal to Dr. Chris Miller’s class notes from BENT 4110 – <em>Romans and Galatians</em> (Spring 2012), and also Wright’s work on Romans (2004) to prove this point, for a complete discussion of this common theme exceeds the scope of this essay. However, for an overview of this theme in Romans, Dunn (1988: 705) cites Rom 1:16-17; 2:15, 17, 28-29; 3:20, 29; 4:16; 9:8, 12; 11:6, 30-32.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref13">[13]</a> Dunn (1988: 705) sees chapters 12-15 as providing a replacement to Lev 18:5 (“this do and live”) as the rule of life for the people of God: “…‘the walk in newness of life’ as over against the walk in the ordinances of Israel’s law (6:4), the service in newness of Spirit as over against oldness of letter (7:6), the obedience of faith in accord with the Spirit fulfilling the requirement of the law unconfused with Jewish ‘works’ (8:4).”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref14">[14]</a> Ibid., 706.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref15">[15]</a> All Bible quotations, unless otherwise noted, come from the NET Bible.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref16">[16]</a> Here I summarize my conclusions from “Historical Background” above.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref17">[17]</a> Schreiner (1998: 679) notes that there is considerable debate as to whether this refers to the eschatological judgment of God or to judgment imposed by earthly rulers. He appeals to the structure of the text (gar in 3a) to conclude that the latter option is more likely.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref18">[18]</a> Ibid., 680.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref19">[19]</a> I am indebted to Moo (1996: 794) and Schreiner (1998: 680) for this overview of the passage’s argument.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx&#34;&gt;the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization’s agenda, and &lt;strong&gt;how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for.

I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism…&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx">the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24</a>, I’d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization’s agenda, and <strong>how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism</strong>.</p>
<p>I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism…</p>
<p>…and then I learned more about how to study the Bible.</p>
<p>And now I’m not so sure that people like Ken Ham are really about humbly submitting to what Scripture has to say. Instead, they seem to hold tightly to an anti-intellectual hermeneutic of suspicion and paranoia.It’s all about “us” vs. “them,” about building thick walls and banishing the “crazy liberals” from our midst. And the more I listen to the rhetoric, the more I’m convinced that <strong>anyone</strong> can become a crazy liberal, so long as they disagree with key figures such as Ken Ham about anything.</p>
<p>Consider the following quote from <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2011/11/03/anointed-evangelicals-and-authority-1-rjs/">a review of The Anointed: Evangelical Truth in a Secular Age (by R. Stephens and K. Giberson): </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ken Ham, with no scientific credentials, no credentials in biblical scholarship, no evidence, and no research program, has become the front person, the spokesman for a large segment of evangelicalism. He proves nothing, he asserts what he finds to be truth and tells a story to make it so. He is a charismatic speaker on a mission and has become for many the authority on the evil of evolution and the dishonesty of modern science. Ken Ham and his organization Answers in Genesis have become “<em>powerful shapers of popular opinion in America’s vast evangelical subculture.</em>”</p>
<p>Ken Ham is an anointed and respected authority in much of American evangelicalism and fundamentalism.</p>
<p>One of the premises of Stephens and Giberson is that the broader evangelical culture has become enamored of the charismatic individual who can tell a good story, do it in a flashy and entertaining fashion, and has a message easily reduced to simple black and white points. Ken Ham is such an individual.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why is Ken Ham believed?</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People like Ken Ham and AiG claim to have a <strong>high</strong> view of Scripture and to hold to a “literal” reading… but in reality, I think that they have a <strong>low</strong> view of Scripture because they are unwilling to even consider that certain passages were <em>not</em> written to answer the questions we might like them to answer for us! If we don’t even try to approach the text <em>on its own terms</em>, then I would argue that we’re being <em>unfaithful</em> to Scripture.</p>
<p>For those of you still reading who don’t think I’m a crazy liberal yet (I can assure you, I’m not), consider the following resources as first steps in moving beyond Ken Ham, AiG, and the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism, to what Scripture actually has to say about creation!</p>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation-and-redemption-christ-and-new-creation&#34;&gt;CREATION AND REDEMPTION: CHRIST AND NEW CREATION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Throughout the New Testament, the main use of creation theology is to link creation with redemption, resulting in the praise of the Creator through the Creator-Redeemer, Jesus the Messiah. However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions.[\[1\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1) The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple.[\[2\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2) Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17).&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation.&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4&#34;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20).&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5&#34;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; (poievw).&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6&#34;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h1 id="creation-and-redemption-christ-and-new-creation">CREATION AND REDEMPTION: CHRIST AND NEW CREATION</h1>
<div>Throughout the New Testament, the main use of creation theology is to link creation with redemption, resulting in the praise of the Creator through the Creator-Redeemer, Jesus the Messiah. However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions.[\[1\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1) The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple.[\[2\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2) Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.
<p>The New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]</a> Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]</a> Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both <em>made</em> (poievw).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Doxologically, the link between creation and redemption is hard to overemphasize, for it provides the explanation, impetus, and goal of worship. By creating anew through Jesus the Messiah, the perfect <em>Eikon</em><a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn7">[7]</a> or <em>Tselem</em> (image) of God who has defeated Sin and Death, Elohim has begun to renew his holy temple, even as it yearns for full release from its bondage to decay.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn8">[8]</a> This act of re-creation begins in the crucifixion and resurrection of the Messiah, reversing Death itself and displaying Jesus Christ as the pioneer of a new humanity, one untouched by God’s cosmic enemies. It continues in the Church, as the priest-kings are re-created <em>in Christ</em> <em>and his resurrection</em> into a new race of people able to worship their Maker by participating in the renewal of his universe, by once again extending his rule throughout the sacred realm, and by living in right relationship to him, to creation, to each other, and to themselves as they await the return of their Creator, Redeemer, and King, Jesus the Messiah.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>In light of these things, to relegate the manifold and rich uses of creation theology throughout Scripture to an ongoing origins debate which is thoroughly <em>detached</em> from the biblical text would be a tragedy. At the risk of oversimplification, the myriad creation themes in the Scriptures all lead to one common goal: doxology, as a brief analysis of just three of those themes has shown. Creation as temple provides the parameters for worship of the Creator, setting the foundation for humanity’s relational role as the priest-kings of Elohim. Creation as chaos reorients that worship toward humility and wonder in the midst of a purposefully untamed and sometimes dangerous temple, bringing the wildly complex beauty of Yahweh’s creation to bear on the human experience. Finally, creation as redemption ties the entire story together, explaining the Creator’s refusal to allow Sin and Death to drag his temple back to the watery depths of non-functionality. He has chosen to create anew, to redeem every aspect of his holy temple, from its priest-kings to its wild beauties, through Jesus the Messiah, the eternal intersection of Creator, creation, and redemption. This process of new creation began at the crucifixion and resurrection, continues through the Church, and anticipates the eschaton, when Sin and Death will not only be defeated, but utterly vanquished. The holy temple will again be filled with perfect worship, forever.</p>
<p><strong>It is <em>because of</em> and <em>within</em> this story of creation and new creation that we worship our Maker. Biblical creation theology inescapably leads to doxology.</strong></p>

<p>Much of the chaos in the universe can be ascribed to the infiltration of Sin and Death as described in Genesis 3. However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God’s creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.</p>
<p>Yahweh’s “whirlwind speeches” in Job 38-41 are the longest sustained reflection on creation outside of Gen 1-3, and they depict a radically non-anthropocentric cosmos where the ferocity and freedom of non-human creatures is celebrated.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> Whereas other passages seem to portray humanity as the center of God’s attention, <a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2">[2]</a> in Job 38-41 Yahweh only mentions humans in passing, choosing instead to focus on the wildest aspects of his creation, such as the Behemoth (40:15-24), the Leviathan (41:1-34), and the Sea (38:8-11).</p>
<p>The Sea, in fact, bears special mention, for it was a symbol of chaos in the ANE, and in several ANE cosmogonies it had to be slain by the gods in the process of creation.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> Most notably, in the Babylonian <em>Enuma Elish</em>, the creator-goddess <em>Tiamat</em> (Sumerian for “salt water, deep, chaos”) is violently defeated by the warrior-god Marduk, who constructs the universe from her bloody corpse.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]</a> In the Genesis account, we see the cognate Hebrew term: תְּהוֹם (<em>tehom</em>), the “watery depths” of Gen 1:2. Although there are echoes of the Marduk-Tiamat battle elsewhere in Scripture,<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]</a> the struggle is not mentioned here.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]</a> Furthermore, in Job 38, the Sea is not a chaotic force of evil defeated by God, but a powerful force which is <em>born</em> as God acts as midwife.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn7">[7]</a> Yahweh sets a boundary for the Sea, but he also gives its chaotic waters a place in the created order, revealing that his creation, though orderly, is not a perfectly safe or tame place for humans in its beauty and freedom.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The creation theology of the whirlwind speeches shows that “humanity has a place in God’s creation…not of dominion but of humility and of wonder.”<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn9">[9]</a>The inherent chaos and complexity of creation necessitate a humble reorientation in the priest-kings’ worship of their Creator. Nevertheless, although God’s temple is wild by design, Sin and Death continue to cut against the grain of Yahweh’s creative purposes, distorting even the intrinsic beauty of creation’s chaotic aspects. All is not as it should be in Elohim’s holy temple. Creation cries out for a Redeemer.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>In many conservative evangelical circles, biblical creation theology has been hijacked and eclipsed by the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology. Waltke summarizes the problem well: “Instead of metaphysical questions that shape culture, questions about dinosaurs, a young earth theory, and such dominate the evangelical landscape. This is unfortunate.”<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2">[2]</a> Nevertheless, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Scripture’s use of creation themes, whether the evangelical community gives them appropriate attention or not. Unfortunately, a comprehensive analysis of biblical creation theology, a field fertile enough to provide lifetimes of work and study, far exceeds the purview of this essay.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> However, a brief analysis of the motifs of creation as temple, chaos, and redemption will show that the overarching use of creation theology in Scripture is to bring about the praise of the Creator. Biblical creation theology, properly understood, leads to doxology.</p>
<h1 id="creation-as-gods-temple">CREATION AS GOD’S TEMPLE</h1>
<p>A fitting place to begin this study is the creation account of Gen 1:1-2:3, which depicts the cosmos as Elohim’s holy temple.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]</a> Although other ancient cosmogonies prominently feature a particular location or building as the nexus for worship of the respective deities, Gen 1 contains no such element. <a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]</a> Indeed, other creation accounts in the ANE associated the lack of a temple with the “precosmic condition.” That is, creation (the expression of divine authority) was not regarded as complete until the temple (the location for the implementation of divine authority) was constructed.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]</a> The cosmogony of Gen 1 thus seems strange when compared to its ANE counterparts, but this anomaly reveals the main emphasis of the passage: the entire universe is the sacred dwelling place of Elohim.</p>
<p>The structure of the narrative lends itself to this “cosmic temple” interpretation. In the first three days of creation (1:1-13), Elohim calls three “spheres” into being, relating to the main “functions” of life: light/darkness (time), water/sky (weather), and land/sea (food).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn7">[7]</a> He then proceeds to create in days four through six (1:14-31), assigning the “functionaries” of creation their respective roles and spheres.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn8">[8]</a> The scene is then set for the climax of the narrative, which is not the creation of humans, but the installation of the Sabbath (2:1-3).</p>
<p>If the connection between this Sabbath rest and creation as temple is not apparent to the modern reader, it is due to a lack of knowledge of where divine rest takes place.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn9">[9]</a> Upon reading that Elohim “rested” (Gen 2:2), the ancient reader would have immediately recognized that this was taking place in a divine <em>temple</em>, the exclusively-appropriate place for any god to rest and proceed to rule his domain from the throne.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn10">[10]</a> However, the English “rest” does not fully reflect the meaning of the Hebrew “שָׁבַּת, <em>shabbat,</em>” which refers to “the completion of certain activity with which one had been occupied.”<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn11">[11]</a> After completing the creative transition from non-functional chaotic waters to a stable and functional temple, Elohim “rests,” and the cosmos may now operate normally, with him in control.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn12">[12]</a> The clearest Scriptural compilation of all these ideas occurs in Isa 66:1-2a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what the Lord says:</p>
<p>“<em>The heavens are my throne</em> and <em>the earth is my footstool</em>. Where then is <em>the house</em> you will build for me? Where is <em>the place where I will</em> <em>rest</em>? My hand made them; that is how they came to be,” says the Lord.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>

<p>Doxologically, the creation of the universe as Elohim’s temple provides the impetus and parameters for appropriate worship of the Creator, whose “majestic splendor fills the entire earth” (Isa 6:3). As the only inhabitants of the cosmic temple created in the image (צֶ֫לֶם, <em>tselem</em>) of Elohim, humans were created to function as “priest-kings”, extending his rule and dominion throughout the entire sacred realm of creation (Gen 1:26-28).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn14">[14]</a> Through the lens of creation as temple, therefore, worship is relational, designed to be mediated by Elohim’s beloved priest-kings as they live in perfect relationship with him, with each other, and with the rest of creation, a full vision of the divine rest appropriate to Elohim’s cosmic temple.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>However, there is a tension between creation as it is now experienced and as it has just been described.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn16">[16]</a> Genesis 3 gives the tragic explanation: Sin and Death, God’s cosmic enemies, have infected and affected every layer of the cosmic temple,<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn17">[17]</a> pulling the universe backwards, so to speak, toward the chaotic watery depths from which it was called into being. If the temple is no longer “safe,” is appropriate worship still possible?</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;romans-11-17&#34;&gt;Romans 1:1-17&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t catch anything else from what I’m about to say, remember this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is righteous. He is just. He is faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has proven himself faithful to his promises of restoring the world, working through his faithful Son, the Messiah, to bring about both our faith in and our faithfulness to him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.</em></p>
<h1 id="romans-11-17">Romans 1:1-17</h1>
<p>If you don’t catch anything else from what I’m about to say, remember this:</p>
<p>God is righteous. He is just. He is faithful.</p>
<p>God has proven himself faithful to his promises of restoring the world, working through his faithful Son, the Messiah, to bring about both our faith in and our faithfulness to him.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain this further.</p>
<p>But first, the objections:</p>
<h1 id="romans-118-32">Romans 1:18-32</h1>
<p>See, at first glance, the big idea above seems ridiculous. God is faithful? Have you seen the world recently? It’s corrupt to the core. Idolatry, sexual immorality, violence, deception, hostility, etc. Because people refused to believe that God is who he says he is, Sin and Death have infected and affected every layer of human existence. If God is truly righteous, why is his world so unrighteous?</p>
<p>(For a theological essay about what the Bible is and why it’s important, read <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/on-scripture/">this piece.</a>)</p>
<h1 id="romans-21-29">Romans 2:1-29</h1>
<p>Furthermore, look at his “chosen people,” the Jews! They are no better than anyone else, despite their privileged position as the ones through whom God promised to work.</p>
<p>They have failed to understand that their identity as God’s people was more inward than outward, and by boasting about their possession of God’s law (instead of allowing God to change them from the inside out), they have become just as unrepentant and stubborn as the rest of the world!</p>
<h1 id="romans-31-8">Romans 3:1-8</h1>
<p>Doesn’t Israel’s utter failure to have faith in God and fulfill their role as a conduit of God’s grace to the entire world mean that God’s plan and promises have failed?</p>
<p>No. Just because some of the Jews failed does not mean all of them have.</p>
<p>And it especially does not mean that God has.</p>
<p>He is still faithful and righteous. But more on that later…</p>
<h1 id="romans-39-20">Romans 3:9-20</h1>
<p>Even though everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, is corrupt…</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Sin and Death, God’s cosmic enemies, have polluted his creation…</p>
<p>Although Scripture itself testifies that we are all unfaithful…</p>
<p>Although the Law which was supposed to guide us in our pursuit of God has only highlighted just how broken we are and how far we have fallen…</p>
<h1 id="romans-321-31">Romans 3:21-31</h1>
<p>Despite all of these things, God is righteous.</p>
<p>God has revealed his covenant faithfulness to us through Jesus the Messiah, the True and Faithful Israelite through whom God has kept his redemptive promises. Through his death, the Messiah has absorbed the wrath of God which our unfaithfulness merited. What’s more, he has reconciled us to God and made possible the truly human life, one which honors God by living in perfect relationship with him and the rest of his creation. Through the Messiah, God is proving his faithfulness in redeeming the entire world.</p>
<h1 id="romans-41-25">Romans 4:1-25</h1>
<p>However, you’ll notice I said “made possible” above. This is because the benefits of what the Messiah has done are only appropriated to us, as they always have been, through faith. The unrepentant Jews made the mistake of assuming that their cultural identity of Torah-obedience was the source of their identity as God’s people. Not so! Look at Abraham! The righteousness of God was appropriated to him because of his faith. After all, he wasn’t even circumcised yet! Therefore, just as Abraham, we all receive the benefits of and incorporation into God’s redemptive mission through faith, and not through the Law. The key is putting our faith in the faithful Messiah.</p>
<h1 id="romans-51-21">Romans 5:1-21</h1>
<p>Pardon me, but this topic is so important that I’m going to run with it for awhile!</p>
<p>See, this combination of the Messiah’s faithfulness and our faith in him means that God has declared us faithful (righteous). Did you hear that? Not only is God faithful, but despite our unfaithfulness, he declares us faithful as well because of his faithful Son and our faith in him!</p>
<p>This means that we now have PEACE (and not enmity) with God!</p>
<p>This is possible because, get this, at every point at which our father Adam (and everyone ever since) failed, the Messiah has perfectly succeeded!</p>
<p>Before placing our faith in the Messiah’s faithfulness, we were all “in Adam.” That is, we were at enmity with God because of our unfaithfulness to him which deserved condemnation. However, the Messiah’s faithful obedience didn’t just undo our unrighteousness, putting us back on level ground. Instead, it has taken us to the soaring heights of God’s own righteousness! We are now “in the Messiah”!</p>
<h1 id="romans-61-25">Romans 6:1-25</h1>
<p>But that’s not the only transfer that’s happened! Being moved from “in Adam” to “in the Messiah” also means that we’ve been moved from the Death which Sin brings to the Life which the Messiah offers to us! While we were “in Adam,” we were slaves to Sin and Death, dominated by them and without freedom. However, now that we are “in the Messiah,” we have choices! Free choices! Sin still brings death, but we have been set free and we have the ability and opportunity to make proper choices and live life to its fullest by being truly human, giving glory to our gracious Creator!</p>
<h1 id="romans-71-6">Romans 7:1-6</h1>
<p>All of this has radically changed our relationship to God’s Law. Through the transfer from Adam to Messiah, from Death to Life, we have been set free from the Law’s condemnation! We can now live a life where God’s Spirit writes the Law on our hearts!</p>
<h1 id="romans-77-25">Romans 7:7-25</h1>
<p>See, beforehand, while we were still “in Adam,” the Law didn’t really help us out. Because of our initial unfaithfulness, the Law highlighted our brokenness and need for a Messiah Savior. It condemned us in the sight of a holy God. Although there was nothing wrong with the Law itself, there was something profoundly wrong with us, and the Law was very good at showing that!</p>
<h1 id="romans-81-30">Romans 8:1-30</h1>
<p>But our faith in Jesus the faithful Messiah changes things. As I mentioned above, we have now been set free from the Law’s old condemnation! The Spirit of God writes God’s law on our very heart. Not only that, the Spirit also gives us the power to live a life which is pleasing to God, in right relationship with our Creator and all of his creation. The Spirit is both our GPS and our engine. Therefore, we no longer have to worry about being condemned by the Law, because the Spirit guides and enables us to fulfill the Law’s requirements as those who are “in the Messiah.”</p>
<h1 id="romans-831-39">Romans 8:31-39</h1>
<p>Take a moment to think about all I have said so far. Despite the unfaithfulness of all humanity, God has proven himself faithful, most notably through his faithful Son, the Messiah. Look at all God has done for us and given to us through the Messiah! Consider the depths of his love for us! Nothing can separate us from the love of God and the love of our Messiah! God is indeed righteous. Although the plan has not yet been fully accomplished, he is well on his way toward redeeming all that he has made.</p>
<p>However, we still haven’t covered everything. If you’ll remember, there’s still that tricky bit about the failure of God’s chosen people. Even though God has done all of this for us through the Messiah, doesn’t the failure of Israel damage his righteousness?</p>
<p>Can God still be fully faithful if it appears his specific promises to/about Israel have failed?</p>
<p>Despite the apparent failure of Israel, God is still righteous and faithful!</p>
<p>Consider three reasons why:</p>
<h1 id="romans-91-29">Romans 9:1-29</h1>
<p>Firstly, if you will remember, God never promised to use every single ethnic Jew as one of his chosen people. Consider Abraham’s descendants, they were numbered through Isaac and not Ishmael. Similarly, Isaac’s descendants were numbered through Jacob and not Esau. This does not mean that God is unfair, for he is not obligated to show mercy to anyone! It also does not mean that God was eternally unloving to those he did not choose at specific times to work through in Israel’s history toward the coming of the Messiah! The main point isn’t that Ishmael and Esau were damned to hell. It’s that God has never promised to choose and use every single ethnic descendant of Abraham. It is therefore unfair to act as if God has promised to always use all physical Jews. As I alluded to before, the *true* Jews have always been so inwardly, not just outwardly.</p>
<h1 id="romans-930-1021">Romans 9:30-10:21</h1>
<p>Secondly, let’s not blame God for what the Israelites themselves failed to do! Just because many (but not all!) Israelites have failed to have faith throughout the years does NOT mean that God is no longer faithful. Although God never promised to choose and use every ethnic Jew as one of his chosen people, all Jews did have more than enough opportunities to place their faith in God and live in faithfulness to him! However, as mentioned toward the beginning, they failed to realize the key role that faith played in the process. They boasted in their ethnic/national identity of Torah-following instead of boasting in the faithfulness of their God and fulfilling their priestly duties to the world. Please do not blame this failure on God. He has remained faithful and gracious.</p>
<h1 id="romans-111-36">Romans 11:1-36</h1>
<p>Thirdly, and finally, the story is not yet over! The failure/rejection of Israel is neither total nor permanent. God has always preserved a faithful remnant. That is, there has always existed, within ethnic Israel, the true Israel, the faithful people of God. Despite Israel’s failures, there has always been a remnant, graciously preserved by God to accomplish his purposes. But this remnant will not always be partial! There will come a day in the future when God will do through Israel abundantly above and beyond what he has ever done before. A complete, full generation of Israelites will someday be rescued and used by God to bless the world, completely dispelling any notions that God has somehow failed his people. Despite Israel’s faithlessness, God has remained, and will always remain, faithful and righteous.</p>
<p>This is more than even I can comprehend!</p>
<p>Praise be to God!</p>
<h1 id="romans-12">Romans 12</h1>
<p>In view of God’s righteousness, his faithfulness in redeeming the world and putting it back together again through his faithful Son, the Messiah, let’s consider what it looks like to join him in his redemptive mission! If you’ll remember, our faith in the faithfulness of the Messiah is designed to bring about our own faithfulness as well!</p>
<p>What does this faithfulness look like, in response to all God has done?</p>
<p>It starts with a refusal to conform to the world’s ways of life. Remember my mentioning of the consequences of Sin and Death earlier? Well, in addition to those things, you must also refuse to be conformed to the ways of pride and division. Instead of conformity, pursue transformation. Allow the Spirit of God to renew your mind, and it will revolutionize your relationships. Pursue things like unity, genuine love, harmony, and peace. In all circumstances, even when you are being persecuted, refuse to be overcome by evil. Instead, overcome evil with good.</p>
<h1 id="romans-13">Romans 13</h1>
<p>This all more-or-less makes sense when applied to fellow believers and neighbors, but when we start talking about persecutors and the government, things get tricky!</p>
<p>The crucial thing to remember is that, although God is in the process of invading this fallen world to establish his righteous kingdom, this does NOT mean that you should go violently overthrowing the Roman Empire, or any other empire for that matter! This is because the King we follow stands for, as I’ve just mentioned, genuine love, harmony, and peace. This rules-out violent rebellion and vengeful retaliation.</p>
<p>I’m NOT arguing, by any means, that you should mindlessly participate in the currents of society and government which go against God’s kingdom. Stay alert and faithfully follow the Messiah!</p>
<p>However, instead of trying to overthrow the Empire, you should reasonably and respectfully participate in society. Trust God’s sovereignty over human affairs by submitting to the authorities and paying your taxes. God’s kingdom will be established from the inside out!</p>
<p>These things are all related. The same characteristics of your love for each other and for your neighbors should be applied to persecutors and the governing authorities. If “in Adam,” then this stuff sounds ridiculous. However, we are “in the Messiah,” and this radically changes everything. Let us live in LOVE, the fulfillment of God’s law, as we await our Messiah’s return…</p>
<h1 id="romans-14-15">Romans 14-15</h1>
<p>…which brings me to the most pressing issue I wish to address.</p>
<p>See, all of this means very little if it does not impact how you Jews and Gentiles relate to each other within the body of the Messiah, the Church. Now that you are both accepted as full members of God’s holy people, I realize that there has been quite a bit of social tension created, specifically with regards to food! While I could give you an apostolically-prescribed menu, that would defeat the purpose, because my main goal (and God’s main goal, for that matter) in this is to see you unified, harmoniously working together as Jews and Gentiles for God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Here’s why this is important. If you allow something as simple and amoral as food to fragment you, think of what a slap in the face that is to the Messiah, who moved heaven and earth to defeat Sin and Death and reconcile you all to God.</p>
<p>Sin and Death destroy relationships.</p>
<p>Our Messiah destroyed Sin and Death.</p>
<p>If you, then, go back and destroy relationships over things such as food, you are effectively undoing the work of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Do not let this be so! Overwhelm each other with grace and love as you pursue unity!</p>
<p>Use these principles within the body to settle all further and future differences as well, for your unity and love for one another prove that God’s mission is working in the world!</p>
<h1 id="romans-16">Romans 16</h1>
<p>I am confident that God has been and will continue to be at work in your lives. Deeply consider the things I have said to you. But take heart, for we serve a God who loves human beings, and that is why he has chosen to use us in his redemptive mission!</p>
<p>Just don’t forfeit this precious role by allowing people to cause dissensions among you!</p>
<p>I have now come full circle in my argument.</p>
<p>Despite our failures, God is righteous in his mission of redeeming the world through his Son, the Messiah, and through his people, the Church, of which you are a part.</p>
<p>His faithfulness to us through the Messiah is designed to bring about (through our faith in him) our own faithfulness and obedience to him.</p>
<p>May our righteous God and our faithful Messiah be praised and given glory forever!</p>
<p>Amen!</p>

      <title>What the Bible Says About Poverty: The Book of Proverbs</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-poverty-and-wealth&#34;&gt;Introduction: Poverty and Wealth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction-poverty-and-wealth">Introduction: Poverty and Wealth</h1>
<p>In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.</p>
<p>Modern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.</p>
<p>However, one can effortlessly go through daily life in middle class America without giving much thought or care to the billions of people living in poverty worldwide. Furthermore, one can even profess faith in Jesus Christ and regularly attend an average evangelical church in the United States without being prompted to pay the poor, underprivileged, and oppressed of this world any mind.</p>
<p>In this milieu of wealth and poverty existing side by side in an atmosphere of confusion and apathy, the book of Proverbs provides relevant insights into the nature of poverty, the nature of Yahweh, and how his people should respond to it.</p>
<p>(For more on how Christians should think about poverty and wealth, see my essay <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/christians-and-wealth/">“Christians and Wealth.”</a>)</p>
<h2 id="descriptions-of-poverty-effects-and-causes">Descriptions of Poverty: Effects and Causes</h2>
<p>Many proverbs are devoted to describing the harsh realities of poverty, showing that the Hebrew sages were well aware of its existence and characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
<p>These proverbs frequently describe the poor in direct contrast to the wealthy. Consider Proverbs 10:15:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A rich man’s wealth is in his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The force of the antithetical parallelism of this verse is hard to overlook. Whybray explains that the main point “is that wealth protects the rich from the vicissitudes of life, while the poor, having no resources to fall back on, are easily vulnerable to total disaster” (1994, 165).</p>
<p>The word used for “poor” here is <em><strong>dal</strong>.</em> While Whybray states that this word is synonymous with the other Hebrew terms for “poor” (<em>˓ānı̂, ˒ebyôn,</em> and <em>rāš</em>)in Proverbs (1994, 165), <em>The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament</em> (TWOT) differentiates <em>dal</em> from the other three, saying that “unlike <em>˓ānı̂</em>, <em>dal</em> does not emphasize pain or oppression; unlike <em>˒ebyôn</em>, it does not primarily emphasize need, and unlike <em>rāš</em>, it represents those who lack rather than the destitute.” <em>Dal</em> refers to <strong>the lack of both material and social resources</strong> (Harris, et al. 1999).</p>
<p>This lack of social resources can be seen in the proverbs that describe how poverty affects relationships. Proverbs 14:20 says that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The poor is disliked even by his neighbor, but the rich has many friends.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This same theme is reiterated in chapter 19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wealth brings many new friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend” (19:4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expanded across two verses, it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Many seek the favor of a generous man, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. All a poor man’s brothers hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him!” (19:6-7a).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These three proverbs contrast the social standings of the wealthy and the impoverished. Alden’s comment on 14:20 is apt when he says that “the unfortunate truth [is] that greed is a more compelling trait than generosity; people are more eager to have rich friends than poor ones” (1983, 114).</p>
<p>Proverbs 19:6-7a expands upon this, describing how people are naturally drawn to relationships that give them material benefit. It is rare, however, to find people who are drawn to relationships that would cost them materially. Even a poor man’s family members “hate him”!</p>
<p>Bridges says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As the winter brooks, filled from the opening springs and the torrents from heaven, are dried up and vanish before the summer heat; so these friends of the poor go far from him, cold, distant, and vanishing in the day of his calamity” (1987, cf. 1846, 312).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Materially and socially, poverty wreaks havoc on the lives of those it entraps.</p>
<h3 id="causes">Causes</h3>
<p>Given the terrible effects and characteristics of poverty, Proverbs naturally contains many admonitions to avoid its causes.</p>
<p>Causes of poverty listed in Proverbs include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>a “slack hand” (laziness) (10:4),</li>
<li>ignorance of instruction (13:18),</li>
<li>endless talk (without toil/labor) (14:23),</li>
<li>hastiness (21:15),</li>
<li>the love of pleasure (21:17),</li>
<li>drunkenness and gluttony (23:21),</li>
<li>worthless pursuits (28:19),</li>
<li>and stinginess (28:22).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of particular interest is the repetition of the warning against excessive slumber if one is to avoid poverty (6:10-11; 20:13; 23:21; 24:33-34).</p>
<p>Proverbs 6:10-11 and 24:33-34 include the almost verbatim admonition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleep (as compared with labor) might give the initial benefits of rest and relaxation, but when developed into an excessive habit, it can have disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>John Chrysostom comments upon 6:11:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is work at first difficult? Then look to its results. Is idleness sweet? Then consider what comes out of it in the end. So let us look not at the beginning of things, but let us also see where they end up” (Wright 2005, 50).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach perhaps summarizes most of the practical warnings in Proverbs about avoiding poverty. <strong>What initially seems like the easiest and most comfortable choice will rarely, if ever, lead to success.</strong></p>
<p>Set apart from the practical warnings of avoiding poverty, however, is Proverbs 22:16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verb “oppress” here is the term <em>˓ā∙šǎq</em>, meaning “mistreat, i.e., treat a disadvantaged member of society unjustly with the effect of causing one to suffer ill-treatment” (Swanson 1997).</p>
<p>Although the Hebrew of this verse is quite difficult and there is little concurrence among commentators as to its proper interpretation (Whybray 1994, 322-323), the sense of it seems to be that <strong>the end result of oppressing the impoverished for material gain is only further poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>Proverbs 30:14 comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses make the transition from descriptions of poverty to responses to its existence, highlighting the uncomfortable truth that <strong>improper treatment of the poor can bring disaster</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="responses-to-poverty-yahweh-and-the-poor">Responses to Poverty: Yahweh and the Poor</h2>
<p>It is clear that Proverbs gives its readers a thorough understanding of the dreadfulness of poverty and the importance of avoiding it.</p>
<p>However, this understanding does little to inform the audience of <strong>how we should respond to the existence of poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>The surest foundation for a proper response to poverty is undoubtedly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the character of Yahweh with regards to the oppressed and impoverished</span>.</p>
<p>Consider Proverbs 14:31:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first line of this proverb is echoed in 17:5a, and the second (seemingly unrelated) line of 17:5, “he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished,” has been taken by some commentators to refer to those who rejoice over not just calamity in general, but specifically the ruin of the poor (Whybray 1994, 255 and Clifford 1999, 164).</p>
<p>If this is the case, then these two proverbs taken together make the same point with both a positive promise and a negative warning. Clifford states the main point particularly well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The dignity of each human being comes from being created by God. Contempt towards anyone insults the person’s maker. The example of the poor person, the type perhaps least likely to gain respect, is used to dramatize the point. Every human being, irrespective of wealth, is worthy of respect” (1999, 164).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same point is made in Proverbs 22:2, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and also in 29:13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our treatment of the poor needs to be based upon the fact that they have been made in the image of Yahweh and are therefore worthy of dignity and respect.</strong> To deny them the treatment that each and every human being deserves is not just stinginess, it is <strong>an insult and an offense to the Creator.</strong></p>
<p>However, Proverbs goes further than appeals to imago Dei in its teachings about our treatment of the poor.</p>
<p>Atkinson says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The oppression of the poor is both a violation of someone who should be respected because he or she bears the image of the Creator, and also an attitude which does not reflect the character of the Creator, who is himself on the side of the poor” (1996, 111).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 22:22-23 delivers a stunningly vivid warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not rob the poor, because he is poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate, for the LORD will plead their cause and rob of life those who rob them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader is told to not take justice from the poor because they have the LORD as their defender at the gate (the site of legal proceedings). “The poor, by not having human protectors, have Yahweh as their protector. Paradoxically, their poverty gives them a more powerful protector than the rich could afford” (Clifford 1999, 207).</p>
<p>This gives a glimpse into a thematic truth of Scripture that has been called God’s “bias to the poor.” Atkinson quotes Karl Barth to further explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The human righteousness required by God and established in obedience – the righteousness which according to Amos 5:24 should pour down as a mighty stream – has necessarily the character of a vindication of right in favour of the threatened innocent, the oppressed poor, widows, orphans, and aliens.</p>
<p>For this reason, in the relations and events in the life of his people, God always takes his stand unconditionally and passionately on this side and this side alone: against the lofty and on behalf of the lowly; against those who enjoy right and privilege and on behalf of those who are denied it and deprived of it” (1996, 111-112, cf. Barth, <em>Church Dogmatics</em> II/1 [T.&amp;T. Clark, 1957], p. 387)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>God’s heart for and even bias toward the poor extends well beyond the book of Proverbs</strong>. If one pays close attention, it is readily apparent that Scripture is saturated with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahweh intervened to save his people from the oppression and poverty they suffered in at the hands of the Egyptians (cf. Exodus 3:7-9).</li>
<li>He made his frustration at his people’s improper treatment and distortion of the impoverished and the needy known through the prophets (cf. Isaiah 10:1-3; Jeremiah 5:26-29; 7:5-7; Amos 2:7; 4:1; 5:10-15; 6:4-7; Micah 2:2).</li>
<li>Jesus the Messiah cited his own mission as one that was inextricably tied to the poor and oppressed (cf. Luke 4:16-21).</li>
<li>The final judgment will be executed (at least partially so) with regards to the treatment (or mistreatment) of the poor and the needy (cf. Matthew 25:31-46).</li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture makes it abundantly clear that <strong>God’s heart is for the impoverished, destitute, and oppressed</strong>.</p>
<p>It is important to establish this truth well in order to rightly proceed in our actions and attitudes toward the poor and the oppressed. This is because <strong>it is entirely too easy to think of God’s actions and attitudes as being most closely aligned with people who are just like us.</strong></p>
<p>However, for the vast majority of Christians in the United States who live life in relatively extravagant comfort and ease, it comes as somewhat of a shock that God’s bias might actually be <em><strong>against</strong></em> us if we do not take this issue seriously!</p>
<p>Proverbs reflects that what is at stake here is much more than just our consciences, the minor twangs of guilt or moments of self-righteousness we too often experience in our infrequent interactions with the poor.</p>
<h2 id="responses-to-poverty-consequences-and-rewards">Responses to Poverty: Consequences and Rewards</h2>
<p>The teachings in Proverbs regarding the treatment of the poor can be divided into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>those that display negative consequences for improper treatment,</li>
<li>those that display positive rewards for proper treatment,</li>
<li>and those that juxtapose the two.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h3>
<p>Proverbs 21:13 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever closes his ears to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The frightening reciprocity of this verse hits hard when, in our culture, we are too often distracted by other things which are “more important” than attending to the needs of the poor. When we find ourselves in a moment of dire need, how can we expect to be answered if we have not answered the needy when we were able to do so?</p>
<p>Another warning against mistreating the poor that includes a form of retribution against the offender is Proverbs 28:8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit gathers is for him who is generous to the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whybray claims that the word for “interest” refers to “interest which was levied by deduction from the original loan but which had to be repaid in full,” and that “profit” refers to “an additional charge levied on repayment” (1994, 391).</p>
<p>The point is that <strong>money taken from the poor will not do its wicked owner any good,</strong> and has the potential to end up in the hands of righteous men which will in turn help to meet the needs of the poor.</p>
<h3 id="positive-rewards">Positive Rewards</h3>
<p>In addition, Proverbs contains several verses that positively portray, and thereby encourage, generosity towards the poor and preservation of their justice.</p>
<p>Consider Proverbs 19:17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proverb promises a reward to those who treat the poor with generosity. However, the main point is not to treat them with benevolence out of desire for a reward.</p>
<p>Whybray captures the point well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“there is no idea here of a quid pro quo: no intention to encourage generosity simply for the reward which it will bring. The underlying thought is that generosity is characteristic of a person who is righteous; and the proverb reflects the basic belief that righteousness is, and ought to be, materially rewarded” (1994, 282).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A virtually identical point is made in Proverbs 22:9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the well-known wise woman discussed in chapter 31 “opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy” (31:20). <strong>Giving generously to the poor is a mark of a righteous person, one whose life will be blessed by Yahweh.</strong></p>
<h3 id="combinations">Combinations</h3>
<p>Finally, some proverbs combine the negative and positive aspects of the previously mentioned verses through antithetical parallelism.</p>
<p>A prime example is Proverbs 14:21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner, but blessed is he who is generous to the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse highlights the benefits of generosity against the backdrop of the consequences of scorning one’s neighbor.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, Proverbs 28:27 says that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not the curses come from the poor who have been denied assistance, or from Yahweh himself, the point remains that <strong>there are rewards in caring for the impoverished and consequences for not doing so.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to generosity, however, the Hebrew sages also expressed concern for the <strong>justice</strong> of the poor.</p>
<p>Proverbs 29:7 makes it clear that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of justice for the poor is also stated later in the chapter in verse 14:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a king faithfully judges the poor, his throne will be established forever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given Yahweh’s “bias” toward the poor and their status as his image bearers, it would do one well to be concerned with their legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>It is not enough to simply not oppress the poor.</strong> Proverbs, along with the rest of Scripture, seems to mandate <strong>advocating for their justice.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In our current context of extravagant wealth and abject poverty existing side by side in a realm of confusion, apathy, and even malice towards the impoverished, Proverbs contains some timely and powerful teaching.</p>
<p>The Hebrew sages had a firm grasp on both the tempting causes and terrible effects of poverty. They, therefore, put a strong emphasis on <strong>avoiding it at all costs through diligence and hard work</strong>.</p>
<p>However, this did not lead them to <strong>abandon</strong> a proper view towards the poor, and they grounded all of their teachings about the proper treatment of the poor in <strong>the unchanging and perfect character of Yahweh, who is firmly committed to their protection and justice.</strong></p>
<p>The modern readers of this ancient book would do well to heed its teachings regarding poverty, and to proceed with attitudes and actions in imitation of Yahweh in their interactions with and opinions of the poor, destitute, and oppressed of this world.</p>
