      <title>O Come, O Come, Emmanuel: Extra Verses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&amp;rdquo; has long been one of my favorite hymns. This Advent, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write some additional verses. They emphasize God&amp;rsquo;s heart for the poor and the powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the Bible looking for these themes, they show up almost everywhere. However, in particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn from Leviticus 25, Psalm 113, Isaiah 58, Amos 5, Luke 1, and Luke 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O come, Defender of the weak,&lt;br&gt;
Teach us their welfare first to seek.&lt;br&gt;
May widow, orphan, refugee&lt;br&gt;
Find rest within Thy jubilee!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Find rest within Thy jubilee!</p>
<p>O come, Avenger of the poor,<br>
And open wide redemption&rsquo;s door.<br>
Undo the yoke, break every chain,<br>
And with Thee in Thy kingdom let them reign!</p>
<p>O come, Sustainer of the least,<br>
And lift them to Thy heavenly feast.<br>
Cast down the mighty from their seat,<br>
And fill the hungry with good things to eat!</p>
<p>O come, O Voice of Prophets bold,<br>
And bring the Day Thy saints foretold.<br>
Let justice roll like waters down,<br>
And righteousness for all abound!</p>

      <title>You Can&#39;t Follow Jesus and Hate Immigrants</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.</p>
<p>Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!</p>
<p>But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.</p>
<p>What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?</p>
<p>What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?</p>
<p>If you think that a given immigration policy or system is a mess and that X, Y, or Z should be done about it, what are your motivations? Are you concerned about the welfare of the immigrants themselves, many of whom are quite poor and powerless? Or are you acting out of fear and self-interest?</p>
<p>Some may object, saying that while Christians are called to love immigrants, we still need to protect our borders and uphold laws. And it’s true that immigration policy is complex, and nations have a responsibility to maintain order and security.</p>
<p>However, the question here isn’t about the specifics of policy but about the posture of our hearts. As followers of Jesus, our first responsibility is to love others—including immigrants—as those made in God’s image. Upholding laws and protecting our country should never justify fear, hatred, or dehumanization.</p>
<p>Others may argue that showing hospitality to immigrants and refugees could lead to an unsustainable burden on our resources or change our cultural identity. While practical concerns about resources are valid, Scripture repeatedly calls us to care for the vulnerable, trusting that God will provide.</p>
<p>Moreover, the kingdom of God is not confined by national or cultural boundaries! As citizens of this kingdom, our identity should first and foremost be shaped by our faith, not by our nationality.</p>
<p>The Bible actually has quite a bit to say about immigrants, sojourners, and refugees. In fact, you can even read the entire storyline of Scripture through these lenses. Here’s the tiniest of tastes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God.<br>
(Leviticus 19:33–34, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow.<br>
(Deuteronomy 27:19, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was a stranger and you invited me in…<br>
(Matthew 25:35, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.<br>
(Hebrews 13:14, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.<br>
(Hebrews 13:2, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As M. Daniel Carroll Rodas explains in <a href="/files/Carroll_Immigration_DictionaryOfScriptureAndEthics.pdf">a helpful article on “Aliens, Immigration, and Refugees”</a> (click that link for a PDF of the article):</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the Old and New Testaments offer rich teachings on migration, emphasizing that refugees and immigrants are made in the image of God.</li>
<li>Many biblical figures, like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus himself, were displaced persons.</li>
<li>Old Testament laws protected the vulnerable, including immigrants.</li>
<li>Jesus’s teachings further challenge believers to see the outsider as someone who can lead them to a deeper faith.</li>
<li>The New Testament epistles also call the church to care for those on the margins, reminding Christians that they, too, are “strangers” in the world.</li>
<li>Biblical teachings on migration should shape how Christians act toward immigrants today, promoting “human flourishing and the common good” through both personal behavior and societal involvement</li>
</ul>

Daniel Carroll R., “Aliens, Immigration, and Refugees,” <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Dictionary+of+Scripture+and+Ethics&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=joshuapsteele-20&amp;linkId=fe86bbace8a5c59f7354c6bde6fc84eb&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</a></em>, Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2011, 58).</p>
<p>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.</p>
<p>Next time you’re reading the Bible, keep an eye out for terms like “alien,” “stranger,” “resident alien,” “foreigner,” and “sojourner.”</p>
<p>The next time you think or speak about immigrants, ask yourself: Do your words reflect the heart of Jesus or the harsh rhetoric of political discourse?</p>
<p>Consider how the kingdom of God cuts right across ethnic and national boundaries, reshaping our loyalties to all nations, tribes, etc.</p>
<p>As followers of Jesus, we are called to reflect His love and compassion in every area of our lives, including how we treat immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p>Take time to examine your heart and attitudes, and ask how you can embody Christ’s radical hospitality.</p>
<p>Engage with Scripture, seek out opportunities to welcome the stranger, and challenge rhetoric that dehumanizes or divides.</p>
<p>Let’s commit to being voices of love, grace, and justice in a world that so desperately needs them.</p>

      <title>Christianity and Politics: My 2024 Reading List</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election. Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>When it comes to abortion, I think it’s a tragedy that needs to be reduced, ideally through a consistent pro-life ethic. However, I’m also curious about progressive theological arguments for a pro-choice stance. Here are a few books I’m reading to explore those ideas:</p>

      <title>25 Possibly Unpopular Opinions about Church</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/25-possibly-unpopular-opinions-about-church/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:42:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/25-possibly-unpopular-opinions-about-church/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following are some of my opinions, held with varying levels of intensity, about church/churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: These are geared toward Christian churches in the USA. Some would obviously also apply to churches elsewhere. But I haven’t nuanced this entire list for all global church contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many churches in the USA are too “busy.” They are trying to do too many different things and should instead refocus on the church’s proper priorities (Word and Sacraments).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following are some of my opinions, held with varying levels of intensity, about church/churches.</p>
<p>Note: These are geared toward Christian churches in the USA. Some would obviously also apply to churches elsewhere. But I haven’t nuanced this entire list for all global church contexts.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many churches in the USA are too “busy.” They are trying to do too many different things and should instead refocus on the church’s proper priorities (Word and Sacraments).</p>
<p>Churches should focus on preaching and teaching the Word of God, administering the Sacraments (Holy Communion and Baptism), and serving the welfare of their local communities.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you walk into a church sanctuary (or whatever else you want to call the place where the worship service takes place), the setting should (as much as possible) clearly indicate the importance of the Word of God and the Sacraments.</p>
<p>So, if possible, have a cross, pulpit, altar/table (for Holy Communion), etc. front-and-center.</p>
<p>Your country’s flag should not be in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Concerts and TED talks are both great. But a Christian worship service is not a concert with a TED talk thrown in.</p>
<p>Don’t try to mimic a concert. Don’t put the musicians front-and-center, if possible.</p>
<p>Use a mixture of sacred music (old and new) that is fitting for a Christian worship service. We don’t need covers of Coldplay, Taylor Swift, U2, etc. in a worship service.</p>
<p>The quality of the musicians and vocalists should be as good as possible, given the musical gifts that God has provided your congregation with. Doesn’t have to be world-class. Just don’t be distracting. Simple and good is better than showy or off-key.</p>
<p>Don’t have the same volume levels as a concert. The congregation should be able to hear itself sing (and think).</p>
<hr>
<p><em>At least</em> one passage of Scripture should be clearly read aloud during each worship service. Ideally more than one!</p>
<p>A sermon is for the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It’s not a standup comedy act, a motivational speech, TED talk, etc.</p>
<p>A sermon doesn’t need to be longer than 30 minutes.</p>
<hr>
<p>“We don’t do Holy Communion that often because we want it to be special” is a bad argument.</p>
<p>Churches should provide Holy Communion as often/regularly as logistically possible. Communion should be treated and taken with reverence, but it is not made special by our attitudes, feelings, etc. It is a work of God, by which He makes himself present to His people.</p>
<p>At minimum, the “Words of Institution” should be a part of every single Communion liturgy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. (1 Cor. 11:23-25)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holy Communion should be offered to all baptized followers of Jesus Christ. It should not be restricted to your denomination, congregation, branch of the church, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Positions (and titles) of pastoral leadership should be open to both men and women. As they are gifted, called, and trained to do so, women should be able to preach, teach, pastor, etc.–using the full breadth of their spiritual gifts.</p>
<hr>
<p>Each church should have clear policies around the prevention of and response to various forms of abuse. A child safety policy, abuse/harassment policy, etc. These policies should be regularly reviewed and enforced.</p>
<p>Accusations of abuse should be taken seriously, treated confidentially, and reported to the local authorities. Clergy should act as mandatory reporters, even if they are not required to do so by local law.</p>
<p>Church leaders who are caught up in abuse, scandal, etc. should be removed (or remove themselves) from office. Sure, there’s forgiveness for everyone at the Cross, but they need to find another line of work. “Abusive pastor” should be an oxymoron. No matter how charismatic or gifted they are, the church doesn’t “need” any one person to be in a position of power and authority, if they have shown they cannot be trusted with power and authority.</p>
<hr>
<p>Poor people should feel welcomed, loved, and respected at your church.</p>
<p>People from all countries, cultures, etc. should feel welcomed, loved, and respected at your church, regardless of their immigration status..</p>
<p>LGBTQ people should feel welcomed, loved, and respected at your church.</p>
<hr>
<p>If the church speaks out in the public square, it should be on behalf of “others,” instead of out of self-interest.</p>
<p>Less: “We’re being persecuted! We demand and defend our rights!”</p>
<p>More: “The poor and powerless are being persecuted! We demand and defend their rights, even if it costs us to do so!”</p>
<hr>
<p>To be continued…possibly.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-peter-417&#34;&gt;1 Peter 4:17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;isaiah-58114&#34;&gt;Isaiah 58:1–14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shout out, do not hold back!&lt;br&gt;
Lift up your voice like a trumpet!&lt;br&gt;
Announce to my people their rebellion,&lt;br&gt;
to the house of Jacob their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet day after day they seek me&lt;br&gt;
and delight to know my ways,&lt;br&gt;
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness&lt;br&gt;
and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;&lt;br&gt;
they ask of me righteous judgments,&lt;br&gt;
they delight to draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="1-peter-417">1 Peter 4:17</h2>
<p>For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</p>
<h2 id="isaiah-58114">Isaiah 58:1–14</h2>
<p>Shout out, do not hold back!<br>
Lift up your voice like a trumpet!<br>
Announce to my people their rebellion,<br>
to the house of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p>Yet day after day they seek me<br>
and delight to know my ways,<br>
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness<br>
and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;<br>
they ask of me righteous judgments,<br>
they delight to draw near to God.</p>
<p>“Why do we fast, but you do not see?<br>
Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?”</p>
<p>Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day,<br>
and oppress all your workers.</p>
<p>Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight<br>
and to strike with a wicked fist.</p>
<p>Such fasting as you do today<br>
will not make your voice heard on high.</p>
<p>Is such the fast that I choose,<br>
a day to humble oneself?</p>
<p>Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush,<br>
and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?</p>
<p>Will you call this a fast,<br>
a day acceptable to the LORD?</p>
<p>Is not this the fast that I choose:<br>
to loose the bonds of injustice,<br>
to undo the thongs of the yoke,<br>
to let the oppressed go free,<br>
and to break every yoke?</p>
<p>Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,<br>
and bring the homeless poor into your house;<br>
when you see the naked, to cover them,<br>
and not to hide yourself from your own kin?</p>
<p>Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,<br>
and your healing shall spring up quickly;<br>
your vindicator shall go before you,<br>
the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.</p>
<p>Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;<br>
you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.</p>
<p>If you remove the yoke from among you,<br>
the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,<br>
if you offer your food to the hungry<br>
and satisfy the needs of the afflicted,<br>
then your light shall rise in the darkness<br>
and your gloom be like the noonday.</p>
<p>The LORD will guide you continually,<br>
and satisfy your needs in parched places,<br>
and make your bones strong;<br>
and you shall be like a watered garden,<br>
like a spring of water,<br>
whose waters never fail.</p>
<p>Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;<br>
you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;<br>
you shall be called the repairer of the breach,<br>
the restorer of streets to live in.</p>
<p>If you refrain from trampling the sabbath,<br>
from pursuing your own interests on my holy day;<br>
if you call the sabbath a delight<br>
and the holy day of the LORD honorable;<br>
if you honor it, not going your own ways,<br>
serving your own interests, or pursuing your own affairs;<br>
then you shall take delight in the LORD,<br>
and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth;<br>
I will feed you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob,<br>
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p>
<h2 id="ezekiel-34116">Ezekiel 34:1–16</h2>
<p>The word of the LORD came to me:</p>
<p>Mortal, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy, and say to them—to the shepherds:</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>
<p>Ah, you shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?</p>
<p>You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep.</p>
<p>You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them.</p>
<p>So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.</p>
<p>My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with no one to search or seek for them.</p>
<p>Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild animals, since there was no shepherd; and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep;</p>
<p>therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord GOD, I am against the shepherds; and I will demand my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer shall the shepherds feed themselves.</p>
<p>I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, so that they may not be food for them.</p>
<p>For thus says the Lord GOD:</p>
<p>I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep.</p>
<p>I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.</p>
<p>I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land.</p>
<p>I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.</p>
<p>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak,</p>
<p>but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.</p>
