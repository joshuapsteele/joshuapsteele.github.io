      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until the past few days, our 4-year-old son, Andrew, has mainly prayed something like the following before dinner: &amp;ldquo;Dear Jesus, help us to have a good day tomorrow, and help this food to be good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the past few days, he has started to pray more spontaneously and creatively before dinner. Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Give us this day our holy bread&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Help us worship you even when we are in heaven&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>However, in the past few days, he has started to pray more spontaneously and creatively before dinner. Here are some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Help us worship you even when we are in heaven&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help us learn something new this day&hellip;the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us good feelings in life&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praise us our day&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help us to be well like you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help us to not fight anymore, and (looks at candles on the table) bless the candles&hellip; And light our holy day with the glory of you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for making all of these days and everything&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless our day&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please help us to learn lots about you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help us to live with your holy son, Jesus, and go with our presence (presents?)&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for making water, and the food that we need. Amen.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

      <title>Requiem for a Cousin on His Birthday</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/requiem-for-a-cousin-on-his-birthday/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2024 09:00:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/requiem-for-a-cousin-on-his-birthday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today should have been my cousin Eric&amp;rsquo;s 32nd birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, having lost him earlier this year to some serious health complications after a devastating motorcycle accident, we gathered to remember him and celebrate his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another member of our family gone too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two passages of Scripture came to mind as I thought about Eric today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this one from Ecclesiastes (which I &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/20150424my-uncle-timothy-steele/&#34;&gt;previously wrote a bit about after the untimely death of my Uncle Tim&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today should have been my cousin Eric&rsquo;s 32nd birthday.</p>
<p>Instead, having lost him earlier this year to some serious health complications after a devastating motorcycle accident, we gathered to remember him and celebrate his life.</p>
<p>Another member of our family gone too soon.</p>
<p>Two passages of Scripture came to mind as I thought about Eric today.</p>
<p>First, this one from Ecclesiastes (which I <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/20150424my-uncle-timothy-steele/">previously wrote a bit about after the untimely death of my Uncle Tim</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is better to go to the house of mourning<br>
than to go to the house of feasting,<br>
for this is the end of everyone,<br>
and the living will lay it to heart.<br>
Sorrow is better than laughter,<br>
for by sadness of countenance the heart is made glad.<br>
(Ecclesiastes 7:2-3)</p></blockquote>
<p>I turn 33 next month. Today was the first memorial service I&rsquo;ve attended for someone younger than me.</p>
<p>Life is short. None of us knows how much time we have left.</p>
<p>Now, there are many lessons to draw from this, but one of them is that we should speak well of people, we should &ldquo;eulogize&rdquo; them, before they die. If you&rsquo;ve got life-giving words for someone, even if they&rsquo;re hard words, don&rsquo;t wait! Don&rsquo;t wait until the funeral to say what should have been said before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful that I got the chance to visit Eric in the hospital before he died. And to tell him that I loved him, and that I was very grateful for his friendship when we were growing up.</p>
<p>Which brings to mind the second Scripture passage, this time from Proverbs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A friend loves at all times,<br>
and a brother is born for adversity.<br>
(Proverbs 17:17)</p></blockquote>
<p>As kids, Eric was a brother, a relative, who helped me through some tough times at what I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;the bottom of the cousin food chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dad was 9th of 10 kids. Eric&rsquo;s dad was 10th. So, by the time I came around and Eric joined me 11 months later, we were the two youngest boys in a large group of cousins.</p>
<p>Now, I mean no shade to my other older cousins. I think we&rsquo;ve all reconciled by now!</p>
<p>But, as an overweight little kid, I was often picked-on by my older cousins. And Eric, as a scrawny even littler kid, was right there with me.</p>
<p>I mean, we got ditched by the older cousins more times than I could count. And, even when we were allowed to play tag, hide-and-seek, etc., well, let&rsquo;s just say we were never coming out on top.</p>
<p>So we developed a special bond. The youngest cousins.</p>
<p>Sure, some of it was due to sheer necessity of birth order, but Eric was always a good friend to me.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t remember him ever making fun of me for my weight or anything else. Instead, he was always the one I looked for when we had a family gathering. The answer to the question &ldquo;is Eric going to be there?&rdquo; always set my expectations for how any given get-together was going to go.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we got on each other&rsquo;s nerves and had a few fights of our own.</p>
<p>But I mostly remember Eric&rsquo;s kindness.</p>
<p>He taught me how to cook ramen noodles on the stovetop. He taught me how to play Texas Hold &lsquo;Em. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he first taught me how BB and Airsoft guns worked, and we shot our fair share of targets (including, with the Airsoft guns, each other) in his backyard.</p>
<p>We rode bikes. Played catch. Did random wannabe outdoorsman stuff in the woods.</p>
<p>Eric was like the younger brother I never had.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad he&rsquo;s gone. And, even though I&rsquo;m glad I got to thank him for his friendship before he died, I wish I would have stayed in better touch with him as we grew older.</p>
<p>Death is terrible. Just really f***ing awful.</p>
<p>My consolation as I mourn yet another death is that I believe, in spite of all the suffering around me, that God hates Death even more than I do. I believe that Christ has defeated Death and that, one day, God&rsquo;s patient, suffering love will redeem all things.</p>
<p>Meditating on the untimely death of his son (also named Eric), and on the risen Christ&rsquo;s invitation to St. Thomas to put his hands into his wounds, Nicholas Wolterstorff writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To believe in Christ&rsquo;s rising from the grave is to accept it as a sign of our own rising from our graves. If for each of us it was our destiny to be obliterated, and for all of us together it was our destiny to fade away without a trace, then not Christ&rsquo;s rising but my dear son&rsquo;s early dying would be the logo of our fate.</p>
<p>[&hellip;] To believe in Christ&rsquo;s rising and death&rsquo;s dying is also to live with the power and the challenge to rise up now from all our dark graves of suffering love. If sympathy for the world&rsquo;s wounds is not enlarged by our anguish, if love for those around us is not expanded, if gratitude for what is good does not flame up, if insight is not deepened, if commitment to what is important is not strengthened, if aching for a new day is not intensified, if hope is weakened and faith diminished, if from the experience of death there comes nothing good, then death has won. Then death, be proud.</p>
<p>So I shall struggle to live the reality of Christ&rsquo;s dying and death&rsquo;s dying. In my living, my son&rsquo;s dying will not be the last word. But as I rise up, I bear the wounds of his death. My rising does not remove them. They mark me. If you want to know who I am, put your hand in.<br>
(Lament for a Son, 92).</p></blockquote>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s time of adversity has ended. For the rest of us, the adversities of life continue, including the mourning of those we&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>But life, laughter, joy, and friendship also endure. Death will not have the final word.</p>
<p>So, put your faith in the risen, wounded Christ. Join Him in the fight against Death.</p>
<p>And, if you&rsquo;re suffering, then, in memory of my cousin Eric, don&rsquo;t suffer alone.</p>
<p>Instead, look around and find someone else who needs a friend for tough times. A brother—a cousin, even!—born for adversity.</p>

      <title>10 Things I Love About My Kids</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 11:39:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lest &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/i-love-my-kids-but-i-sometimes-regret-having-them/&#34;&gt;my previous parenting post&lt;/a&gt; suggest that things are all doom-and-gloom at the Steele-haus, here are 10 things I love about my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got to baptize all 3 of them as babies, a poignant reminder that they are beloved children of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all love books, which warms my nerdy heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way Eleanor (1yo) greets me. It used to be a very excited squeal. Now it’s “Ah! Daddy!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew (4yo) has a great memory for stories, especially Bible stories. I was redoing our fire pit, and spraying it with a hose to cut down on dust as I re-leveled the ground. Andrew: “Elijah put water on the fire, too!” (see 1 Kings 18).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eva (6yo) is smart as a whip. She asks great questions, and I’m looking forward to (re-)learning with her as she gets older.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eleanor’s recently learned how to do an overly-exaggerated “angry eyebrows” face, and I find it absolutely hilarious. She now does it to get a laugh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew loves Spiderman, and he goes back-and-forth on whether or not he thinks superheroes are real. Listening to him as he narrates Spiderman scenarios while running around in his Spiderman costume is always entertaining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eva will sometimes read books to Andrew and Eleanor. They will then imitate her–Andrew, by reciting stories from memory as he turns through the books, and Eleanor, by babbling to herself as she flips the pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can get them all to watch things with me like This Old House, DIY videos, tool reviews, etc. Partially because they’re all curious and enjoy learning about tools. Partially (OK, mostly) because they’re thankful they’re watching *something* on the TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’re all still young enough that they frequently want hugs and snuggles.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>I Love My Kids, But I Sometimes Regret Having Them</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/i-love-my-kids-but-i-sometimes-regret-having-them/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 08:51:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love my kids, but I sometimes regret having them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pardon the clickbait-y title and opening sentence. But are we parents allowed to say that? Are we allowed to feel both of those things at once?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a 6-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an almost-2-year-old. And, no, I don’t actually begrudge them their existence! I want what’s best for their lives and futures. And don’t get me wrong; &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/&#34;&gt;there are moments of laughter, poignancy, joy, etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love my kids, but I sometimes regret having them.</p>
<p>Pardon the clickbait-y title and opening sentence. But are we parents allowed to say that? Are we allowed to feel both of those things at once?</p>
<p>We’ve got a 6-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an almost-2-year-old. And, no, I don’t actually begrudge them their existence! I want what’s best for their lives and futures. And don’t get me wrong; <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/">there are moments of laughter, poignancy, joy, etc.</a></p>
<p>But they’re also driving me crazy.</p>
<p>The noise, chaos, and overstimulation have me frequently annoyed at my kids before they’ve even finished breakfast. I usually just stare into the middle distance during mealtimes. By the time they’ve all gone (back) to bed (for the final time), I just want to crawl into a dark, quiet hole.</p>
<p>If my wife weren’t such a rockstar, our family’s daily life would probably have fallen apart by now. But it’s wearing her down, too.</p>
<p>We’ve tried gentle parenting and not-so-gentle parenting. We <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=parenting+books&amp;crid=3QVJIF4D7G2D7&amp;sprefix=parenting%2Caps%2C183&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=joshuapsteele-20&amp;linkId=e2dc22d364345a0d1e9b31822e628163&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">read all the parenting books</a>. We try to learn, good and bad, from our own parents. We try to learn from other parents our age.</p>
<p>We’ve prayed for patience and wisdom, for ourselves and for our children. Like this prayer “For the Care of Children” from the <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZC2wSz">1979 Book of Common Prayer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almighty God, heavenly Father, you have blessed us with the joy and care of children: Give us calm strength and patient wisdom as we bring them up, that we may teach them to love whatever is just and true and good, following the example of our Savior Jesus Christ. <em>Amen.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve tried to teach our kids how to deal with their big feelings in a healthy way. We’ve reminded them that, while they’re free to feel their feelings, they still need to make good choices about what they do with those feelings, because choices have consequences.</p>
<p>I know I’m not alone in this. I also know that all of this says more about me than it does about my kids. (“It’s me. Hi! I’m the problem. It’s me.”)</p>
<p>Other parents out there have more children, with worse behavior and fewer resources. Others out there desperately wish they had children, and are probably pretty upset with me right now, if they read this.</p>
<p>And yet, here we are. Are other parents as stressed-out as I am?</p>
<p>When I read the Surgeon General’s <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/parents/index.html">“Parents Under Pressure” Advisory</a>, that “parents are at their wits’ end” and there’s an “urgent need to better support parents, caregivers, and families,” I nod in exhausted agreement.</p>
<p>And I say a weary “amen” when I read this insightful opinion piece on how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/opinion/parenting-helicopter-ignoring.html">“Parents Should Ignore Their Children More Often.”</a> In it, Darby Saxbe suggests that “one of the best things parents can do — for ourselves as well as for our children — is to go about our own lives and tote our children along. You might call it mindful underparenting.” Saxbe isn’t suggesting parental neglect, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To be sure, when kids are upset, in danger or require guidance, parents can and should swoop in to help. But that is precisely the point: It is only by ignoring our children much of the time that we conserve the energy necessary to give them our full attention when they actually need it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Brilliant. Right? But it’s not like we’re actively trying to be helicopter parents.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where I’m going with this, but it’s left me wondering what kind of societal, structural, and personal changes are required to help us parents endure and raise wise humans. You know, without collapsing into abandonment, abuse, alcoholism, or any of the other unhealthy ways of coping with parenting stress.</p>
<p>I’ll close with another quote from Saxbe’s opinion piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In other words, underparenting requires structural change, and not just the obvious changes that we think of as parental stress-relievers, such as family leave and paid child care. It also requires that as a society, we build back our tolerance for children in public spaces, as annoying and distracting as they can be, and create safe environments where lightly supervised kids can roam freely. In a society that treated children as a public good, we would keep a collective eye on all our kids — which would free us of the need to hover over our own.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed. So let’s give all our kids, and the stressed-out parents we know and love, a big hug today. And think about how we can help raise the next generations — with minimal regrets.</p>
<p>(P.S. It’s not all doom-and-gloom at the Steele-haus. Here are <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/">10 things I love about my kids</a>.)</p>

      <title>Finding a Hat for My Big, Bald Head</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/finding-a-hat-for-my-big-bald-head/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 12:48:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/finding-a-hat-for-my-big-bald-head/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on a lifelong journey to find hats that will fit my big ol’ head. Now that I’m bald, and the summer months are approaching, I figured it would be good to find one or two more hats to add to my rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve narrowed this round down to trying the following hats, in case you’re interested (Amazon affiliate links below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOO SMALL FOR ME&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3xVZv3O&#34;&gt;Carhartt Men’s Rugged Professional Series Canvas Mesh-Back Cap&lt;/a&gt; (Shadow, One Size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3Wi6GgS&#34;&gt;Carhartt Men’s 100289 Odessa Ball Cap&lt;/a&gt; (Carhartt Brown, One Size)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m a sucker for Carhartt and Carhartt brown!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This hat is comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like that it looks different than my other hats, which tend to be black, gray, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3UzLvWa&#34;&gt;Ankor Ultra Performance Water-Resistant UPF 50 Baseball Hat&lt;/a&gt; (Charcoal Gray, One Size)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charcoal gray is my favorite color (not sure what that says about me…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really like the look and fit of this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3xLtY4j&#34;&gt;Flexfit Men’s Delta Seamless Cap&lt;/a&gt; (Dark Grey, XX-Large)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love the look and color of this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very comfortable!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder if it’s a tad *too* big for my head, though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/4aI6v2F&#34;&gt;Flexfit Mens Cool &amp;amp; Dry Sport&lt;/a&gt; (Grey, X-Large-XX-Large)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This hat gets here in the mail today! I’m excited to try it out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve often enjoyed lifting weights, but I’ve never enjoyed going to the gym. So, I’ve long wanted a nice home gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we lived in a basement apartment, space was very limited, but I was able to fit a &lt;a href=&#34;https://valorfitness.com/products/bd-9-independent-power-squat-stands&#34;&gt;Valor Fitness BD-9 squat rack/stands&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3Tawich&#34;&gt;Amazon Basics flat bench&lt;/a&gt; in, along with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p/fitness-gear-300-lbolympic-weight-set-16fgeu300lbstwth7brb/16fgeu300lbstwth7brb&#34;&gt;300-lb Olympic barbell and weight set&lt;/a&gt; from Dicks Sporting Goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you’re similarly pressed for space, I highly recommend those items above!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve often enjoyed lifting weights, but I’ve never enjoyed going to the gym. So, I’ve long wanted a nice home gym.</p>
<p>When we lived in a basement apartment, space was very limited, but I was able to fit a <a href="https://valorfitness.com/products/bd-9-independent-power-squat-stands">Valor Fitness BD-9 squat rack/stands</a> and an <a href="https://amzn.to/3Tawich">Amazon Basics flat bench</a> in, along with a <a href="https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p/fitness-gear-300-lbolympic-weight-set-16fgeu300lbstwth7brb/16fgeu300lbstwth7brb">300-lb Olympic barbell and weight set</a> from Dicks Sporting Goods.</p>
<p>(If you’re similarly pressed for space, I highly recommend those items above!)</p>
<p>We took all this stuff with us when we moved to renting a 100-year old house in Pittsburgh. There was enough space in the basement, but we referred to it as the “murder basement” because it way so creepy, damp, moldy, and dark down there.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, when we’ve finally got a garage!</p>
<p>My wife’s an avid runner, so we splurged for a nice <a href="https://www.soletreadmills.com/products/sole-f85">Sole F-85 treadmill</a>.</p>
<p>And I pulled the trigger on a power rack: <a href="https://repfitness.com/products/pr-1100-power-rack">Rep Fitness’s PR-1100</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/88604851-219F-4B94-9407-A6F57BA76469_1_105_c-225x300.jpeg" alt="Valor Fitness BD-9 Squat Stands"  />

</p>
<p>Next on my list, as a part of <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/back-in-the-saddle/">getting back into the saddle</a>, as it were, is USING this equipment more regularly, as a part of getting back into shape.</p>
<p>Future upgrades to the home gym include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting together a deadlifting platform/surface (probably with these <a href="https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/4-ft-x-6-ft-x-3-4-in-thick-rubber-stall-mat">horse stall mats from Tractor Supply Co.</a>)</li>
<li>Getting a nicer barbell (I’ve got my eyes on <a href="https://repfitness.com/products/colorado-bar-20kg">Rep Fitness’s Colorado bar</a>)</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I’m not alone in this, but the past few years have been pretty rough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve gained at least 50 pounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a fun part-time gig as a managing editor come to an end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve come to terms with some &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/its-time-to-get-some-help/&#34;&gt;long-term depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a job offer ripped out from under me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/its-official-im-hitting-pause-on-my-ph-d-for-a-year/&#34;&gt;hit pause&lt;/a&gt; on and eventually dropped out of my Ph.D. program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/&#34;&gt;resigned from ordained ministry in the ACNA&lt;/a&gt;, my previous denomination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.</p>
<p>But, overall, I definitely feel less focused and energized than I used to.</p>
<p>Do I have a sure solution or a grand commitment to make? No.</p>
<p>But I decided that I can at least start blogging about turning things around. I can write about my experiences as I try to get back into the personal development saddle.</p>
<p>As a first step, I need to get a better grip of everything I’ve got “in flight” at the moment. I’ve got far too many things bouncing around in my head, and I need to get them down on paper and/or a digital system to manage them.</p>
<p>So I’ve dusted-off my copy of <a href="https://amzn.to/3wJO5iZ"><em>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</em> by David Allen</a>. And I’ve started a “brain dump” in my main notebook (a Bullet Journal-like combination of journaling, to-dos, and notes).</p>
<p>Any other crestfallen personal development/productivity junkies out there? Let me know how it’s going!</p>

      <title>I&#39;m Resigning from Ordained Ministry in the Anglican Church in North America</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 19:50:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a considerable period of discernment, coupled with my growing disaffection with the Anglican Church in North America, I sense God calling me to step away from ordained ministry in the ACNA and instead to focus on my family and my career as a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also coincides with plans to move closer to family in NW Ohio (where there is not much of an ACNA presence to speak of) and to then pursue church involvement outside of the ACNA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a considerable period of discernment, coupled with my growing disaffection with the Anglican Church in North America, I sense God calling me to step away from ordained ministry in the ACNA and instead to focus on my family and my career as a software engineer.</p>
<p>This also coincides with plans to move closer to family in NW Ohio (where there is not much of an ACNA presence to speak of) and to then pursue church involvement outside of the ACNA.</p>
<p>Therefore, in accordance with Title III, Canon 6, Section 4 of the ACNA Canons (“Concerning Voluntary Resignation from the Ordained Ministry of this Church”), I have tendered my voluntary resignation from the ordained ministry of the Anglican Church in North America, effective on 2023-11-01.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">
  <img src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Joshua-Steele-ACNA-Resignation_2023-11-07.jpg" alt="A letter from Todd Hunter, Bishop Ordinary of The Diocese of Churches for the Sake of Others, approving Joshua Steele's request to resign from ministerial duties in the ACNA.">
  <figcaption>A letter from Todd Hunter, Bishop Ordinary of The Diocese of Churches for the Sake of Others, approving Joshua Steele's request to resign from ministerial duties in the ACNA.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As of 2023-11-07, my bishop and diocese have confirmed that I am a Presbyter in good standing, not under discipline as defined in Title IV of the ACNA Canons, and that my resignation is not occasioned by misconduct or irregularity, but is voluntary and for causes which do not affect my moral character.</p>
<p>My resignation has therefore been accepted. This means that I am released from the obligations of the Ministerial office. I relinquish the right to exercise the gifts and spiritual authority as a Minister of God’s Word and Sacraments in the Anglican Church in North America.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’d like to clarify that the ACNA Canons differentiate between (A) resigning from the ordained ministry of the ACNA and (B) renouncing one’s Holy Orders as such.</p>
<p>While I currently have no plans to pursue ordained ministry within another Christian denomination or jurisdiction, I am solely (A) resigning from the ordained ministry in the ACNA, not (B) renouncing my Holy Orders. This distinction leaves the door ajar for potential ordained ministry elsewhere, should the Lord call me back to such in the future.</p>

      <title>Life Lessons: 32 Things I&#39;ve Learned So Far</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/life-lessons/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 12:45:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/life-lessons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are 32 things I’ve learned from life, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not your thoughts. There is a “you” behind and above your inner voice/monologue/dialogue. Pay attention to what you pay attention to. Think about what you think about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We always only have the present moment. Focusing too much on the future leads to anxiety. Focusing too much on the past leads to depression. Wherever you are, be fully there, now! (Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/400hFeH&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt; by Eckhart Tolle&lt;/a&gt; [affiliate link here and throughout] for more on this.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s OK not to be OK. Feeling anxious, depressed, angry, etc. is fine. However, avoid the trap of feeling anxious about how anxious you feel, feeling depressed about how depressed you feel, etc. (Learned this from &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/404talb&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Happiness Trap&lt;/em&gt; by Russ Harris&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you never make mistakes, you’re not learning/growing as well as you could be. Perfectionism is a deadly prison. Break free with “good enough” and “always learning.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are stronger than you think you are. You are weaker than you think you are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask more questions. Ask better questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is not a thing among things. There is an “infinite qualitative difference” between God and everything that is not God, everything that exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus of Nazareth is the living Lord of all. ___ is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of overconfidence in what the Bible (or any other sacred text, for that matter) “clearly”does or does not say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is devoted to the poor and powerless. Those who speak and act on God’s behalf should speak and act &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the poor and powerless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do better with people, ask them questions about themselves. (Read the classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3QlSsrR&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/em&gt; by Dale Carnegie&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t out-exercise your appetite forever. &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/4018XfY&#34;&gt;Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get enough sleep. You probably don’t get enough sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift heavy things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go outside. Take a walk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a Roth IRA. Invest consistently in low-cost mutual funds or lifecycle funds as soon as you can. (Learned this from &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/48Uc65D&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Will Teach You to Be Rich&lt;/em&gt; by Ramit Sethi&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading is a superpower. You can learn from as many other lives and lifetimes as you want. &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/46YrOdW&#34;&gt;Learn how to read&lt;/a&gt;. Then &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/46Dgm7J&#34;&gt;learn how to learn.&lt;/a&gt; Then, learn whatever you want!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always read with a pen or pencil in your hand. If you really want to learn from a book, buy a physical copy and annotate the heck out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You always have to earn and keep your audience’s attention. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “Why should they care? What’s in it for them?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans are incredibly good at misunderstanding each other. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “How might I be misunderstood? How might I be misunderstanding others?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that you and your loved ones are all going to die. What do you want to be known for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eulogize people BEFORE they die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone should go to therapy for at least a few months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.” Feeling nervous/stressed/angry/etc.? SLOW DOWN, especially if you’re in front of other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Courage is a choice, not a feeling. No matter how nervous you are, you can always ACT courageously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is trying to figure it out as they go along. Do you often feel like an imposter? Join the club!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act like you’ve been here before. Act like you’ve done this before. Act calm, comfortable, and confident, if for no other reason than to help the people around you feel calm, comfortable, and confident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership is service. Leadership is the willingness to make a decision for the good of the group even when it’s awkward or uncomfortable to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on what you can control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journal. What do you really want? What are you afraid of? What’s the most important thing you need to get done today? Get a notebook and write it down!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many domains, 80% of the outcomes/effects come from 20% of the inputs/causes. Find the “vital few” things that have outsized impacts, both positive and negative, on your life. Double-down on what’s helping you. Get rid of what’s hurting you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use smoked paprika. You’re welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are 32 things I’ve learned from life, so far.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are not your thoughts. There is a “you” behind and above your inner voice/monologue/dialogue. Pay attention to what you pay attention to. Think about what you think about.</li>
<li>We always only have the present moment. Focusing too much on the future leads to anxiety. Focusing too much on the past leads to depression. Wherever you are, be fully there, now! (Read <a href="https://amzn.to/400hFeH"><em>The Power of Now</em> by Eckhart Tolle</a> [affiliate link here and throughout] for more on this.)</li>
<li>It’s OK not to be OK. Feeling anxious, depressed, angry, etc. is fine. However, avoid the trap of feeling anxious about how anxious you feel, feeling depressed about how depressed you feel, etc. (Learned this from <a href="https://amzn.to/404talb"><em>The Happiness Trap</em> by Russ Harris</a>.)</li>
<li>If you never make mistakes, you’re not learning/growing as well as you could be. Perfectionism is a deadly prison. Break free with “good enough” and “always learning.”</li>
<li>You are stronger than you think you are. You are weaker than you think you are.</li>
<li>Ask more questions. Ask better questions.</li>
<li>God is not a thing among things. There is an “infinite qualitative difference” between God and everything that is not God, everything that exists.</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth is the living Lord of all. ___ is not.</li>
<li>Beware of overconfidence in what the Bible (or any other sacred text, for that matter) “clearly”does or does not say.</li>
<li>God is devoted to the poor and powerless. Those who speak and act on God’s behalf should speak and act <em>for</em> the poor and powerless.</li>
<li>To do better with people, ask them questions about themselves. (Read the classic <a href="https://amzn.to/3QlSsrR"><em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> by Dale Carnegie</a>.)</li>
<li>You can’t out-exercise your appetite forever. <a href="https://amzn.to/4018XfY">Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.</a></li>
<li>Get enough sleep. You probably don’t get enough sleep.</li>
<li>Lift heavy things.</li>
<li>Go outside. Take a walk.</li>
<li>Open a Roth IRA. Invest consistently in low-cost mutual funds or lifecycle funds as soon as you can. (Learned this from <a href="https://amzn.to/48Uc65D"><em>I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em> by Ramit Sethi</a>.)</li>
<li>Reading is a superpower. You can learn from as many other lives and lifetimes as you want. <a href="https://amzn.to/46YrOdW">Learn how to read</a>. Then <a href="https://amzn.to/46Dgm7J">learn how to learn.</a> Then, learn whatever you want!</li>
<li>Always read with a pen or pencil in your hand. If you really want to learn from a book, buy a physical copy and annotate the heck out of it.</li>
<li>You always have to earn and keep your audience’s attention. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “Why should they care? What’s in it for them?”</li>
<li>Humans are incredibly good at misunderstanding each other. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “How might I be misunderstood? How might I be misunderstanding others?”</li>
<li>Remember that you and your loved ones are all going to die. What do you want to be known for?</li>
<li>Eulogize people BEFORE they die.</li>
<li>Everyone should go to therapy for at least a few months.</li>
<li>“Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.” Feeling nervous/stressed/angry/etc.? SLOW DOWN, especially if you’re in front of other people.</li>
<li>Courage is a choice, not a feeling. No matter how nervous you are, you can always ACT courageously.</li>
<li>Everyone is trying to figure it out as they go along. Do you often feel like an imposter? Join the club!</li>
<li>Act like you’ve been here before. Act like you’ve done this before. Act calm, comfortable, and confident, if for no other reason than to help the people around you feel calm, comfortable, and confident.</li>
<li>Leadership is service. Leadership is the willingness to make a decision for the good of the group even when it’s awkward or uncomfortable to do so.</li>
<li>Focus on what you can control.</li>
<li>Journal. What do you really want? What are you afraid of? What’s the most important thing you need to get done today? Get a notebook and write it down!</li>
<li>In many domains, 80% of the outcomes/effects come from 20% of the inputs/causes. Find the “vital few” things that have outsized impacts, both positive and negative, on your life. Double-down on what’s helping you. Get rid of what’s hurting you.</li>

      <title>My Coding Bootcamp Journey: How a Pastor Became a Programmer</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/my-coding-bootcamp-journey-how-a-pastor-became-a-programmer/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 17:42:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/my-coding-bootcamp-journey-how-a-pastor-became-a-programmer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Bible shortly before my first semester of college, I realized that what I was studying was not going to make me rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, throughout undergrad, seminary, and into a Ph.D. program in theology, the notion of “bi-vocational ministry” (serving the church while also making money outside of the church doing something else) was on my radar screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for a few months between finishing seminary and starting my Ph.D. program, I tried to teach myself the basics of web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Ruby on Rails. (I signed up for an account on &lt;a href=&#34;https://teamtreehouse.com/&#34;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&#34;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; and I got to work!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Bible shortly before my first semester of college, I realized that what I was studying was not going to make me rich.</p>
<p>So, throughout undergrad, seminary, and into a Ph.D. program in theology, the notion of “bi-vocational ministry” (serving the church while also making money outside of the church doing something else) was on my radar screen.</p>
<p>In fact, for a few months between finishing seminary and starting my Ph.D. program, I tried to teach myself the basics of web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Ruby on Rails. (I signed up for an account on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> and on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> and I got to work!)</p>
<p>However, once I got accepted into a Ph.D. program (and realized that I needed to learn how to read in German ASAP in order to pass a translation exam), my programming learning fell by the wayside.</p>
<p>While a full-time Ph.D. student, I got some basic web design experience as the Managing Editor of a website. Most of my time was spent using WordPress, but I knew just enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous (i.e., to fix small problems).</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">the Ph.D.</a> did not go as planned. (More on that some other time.) Neither did that part-time website job. So, after months of searching unsuccessfully for church (or church-adjacent) work, I resurrected the idea of teaching myself how to code. I dove back into freeCodeCamp’s curriculum and started chipping away.</p>
<p>But it was slow going. Getting a tech job seemed like an impossible dream. And, although there’s a TON of information online, I desperately craved having teachers and fellow students I could talk to. (I’m a big fan of asking questions. All the time.) I wanted some personal help in order to put things into context, to see the big picture and the path forward to a job.</p>
<p>When I first started learning how to code again, there were always enough church-related job opportunities to keep me distracted from coding. After all, I had studied the Bible and theology for over a decade. My training was church-focused (<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/portfolio/cv/">just look at my C.V.</a>). So, if there were a church-focused job out there for me, obviously I should focus on finding it. Right?</p>
<p>After a particularly devastating disappointment (I was offered a church-adjacent marketing position that was then rescinded within 48 hours), I decided to go all-in on a coding bootcamp.</p>
<p>I’ll say more about my bootcamp selection process in another post. But I had my eyes on <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a> because (1) they published their job placement numbers (to <a href="https://cirr.org/">CIRR</a>), (2) they had a campus in Pittsburgh (where we were moving), and (3) their <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/coding-bootcamp/full-time-coding-bootcamp/">curriculum</a> contained not just coding information, but also a job-search component.</p>
<p>So, we spent just over $15,000 on the 14-week bootcamp in the Fall of 2021.</p>
<p>It was one of the most intense learning periods in my entire life! But I loved having teachers and fellow students that I could ask questions to. And I thoroughly benefited from the career coaching components of the bootcamp.</p>
<p>Tech Elevator not only taught me the (1) fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java and (2) the basics of responsive web design. It also helped me revise and re-frame my experience to help me find a tech job. I rewrote my resume. I developed an “elevator pitch.” I prepared for common interview questions, both at the HR and the technical level (the dreaded whiteboarding experience!).</p>
<p>Tech Elevator hooked us students up with a handful of initial “matchmaking interviews,” one of which led me to my current position! This was a HUGE help because, without a computer science degree or industry experience, it can be a pain to get past the initial application phase.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve worked as a software engineer for a year, I can say that doing a coding bootcamp was one of the best investments I’ve ever made.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, it’s not for everyone. I would only recommend a bootcamp if you are a highly motivated learner. There’s a lot of information to find and digest, and you need to have a real hunger for learning (and a willingness to make mistakes and be wrong as you figure things out).</p>
<p>If you’re considering doing a bootcamp, <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/coding-aptitude-test/">take Tech Elevator’s Coding Aptitude Test for free</a>! And dive into free “learn to code” resources online (like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> or <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>) to see if you like the kind of thinking that’s required to do software development!</p>
<p>That’s all for now, but I plan to keep blogging about my journey into tech. So, if you’ve got any questions you’d like me to answer, please let me know in a comment below! (Or use <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/contact/">the contact form</a> to email me.)</p>

<p>UPDATE: On 2023-02-16, I was promoted to Software Engineer II! If you’d like to connect professionally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuapsteele/">come find me @joshuapsteele on LinkedIn</a>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m working my way through the classic job search guide <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3O8cnYK">What Color Is Your Parachute</a></em>. First, I’ll summarize the 7-part “Flower Petal” exercise—a comprehensive self-assessment geared toward the workplace. Then, I’ll share *my* results from the self-assessment.</p>
<p>Ah, but first, my <strong>TL;DR</strong>: <strong>If you’re looking for work, or going to be looking for work soon, do yourself a huge favor and buy the latest edition of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3O8cnYK">What Color Is Your Parachute</a></em>.</strong> Work through the book, especially the Flower Petal Exercise. It’s well-worth your time!</p>
<h2 id="the-flower-petal-exercise">The Flower Petal Exercise</h2>
<p>The Flower Petal Exercise is a self-discovery tool designed to help individuals identify their career objectives and life goals. Using a visual analogy of a flower, it engages users in an interactive exploration of their skills, interests, values, and professional aspirations.</p>
<p>The ‘flower’ consists of seven ‘petals’ or components, each representing a different aspect of a person’s work-life:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>People Environments</strong>: Here, you define the type of people you enjoy working with. Consider factors such as company culture, team size, or the sociopolitical views of your colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Working Conditions</strong>: This focuses on the conditions under which you perform best. It may include factors like flexible working hours, remote work, office settings, or your preference for a structured versus unstructured work environment.</li>
<li><strong>Transferable Skills</strong>: These are skills you’ve acquired over time that can be transferred across various roles and industries. For instance, project management, problem-solving, or leadership skills.</li>
<li><strong>Fields of Knowledge</strong>: This petal captures specific knowledge areas you’re interested in or have a deep understanding of. This could be anything from technology to psychology or even history.</li>
<li><strong>Level of Responsibility</strong>: This petal evaluates your desire for responsibility. Are you seeking a leadership role, or do you prefer a supportive, team member role?</li>
<li><strong>Salary and Level of Lifestyle</strong>: Here you outline your financial goals and the lifestyle you aim for. It includes considerations like desired salary, job benefits, and work-life balance.</li>
<li><strong>Values and Goals</strong>: This final petal is about your personal values and life goals, aligning your career with your moral compass and long-term aspirations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each petal is equally important, and the final image should give you a holistic view of your career preferences and strengths. The objective of the Flower Petal Exercise is to help you understand yourself better, providing a clear vision of your career path and enabling you to make more informed decisions in your professional life.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the exercise is not a one-time thing. Your ‘flower’ is expected to change and evolve as you grow, learn, and experience more in your life and career.</p>

      <title>It&#39;s Official. I&#39;m Hitting Pause on My Ph.D. for a Year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received word yesterday that the Ph.D. Committee voted to approve my request for “Excused Program Leave” beginning in January 2021 and lasting until January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of sounding like Captain Obvious, 2020 has been a particularly difficult year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempting to complete my “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” dissertation has taken a toll on my mental health as I ran into some major research and writing roadblocks right before and during the COVID pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received word yesterday that the Ph.D. Committee voted to approve my request for “Excused Program Leave” beginning in January 2021 and lasting until January 2022.</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding like Captain Obvious, 2020 has been a particularly difficult year.</p>
<p>Attempting to complete my “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” dissertation has taken a toll on my mental health as I ran into some major research and writing roadblocks right before and during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>Through therapy, medication, my amazing wife, and other means, the Lord has proven faithful to provide for me and my (growing) family during these difficult days.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after a lot of prayer and counsel, I’ve decided that stepping away from my dissertation for a year is the wise call right now. It’s the best chance I have to either (1) return and finish my dissertation while retaining my health or (2) discern that getting my Ph.D., at least at this point in my life, is not what the Lord is calling me to do.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, whether I’m “Rev. Dr.” or just “Rev.,” I want to put my time and talents to good use for the sake of Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>To that end, I would appreciate your prayers for the year ahead as I attempt to prioritize healing and ministry. I’m preaching again this weekend as Advent begins, and it’s a good reminder that (1) I love the Church and (2) I need to learn how to “wait for the Lord.”</p>

      <title>Josh&#43;? On the use of the sign of the cross (plus sign) in clergy signatures</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/josh-on-the-use-of-the-sign-of-the-cross-plus-sign-in-clergy-signatures/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 13:57:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/josh-on-the-use-of-the-sign-of-the-cross-plus-sign-in-clergy-signatures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures—unless it’s done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient—is pretentious. It’s showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I’m not making a claim about the *people* who use crosses in their signatures, their inner thoughts, or their intentions. For all I know, every single clergyperson out there says a prayer of blessing for their recipients every single time they use the sign of the cross in a signature. I’m also not writing this about any person in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures—unless it’s done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient—is pretentious. It’s showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.</p>

For all I know, every single clergyperson out there says a prayer of blessing for their recipients every single time they use the sign of the cross in a signature. I’m also not writing this about any person in particular.</p>
<p>I’m merely observing what I take to be the *connotation* of a particular speech act.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to use a signature with the sign of the cross in, say, a letter to a parishioner that you end with “May the Lord bless you and keep you.” In that case, it’s more obviously functioning like a written replacement for the sign of the cross that one would make with one’s hand if one were giving a priestly blessing in person.</p>
<p>However, apart from the immediate context of a blessing or prayer, I dare say that <a href="https://qr.ae/pNA4ts">most people just think it’s a plus sign</a>. Perhaps a typo when one meant to hit backspace? A new subscription service for personal communication? Or maybe the new-and-improved version of so-and-so now that they’ve turned a corner in their life and things are looking up?</p>
<p>I’m not saying that we clerics need to stop using the sign of the cross in our signatures altogether! A poor connotation for something (say, wearing a clergy shirt in public) doesn’t mean we should abandon it. I’m just suggesting that we should be more judicious in its use.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I’ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and &lt;em&gt;trapped&lt;/em&gt; often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I’ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.</p>
<p>Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and <em>trapped</em> often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.</p>
<p>I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!</p>
<p>However, as I see it, I’m writing it out here for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To commit publicly to seeking out counseling</strong> now that I’ve started my first try of medication.</li>
<li><strong>In case anyone else out there</strong>, currently experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, etc., <strong>needs a nudge to seek out help sooner rather than later</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If #2 above refers to you, please know that you’re not alone! Please don’t let pride or anything else get in the way of receiving the help that you need.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I needed this prayer this morning, and I plan to return to it often in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most loving Father, you will us to give thanks for all things, to dread nothing but the loss of you, and to cast all our care on the One who cares for us. Preserve us from faithless fears and worldly anxieties, and grant that no clouds of this mortal life may hide from us the light of that love which is immortal, and which you have manifested unto us in your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Ph.D. Plan (Or the Lack Thereof)</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-phd-plan-or-the-lack-thereof/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For months and months now, I’ve been praying for either (1) a breakthrough on my “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” dissertation or (2) a clear sign that I should quit the Ph.D. Unfortunately, after countless confusing dead ends in my endeavors to put Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer into precise conversation with each other regarding specific passages of the Bible, I’ve now realized that such an approach is not going to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For months and months now, I’ve been praying for either (1) a breakthrough on my “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” dissertation or (2) a clear sign that I should quit the Ph.D. Unfortunately, after countless confusing dead ends in my endeavors to put Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer into precise conversation with each other regarding specific passages of the Bible, I’ve now realized that such an approach is not going to work.</p>
<p>Perhaps I’ve missed something. Perhaps there’s a passage of Scripture out there that both Barth and Bonhoeffer wrote about that contains a theologically significant exegetical disagreement worth writing home about.</p>
<p>More likely: Barth and Bonhoeffer handled the Bible in different enough ways that comparing them as if they were two modern Bible commentators is a fool’s errand. Sure, it would have been great if, for example, they had a lengthy exegetical disagreement on whether or not Romans 7 describes the current Christian life. But I’ve been searching and searching for things like that, and I simply haven’t found them. Instead, I’ve found a cryptic student note here, a missing sermon manuscript there. This approach is simply not the dissertation that the subject matter requires. And it certainly hasn’t yielded anything <em>constructive</em> enough to meet Wheaton’s Ph.D. requirements!</p>
<p>This is the closest thing I’ve had to a breakthrough since starting the project. And, given that focusing on specific passages of Scripture was going to be the main thing that distinguished my project from other Barth and Bonhoeffer studies, this is a pretty crushing realization.</p>
<p>What’s more, I’ve essentially given up on using the “theological critique of religion” as a theological lens/scaffold, because getting clear on what Barth and Bonhoeffer meant by “religion” (an important step in understanding their relationship, I believe) was <em>not</em> helping me zero-in on particular biblical material. “Religion” is a slippery term in general, and it has many thematic tentacles, as it were, in Barth and Bonhoeffer’s writings. Construed a certain way, anything and everything that they said could be about “religion.”</p>
<p>So, where does that leave me?</p>
<p>Well, I’m convinced that <em>something</em> needs to change. I’m not prepared to continue sacrificing my mental, emotional, physical, and relational health on the altar of this Ph.D. Unfortunately, this isn’t exactly the clear sign that I should <em>quit</em> that I was hoping for. There are still other dissertation options within the realm of “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible.” They each have their downsides, and I’m not getting my hopes up, but they’re intriguing enough that I feel like I need to at least explore them before I call it quits.</p>
<p>The first step would be to revisit the secondary literature on Barth and the Bible and on Bonhoeffer and the Bible. Originally, I’d planned to briefly summarize this literature, mainly focusing on how what I was doing (examining particular Bible passages and reading them alongside Barth and Bonhoeffer) was different. <em>That</em> didn’t work!</p>
<p>So now it looks like I need to find an organic contribution to the secondary literature. I need to find some way that the particulars of Barth and Bonhoeffer’s theological exegesis goes beyond the portrait of the two theologians that’s been painted in the secondary literature. Hopefully I’ll be able to salvage some of my work on Genesis 1–3 and/or Matthew 5–7 to make an argument that goes beyond the secondary literature.</p>
<p>OR: I’ll realize that I have nothing of substance to contribute to this discussion, that others have done the work better than I could hope to, and I can go my not-so-merry way. In many ways, this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sunniegiles/2018/04/30/how-to-fail-faster-and-why-you-should/#6949cc94c177">“fail fast” option</a> seems preferable. I doubt that either Barth or Bonhoeffer would be happy with me for spending so much time thinking and writing about <em>their writings</em>, instead of thinking and writing about the identity and acts of the Triune God.</p>
<p>This means that, instead of transitioning to full-time work with Anglican Compass ASAP, I’m planning to remain a full-time doctoral student for this fall semester. If, by the end of the year, I don’t have any more clarity on this project, then I think I’ll throw in the towel. Perhaps I’m not supposed to be the Rev. Dr. Steele. At least not yet.</p>
<p>Sorry for the depressing post! Prayers are much appreciated. As I prepare for my fourth year as a Ph.D. student, I’m quickly running out of ideas and motivation.</p>

      <title>A Shameless Request: Help Me Buy More Books?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After realizing just how easy it was to lose access to the physical books that I own (now sequestered in my library carrel at Wheaton), on a bit of a whim &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/donate/573962246651661/&#34;&gt;I created a fundraiser to help my upgrade my Logos Bible Software library&lt;/a&gt; to either the Anglican Gold ($216) or Anglican Platinum ($582) libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading would help me in my preaching, teaching, and writing roles (as a pastor-theologian and as the Managing Editor of AnglicanCompass.com). I’ve already benefited immensely from the Anglican Silver package I bought when I got into the Logos Bible Software ecosystem a couple years ago (mainly to gain easy digital access to Barth and Bonhoeffer’s writings for my dissertation). I plan to stick with Logos—especially for biblical commentaries, systematic theologies, and reference works—because it allows me to quickly research, prepare for sermons, answer questions from readers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/573962246651661/">If you can give a few bucks, I’d be very grateful</a>! And, whether or not you give money to the fundraiser, please always feel free to send me any questions you have about Anglicanism, the Bible, Christian theology, Church history, etc.!

<p>In case you’re curious, here are some of the resources I’m most excited to own digitally in the Anglican Platinum library. I’d get 447 resources total, but here are the ones I’m most excited about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The complete Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture (I have the NT now but would gain access to the OT)</li>
<li>The Ancient Christian Doctrine Series</li>
<li>The Pillar New Testament Commentary Series</li>
<li>The Encyclopedia of Ancient Christianity</li>

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I just ordered the Valor Fitness BD-9 squat rack from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m reading Walter Sinnott-Armstrong’s excellent book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2BNTlTq&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think Again: How to Reason and Argue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it (on pages 25–26), I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules&#34;&gt;“Rapoport’s Rules.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First formulated by mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport and discussed by Daniel Dennett (&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2NmrH4m&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 31–35), here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Women&#39;s Ordination Debates in Anglicanism: The 2017 ACNA Report and the 2003 AMIA Report</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/womens-ordination-debates-in-anglicanism-the-2017-acna-report-and-the-2003-amia-report/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I became an “egalitarian” in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women’s ordination debate within Anglicanism. Growing up, the debate was all about particular Bible verses and whether or not women could teach and preach. However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I became an “egalitarian” in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.</p>
<p>It’s taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women’s ordination debate within Anglicanism. Growing up, the debate was all about particular Bible verses and whether or not women could teach and preach. However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.</p>
<p>Over at Anglican Pastor, where I’m the Managing Editor, we recently published a three-part interview with Rev. Tish Harrison Warren, who is a priest in the Anglican Church in North America [ACNA].</p>
<p>In <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/ask-an-anglican-pastor-an-interview-with-tish-harrison-warren-pt-2/">part 2 of the interview</a>, Tish answers some questions about women’s ordination.</p>
<p>This prompted some negative reactions from some of our readers, and it’s caused me to revisit <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/want-to-learn-more-about-womens-ordination-debates-within-anglicanism-start-with-these-resources/">the 2017 ACNA Holy Orders Task Force Report</a> as a starting point for coming to grips with the specifically <em>Anglican</em> debates about women’s ordination.</p>
<p>I still think that <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HolyOrdersTaskForce.pdf">the ACNA Report</a> is a fine starting point for this purpose. However, I’m disappointed that, in the “Evangelical” portion of Section 4: Arguments For and Against, the ACNA Report relies heavily upon <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AMIA_2003_Womens-Ordination-Report.pdf">this 2003 Anglican Mission in America [AMIA] Report</a>—so much so, in fact, that the ACNA Report simply quotes at length from the AMIA Report when it comes to the exegesis of specific biblical texts.</p>
<p>(See pages 269–74 of the ACNA Report and pages 37–105 of the AMIA Report to see what I mean.)</p>
<p>Nothing against the careful work shown in the 2003 AMIA Report, but it’s odd to me that the ACNA Report relies so heavily on a document that it categorizes underneath the “Books not in favor of women’s ordination” section in its Bibliography for Further Study. (See pages 303–305 of the ACNA Report.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the ACNA Report’s conclusion that “The result is a ‘text jam.&rsquo;” is perfectly justified, but I would have liked to see a little bit more direct exegetical work in this section of the ACNA document!</p>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/stickking-to-the-slow-carb-diet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, the scale read 192.4. I’d really like it to read 180 or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in lieu of how effective &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/&#34;&gt;putting money on the line via StickK&lt;/a&gt; has been for my daily writing habit these past two weeks, I’ve decided to put money on the line as motivation to stick to the Slow Carb Diet for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my writing habit, I’ve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 goes to the NRA. (I’m a pacifist. I do not like the NRA.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So, in lieu of how effective <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/">putting money on the line via StickK</a> has been for my daily writing habit these past two weeks, I’ve decided to put money on the line as motivation to stick to the Slow Carb Diet for a month.</p>
<p>For my writing habit, I’ve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 goes to the NRA. (I’m a pacifist. I do not like the NRA.)</p>
<p>For my Slow Carb Diet commitment, I’m going to keep the diet 6 days a week for 4 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 will go to NARAL Pro Choice America. (I’m pro-life. I think abortion is a tragedy.)</p>
<h2 id="try-stickk">Try StickK</h2>
<p>If there’s a habit that you’d like to develop or quit, I highly recommend giving <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/">StickK</a> a try! Fear of losing money to an organization you hate is a powerful motivator!</p>
<h2 id="try-the-slow-carb-diet">Try the Slow Carb Diet</h2>
<p>And if you’d like to lose fat/weight, I highly recommend the <a href="https://medium.com/@erinfrey/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slow-carb-diet-a67062761d92">Slow Carb Diet</a>.</p>
<p>It’s built around 5 simple rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule #1: Avoid “white” starchy carbohydrates (or those that can be white). This means all bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and grains. If you have to ask, don’t eat it.</p>
<p>Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. You already do this; you’re just picking new default meals.</p>
<p>Rule #3: Don’t drink calories. Exception: 1-2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed.</p>
<p>Rule #4: Don’t eat fruit. (Fructose –&gt; glycerol phosphate –&gt; more bodyfat, more or less.) Avocado and tomatoes are excepted.</p>
<p>Rule #5: Take one day off per week and go nuts. I choose and recommend Saturday.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/4hourbodyslowcarb/">pretty active sub-Reddit devoted to the Slow Carb Diet</a> if you’d like more information.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

&lt;p&gt;To do so, I need to write regularly. For me, that means writing every day—a minimum of 500 words every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last spring, I did a pretty good job of writing regularly. However, I’ve fallen off the wagon for various reasons, and it’s been a bear to get back on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve decided to put some money on the line, using a service called StickK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Eva Joy Steele: A Birth Story</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a self-indulgently long story. The gist of it is that my wife, Rachel, was unexpectedly induced due to gestational hypertension at 37 weeks, right before we were supposed to head to Pennsylvania for her sister’s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy induction and labor, our beautiful daughter, Eva Joy Steele, was born at 5:46am on Friday, July 20, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s all you’d like to know, great! If you’d like to know more about what went down, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>If that’s all you’d like to know, great! If you’d like to know more about what went down, keep reading.</p>
<p>Here’s a cute picture/tweet for your troubles.</p>
<p>(NOTE: The Twitter embeds/links below no longer work. Apologies! But I&rsquo;m keeping them in for posterity.)</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1020479447953301504 </figure>
<h2 id="it-all-started-on-tuesday-july-17-2018">It all started on Tuesday, July 17, 2018.</h2>
<p>The main thing <em>I</em> had scheduled that day was a get-together with my doctoral supervisor and his other students to discuss part two of our reading of Friedrich Schleiermacher’s <em>Christian Faith</em>.</p>
<p>As per usual, before diving into our book discussion, we went around the table and gave life updates. The gist of mine was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we had a bit of a “scare” last week, because Rachel’s blood pressure was slightly elevated at her midwife appointment. So, they sent us over to get an <a href="http://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/non-stress-test/">NST (fetal non-stress test)</a>, more blood pressure measurements, and an ultrasound to measure the baby.</p>
<p>Thankfully, everything looked fine. We’re pretty sure her high blood pressure is due to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/white-coat-hypertension/faq-20057792">“white coat hypertension,”</a> because her BP always looks fine at home and at work.</p>
<p>So, we’ve got another midwife appointment this afternoon, but we should be all set to drive out to Pennsylvania tomorrow for the wedding this weekend.</p>
<p><cite>~Me.</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>You see, on Saturday, July 21, Rachel’s sister, Hannah, was getting married. Rachel was the Matron of Honor, and I was the officiant for the wedding.</p>
<p>Or at least, that’s what we were planning on.</p>
<h2 id="the-midwife-appointment-400-pm-tuesday">The Midwife Appointment (4:00 pm, Tuesday)</h2>
<p>I met Rachel at Elmhurst Hospital for our midwife appointment on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Just like the previous week, her initial blood pressure was high. So, they sent us over to triage on the Labor and Delivery unit for another NST.</p>
<p>“No big deal,” we thought. “Things will come back normal again, and we’ll be on our way to Pennsylvania tomorrow.”</p>
<p>In fact, while Rachel headed over to triage, I went out to pick us up some food for dinner.</p>
<h2 id="triage-elmhurst-hospital-labor-and-delivery-unit-500pm-tuesday">Triage, Elmhurst Hospital, Labor and Delivery Unit (˜5:00pm, Tuesday)</h2>
<p>When I got over to the triage room, Mediterranean pita wraps in tow, Rachel was already hooked up to the monitors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, more than two of her BPs were higher than 140/90. To us, this didn’t seem like that big of a deal. Surely it was just a combination of nerves and stress!</p>
<p>However, Rachel met the diagnostic criteria for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_hypertension">gestational hypertension</a>. And, as a midwife explained to us in the triage room, the treatment for gestational hypertension these days is to induce labor starting at 37 weeks gestation.</p>
<p>Which, for us, meant getting induced in about 7 hours, shortly after midnight. The only other alternative was to leave <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_medical_advice">AMA: “Against Medical Advice.”</a></p>
<p>To put it lightly, this was difficult news to receive. We went from thinking that we were going to be on our way the next day to Pennsylvania for the wedding to realizing that we were going to be in the hospital until we came home with a baby!</p>
<p>So, first, there was the disappointment/stress of missing the wedding. Then, there were the other questions: Were we ready for the baby to arrive? (The nursery wasn’t due to be finished until around August 8, the due date.) Was Rachel’s body ready to deliver at 37 weeks? Was this labor and delivery more likely to end in a C-section? Would the baby be OK, or would she face health complications from being born too early?</p>
<p>The midwife reassured us that the baby was not going to be significantly more likely to have health complications from being delivered at 37 weeks vs. waiting to 38 or 39 weeks to induce labor.</p>
<p>On my end, it was helpful to hear that the reason gestational hypertension is a concern, even though it’s not as serious as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia">pre-eclampsia</a>, is that the mother’s blood pressure can very quickly and unexpectedly get out of control late in the pregnancy. There’s no way of telling on the front end, however, which mothers/babies will be fine all the way through and which will die unexpectedly. So, inducing labor at 37 weeks across the board for gestational hypertension has been determined to be the safest course of action.</p>
<p>So, while it was going to be a bummer to miss the wedding, I reassured myself/Rachel that, at least, we would get to meet our baby girl soon! Plus, even if we had been able to sweet-talk our way into a deal where they let us go home and come back for blood pressure checks each day, I wasn’t sure that “freedom” would be worth the extra stress.</p>
<h2 id="admitted-to-elmhurst-hospital-labor-and-delivery-unit-700pm-tuesday">Admitted to Elmhurst Hospital, Labor and Delivery Unit (˜7:00pm, Tuesday)</h2>
<p>So, we literally walked right across the hallway from triage to our pre-partum hospital room on the Labor and Delivery unit.</p>
<p>After getting settled, we began the process of letting friends and family know what was happening.</p>
<p>I let my doctoral supervisor and fellow students know that I had spoken too soon that afternoon, and that we wouldn’t be making the trip out to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I also let our landlord know that we would be needing that baby room finished sooner than initially expected!</p>
<p>And, as I headed back home to grab supplies for our stay at the hospital, I called my parents to let them know that their granddaughter would be arriving sooner than expected.</p>
<p>Back at the apartment by myself, calling Rachel to double-check what she needed in her “go-bag,” it was a bit surreal to realize that, most likely, the next time I would come home we would have our daughter with us!</p>
<p>I somewhat frantically tidied-up the apartment (“I don’t want our baby to come home to a messy house!”) and packed our bags before heading back to the hospital.</p>
<h2 id="induction-starts-cervidil-1230-am--1230-pm-wednesday">INDUCTION STARTS: Cervidil (˜12:30 am – 12:30 pm, Wednesday)</h2>
<p>The induction process started around 12:30 am with the insertion of a medicine called <a href="https://www.thebump.com/a/cervidil">Cervidil</a> to soften the cervix.</p>
<p>Despite our hopes that things would start to progress rather quickly, Wednesday was a looooooong day. Looking back, I can tell that this was the case because I had time to tweet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019570011952861184 </figure>
<p>Also, I figured that now was as good a time as any to ask for some last-minute parenting advice.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019606474115420160 </figure>
<p>By the way, my friend Ryan Clevenger wins the award for best dad advice given in response to my tweet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/Nazianzenus/status/1019641823030112261 </figure>
<p>Anyways, the first round of Cervidil lasted 12 hours. After they took the Cervidil out, they checked and Rachel was barely dilated.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they decided to try to insert what is called the Cook Cervical Ripening Balloon, AKA the Cook catheter.</p>
<h2 id="cook-cervical-ripening-balloon-unsuccessful-attempt-1-130-pm-wednesday">Cook Cervical Ripening Balloon, Unsuccessful Attempt #1 (1:30 pm, Wednesday)</h2>
<p>Here’s a picture of what we’re talking about.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cook-Catheter.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>They insert that thing through the cervix, before inflating those balloons on both sides of the cervix.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cook-Catheter-Insertion.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Or, at least, that’s how it’s <em>supposed</em> to go.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they weren’t able to get this thing in on Wednesday afternoon. According to Rachel, it was extremely painful. It was difficult to watch her go through it.</p>
<p>So, after giving her a bit of break, the midwife recommended starting Pitocin.</p>
<h2 id="started-pitocin-400pm-wednesday">Started Pitocin (4:00pm, Wednesday)</h2>
<p>After the unsuccessful insertion of the Cook catheter, they decided to monitor Rachel to see if any regular contractions started. No dice.</p>
<p>After talking with our doula, Teri, on the phone, we decided to start Pitocin on Wednesday afternoon. If you’re curious, <a href="https://www.thebump.com/a/pitocin">here’s some more information about Pitocin and what it does.</a></p>
<p>So, they started Pitocin at around 4:00pm on Wednesday. Just like Cervidil, the first round lasted approximately 12 hours.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019780168326565889 </figure>
<h3 id="to-eat-or-not-to-eat">To Eat, or Not to Eat</h3>
<p>Apparently, normal hospital protocol is that you’re only allowed to consume clear liquids while on Pitocin. We’d heard from various people that this was a load of crap. However, the midwife who was there when we started Pitocin still said “clear liquids only.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we still snuck Rachel snacks when nurses weren’t in the room!</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, we met with a different midwife to discuss how things were progressing. She said “You’re eating, right?,” and then we told her about our clear liquid instructions.</p>
<p>“No no no, you (looks at me) go get her some dinner, OK?”</p>
<p>Best. midwife. ever. I went and got Rachel some Pad Thai.</p>
<p>We also discussed with the midwife what would happen if things didn’t progress at all over night. She said that, if NOTHING had changed in the morning, that they would consider another consult with maternal and fetal medicine doctors to see if we could be sent home for 24 hours before returning to re-start the induction process.</p>
<p>However, she said, if things had moved along enough to allow for the insertion of the Cook catheter, then we would proceed until the baby arrived.</p>
<h2 id="off-pitocin-530-am-thursday">Off Pitocin (5:30 am, Thursday)</h2>
<p>At around 5:30 am, Rachel came off her first round of Pitocin. They checked, and she was only dilated to 1cm. This was kind of a bummer. 29 hours after induction began, with only a measly centimeter to show for it!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this was still progress. So, the next thing we decided to try was the insertion of the Cook catheter again.</p>
<p>Before doing so, Rachel got another break, during which she drank some coffee, ate breakfast, took a shower, etc. Honestly, she seemed pretty chipper at this point. Which was good, because things were about to get going!</p>
<h2 id="labor-starts-cook-catheter-successful-attempt-2-830-am-thursday">LABOR STARTS: Cook Catheter, Successful Attempt #2 (8:30 am, Thursday)</h2>
<p>Thankfully, the second time was a charm. They were able to successfully insert the Cook catheter on Thursday morning at 8:30. (Although, it took another three tries. According to Rachel, the first two were quite painful but the third, when it was successfully in place, didn’t feel that bad.)</p>
<p>After this, however, Rachel started feeling worse/bad and contractions started to pick up. From my perspective, the difference between Rachel at 8:00am and Rachel at 10:00am was enormous.</p>
<p>Looking back, we’d say that labor started around this time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what also started around this time was <em>vomiting</em> (Rachel, not me). I wrote down the first times: 0912, 0945, 1050, 1121, 1215, 1430, 1605… Then, in my notebook, I just have “… (more times).” It was rough.</p>
<h2 id="back-on-pitocin-1030-am-thursday">Back on Pitocin (10:30 am, Thursday)</h2>
<p>Things were progressing, but they didn’t exactly take off after the Cook catheter was in. So, it was back on Pitocin.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019982256037859329 </figure>
<p>Rachel’s contractions were getting more and more painful. Specifically, she was complaining about pain/tension in her lower back.</p>
<p>What’s more, she was getting to the point where she had to stop talking during contractions. This despite her insistence that, while she <em>could</em> talk through the contractions if she really wanted to, it was easier not to talk…</p>
<p>Between that and the vomiting, I suggested that we give our doula a call and ask her to come in.</p>
<h2 id="doula-teri-arrives-100-pm-thursday">Doula Teri Arrives (1:00 pm, Thursday)</h2>
<p>Teri, our doula, arrived at about 1:00 pm on Thursday. Rachel wasn’t doing so hot by then, and I was very glad to have someone else there for more support.</p>
<p>The way things were going, with the back pain and the vomiting, I wasn’t sure how much longer we’d be able to handle things on our own without someone a bit more knowledgeable there to support us.</p>
<h2 id="turning-babies-stressful-nurses-thursday-afternoon">Turning Babies, Stressful Nurses (Thursday Afternoon)</h2>
<p>Thanks be to God that Teri came when she did!</p>
<p>With some coordinated hip movements, she was able to turn the baby around and relieve Rachel’s back pain! Rachel said that it was the weirdest thing ever feeling the baby turn around, and it brought pretty much instant relief.</p>
<p>So, even though her contractions kept getting more intense, they were easier to bear without the pain being concentrated in her lower back.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Thursday afternoon wasn’t all rainbows and butterflies.</p>
<p>For one thing, despite the relief in back pain, contractions were still picking up. At one point, they were about 2.5 minutes apart and pretty intense.</p>
<p>However, we got a new nurse at this point, and she really just stressed us out. She meant well, to be sure, but her ways of handling things were quite different than any of the other nurses we had throughout the process.</p>
<p>Whenever she would come into the room, which she did rather frequently, Rachel’s contractions would slow down or get erratic. This made the nurse (and the midwife) want to crank up the Pitocin. It wasn’t the greatest afternoon.</p>
<p>However, that nurse eventually left. Also, Rachel was able to get a decent nap in… THROUGH some pretty intense contractions! (Teri and I were pretty surprised, looking at the monitor, watching the contractions come, without a peep or change in facial expression from Rachel as she slept.)</p>
<h2 id="removed-cook-catheter-800pm-thursday">Removed Cook Catheter (8:00pm, Thursday)</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1020115308634361857 </figure>
<p>There’s something about 12 hour rounds of things during induction/labor. So, at 8:00pm or so, they took out the Cook catheter.</p>
<p>After a pretty intense afternoon, Rachel was dilated to (*drumroll*) … 3cm!</p>
<p>43.5 hours for 3 centimeters. Sure, progress. But SLOW!</p>
<p>The midwife recommended breaking the bag of waters to move things along. After being reassured that this wouldn’t put us “on a clock” before they would intervene with a C-section, we decided to go ahead with that plan.</p>
<h2 id="broke-bag-of-waters-transferred-to-labor-and-delivery-room-850-pm-thursday">Broke Bag of Waters, Transferred to Labor and Delivery Room (8:50 pm, Thursday)</h2>
<p>Let me tell you, I didn’t realize how quickly they would get equipment ready and break the bag of waters!</p>
<p>We made the call to break the bag. I stepped into the restroom to pee, and by the time I got back out they were right in the middle of the procedure there on the bed!</p>
<p>Thankfully, after this, they moved us to an actual labor and delivery room down the hall. We hoped that things would start to pick up, which was the goal of breaking the bag of waters, after all…</p>
<h2 id="slow-down-900-pm-thursday--1200-am-friday">Slow Down (9:00 pm, Thursday – 12:00 am, Friday)</h2>
<p>However, things slowed back down. This did allow Rachel to take a shower and sleep for another hour or so, but it was concerning that we appeared to be moving backward.</p>
<p>As Rachel slept for a while, Teri sat in the recliner in the corner and I laid down on the couch.</p>
<p>I couldn’t sleep at all. I was watching her contractions get slower and slower on the monitor and wondering how much longer this process was going to go on for. I mean, sure, Rachel is a BOSS. But everyone has their limits. How much longer of an induction/labor process would she be able to take?</p>
<p>After she got some rest, we got Rachel up and moving around. Her and I took a couple laps around the Labor and Delivery unit.</p>
<h2 id="pick-back-up-1200--230-am-friday">Pick Back Up (12:00 – 2:30 am, Friday)</h2>
<p>Thankfully, the movement and changing positions got things going again.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t remember too much about this period. I was purposefully just trying to stay awake and not pay too much attention to the clock.</p>
<p>At one point, however, after trying out various positions, we got Rachel into a good groove of contractions while she sat upright, cross-legged, in the bed—like some sort of pregnant zen master!</p>
<p>At 2:30am, they checked Rachel again. She was dilated to (*tired drumroll*) … 5cm.</p>
<p>My heart kind of sank at this point, because I didn’t know whether to expect things to really get moving, or to expect that we would spend all day/night Friday in labor.</p>
<h2 id="three-hours-in-hell-230--530-am-friday">Three Hours in Hell (2:30 – 5:30 am, Friday)</h2>
<p>Thankfully, things really started to move along.</p>
<p>Granted, I say “thankfully,” but this was really the most intense three hours of the whole process.</p>
<p>The midwife who was on at that point was willing to allow Rachel to labor for awhile in the tub, which she was looking forward to.</p>
<p>However, because Rachel was on Pitocin, she was on continuous fetal monitoring… these two sensors they put around her stomach, to measure contractions and the baby’s heart rate.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t doubt that these monitors can prove incredibly helpful. But they can also be really freaking annoying. It is so easy to lose the baby’s heart rate whenever the mom moves. Then a nurse has to come back in and readjust the monitor until they find the heart rate again. But then mom or baby moves like two minutes later and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p>So, before they were going to let Rachel get in the tub, they wanted her to lie down on her back in the bed so that they could get a good 30 minutes of the baby’s heart rate on the monitor to make sure things were OK.</p>
<p>Rachel was not happy about this because lying on her back was the least comfortable position for her to be in. However, she endured, and made it to the tub.</p>
<p>The tub is where, eventually, Rachel got to “transition” or “transitional labor.” <a href="https://www.thebump.com/a/transitional-labor">You can read more about it here</a>. Suffice it to say that it’s usually the most intense part of labor.</p>
<p>Things were a blur by this point: Tub. Toilet. Tub. Bed. Birthing Ball. Tub. Vomit/retching.</p>
<p>At one point, between the hunger, exhaustion, the deep breathing I was doing with Rachel during her contractions, and kneeling beside the tub holding the puke bucket as she vomited…I began to get nauseous myself!</p>
<p>I asked Teri to go grab me a ginger ale, and I snuck swigs of ginger all and bites of a Clif Bar between Rachel’s contractions in the tub.</p>
<p>Again, at this point, I was purposefully trying not to pay attention to the clock. Sure, things seemed to be moving along now. I’d read in the books that when the mom said “I can’t do this anymore,” that usually meant they were in transition, which meant they were about ready to push…</p>
<p>But, at 2:30 am Rachel had only been at 5 centimeters. So, it didn’t seem wise to get my hopes up. And yet, here my wife was, throwing up over the side of the tub during contractions and saying she didn’t know how much longer she could do this for.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 5:15–5:30, the midwife and her student came in and checked Rachel again, because she was complaining of increased pressure down low.</p>
<p>At this point, I was praying that she was at least 8cm dilated. If not, based on how intense things had just gotten, I wasn’t sure how much longer Rachel would make it without, at the very least, some nitrous gas for pain management.</p>
<p>However, thanks be to God, she was dilated to…9.5cm!</p>
<h2 id="but-i-have-to-push-530546-am-friday">“BUT I HAVE TO PUSH!” (5:30–5:46 am, Friday)</h2>
<p>Now, if you’re in the know, you realize that 9.5cm doesn’t quite cut it. 10cm is the magic dilation number.</p>
<p>SO, although I personally took the 9.5cm news as a comforting blessing and relief from the Lord, for Rachel things got more intense for a bit.</p>
<p>As it’s been described to me, every fiber of her being was urging her to push that baby out, but I and everyone else in the room were urging her NOT to push until she reached full (10cm) dilation.</p>
<p>I was feeling: “YES! Thank God! We’re almost there! We don’t have to endure another full day of labor!!”</p>
<p>They turned the lights up in the room as more people entered to get things ready for delivery. Teri and I focused on keeping Rachel from pushing for as long as we could.</p>
<p>Eventually, the midwife went to check Rachel’s dilation again, and said: “Aaaand, the baby’s head is already through the cervix!”</p>
<p>Rachel: “DOES THAT MEAN I CAN PUSH?!”</p>
<p>Midwife: “Yep! You can push!”</p>
<p>Rachel only ended up pushing for 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>Now, I usually don’t do well with blood, etc., but for some reason I was perfectly fine watching the whole thing as our daughter came out. It was wild. It took awhile to see her head coming, but then, boom!, she was all the way out and screaming!</p>
<h2 id="baby-arrives-eva-joy-steele-was-born-at-546-am-on-friday-july-20-2018">BABY ARRIVES: Eva Joy Steele was born at 5:46 am on Friday, July 20, 2018.</h2>
<p>She weighed 5lbs 8oz, she was 18 inches long, and she has been worth every minute of that lengthy labor and delivery!</p>
<p>Looking back, apart from the initial frustration about getting induced at 37 weeks, we felt very well cared for by the midwives and nurses at Elmhurst. We didn’t feel pressured into moving things along quicker than we felt comfortable with, and we’re very thankful for the medical care that Rachel and Eva received.</p>
<p>Also, we’re incredibly grateful to our doula, Teri, for her support along the way. Even if the only thing she had done was to turn the baby around, that would have been enough! But she went above and beyond throughout the rest of the process, and we’re very thankful she was there with us.</p>
<p>For me, after going through this with my wife, I’m even more impressed by what a strong woman she is. I already knew that she had grit, but making through such a long process without any kind of pain medication was nothing short of amazing.</p>

<p>With Rachel and Eva, I think we’ve got a pretty great team.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, consider yourself quite the introvert. Maybe you, like me, have a difficult time walking the tightrope between feeling quickly overwhelmed by interpersonal relationships, on the one hand, and feeling incredibly lonely, on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I’m sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be “alone together,” looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I’m sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be “alone together,” looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).</p>
<p>Maybe we’re not alone.</p>
<h1 id="the-lonely-american-man">The Lonely American Man</h1>
<p>I just got done listening to a fantastic episode of the podcast Hidden Brain called <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/594719471/guys-we-have-a-problem-how-american-masculinity-creates-lonely-men">The Lonely American Man</a>.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you give this episode a listen, because it’s devoted to an important topic: how certain Western/American ideals of masculinity – the mythic man as a rugged individualist, needing no one in order to succeed – have led to men feeling increasingly isolated and lonely as they grow older.</p>
<p>I really resonated with this episode. Although my current role as a Ph.D. student (and my previous roles as a high school student, college student, and then a seminarian) have included some built-in male “acquaintances/colleagues,” at the very least, I’ve recognized how each stage has felt increasingly lonely. In fact, my closest male friendships now are with a couple people I know from high school – and we only see each other in person 1 or 2 times a year.</p>
<p>Sure, I spend more time face-to-face with my male Ph.D. colleagues, but we’re all just so busy. School, work, marriage, kids, etc. At least for me, in addition to feeling the pressure to not be overly emotional or vulnerable, there’s the added pressure of not wanting to burden other people. I know they’re busy. They know I’m busy. So, we end up just leaving each other alone, persuaded that’s what will make us happy (even if we feel terribly lonely).</p>
<p>If you listen to the end of the podcast episode I linked to above, you’ll hear about an interesting study/experiment performed on commuters. When given the choice/assignment of (1) not interacting with other commuters, (2) interacting with other commuters, and (3) carrying on as normal during their commute, people predicted that they would be happiest – and that other people would be happiest! – when they just stayed out of each other’s way. However, it turns out that we’re much happier when connecting with other people, and that other people are much more willing to connect with us than we often imagine!</p>
<h1 id="men-how-can-we-do-better">Men, How Can We Do Better?</h1>
<p>I need to do a better job of taking these things to heart in how I go about my daily life. Although I truly <em>am</em> an introvert – meaning that I need some time alone each day in order to recharge – I’m persuaded that I could benefit from some more meaningful friendships in my life – especially some more face-to-face friendships.</p>
<p>Although I’m sure there’s other great stuff on this topic out there, if you’re interested in this topic, I highly recommend the following posts from The Art of Manliness:</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting Things Done (&amp;ldquo;GTD&amp;rdquo; for short) is a widely popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifehacker.com/getting-things-done-ten-years-in-1795707084&#34;&gt;Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;You don’t hear a lot of people talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gettingthingsdone.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; productivity system anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s a shame because it’s a very effective system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first tried Getting Things Done after reading &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2tMiX1w&#34;&gt;What’s Best Next&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Matt Perman and then reading &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2HvNJxv&#34;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting Things Done (&ldquo;GTD&rdquo; for short) is a widely popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/getting-things-done-ten-years-in-1795707084">Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017</a>, &ldquo;You don’t hear a lot of people talk about the <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> productivity system anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that’s a shame because it’s a very effective system.</p>
<p>I first tried Getting Things Done after reading &ldquo;<a href="http://amzn.to/2tMiX1w">What’s Best Next</a>&rdquo; by Matt Perman and then reading &ldquo;<a href="http://amzn.to/2HvNJxv">Getting Things Done</a>&rdquo; by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>At its core, GTD revolves around the following idea from David Allen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What does that mean? Well, your brain does a much better job of coming up with random things than keeping track of them. Therefore, if you don’t have a system in place for reliably and comprehensively keeping track of all the random “open loops” your brain comes up with throughout the day, you will use up a lot of your mental bandwidth trying to remember everything instead of acting on them.</p>
<p>Enter the GTD system. It’s designed to solve the problem of tracking the “open loops” your brain creates—whether &ldquo;I need to buy milk&rdquo; or &ldquo;I need to revamp my blog.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-pillars-of-gtd">The &ldquo;Pillars&rdquo; of GTD</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Capture</strong>: Think on paper. Get stuff out of your head and into a list.</li>
<li><strong>Clarify</strong>: Decide whether each item is an action, a project, something to delete, defer, or delegate, etc. <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf">GTD Workflow Chart</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Organize</strong>: As you clarify, put things into different “buckets” – Action Lists, Project Lists, Someday/Maybe Lists, Waiting For Lists, Reference Materials, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong>: Look at your buckets regularly—daily and weekly.</li>
<li><strong>Engage</strong>: You know, get stuff done.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="getting-back-on-the-gtd-bandwagon">Getting Back on the GTD Bandwagon</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, after following GTD for a few years, I “fell off the bandwagon.” I got sloppy with capturing and clarifying my “open loops,” leading to more time worrying about what I had to do instead of reviewing my &ldquo;Next Action&rdquo; lists and moving forward, GTD-style.</p>
<p>Just this past week, I decided to get back on the GTD bandwagon. I’ve got a Ph.D. dissertation to write and a baby on the way, after all! There’s no time to spend worrying about things I’m forgetting. 🙂</p>

      <title>This Song is a Beautiful Picture of the Theological Journey</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-truth-is-not-a-cave/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently privileged to see one of my favorite bands, &lt;a href=&#34;http://theohhellos.com/&#34;&gt;The Oh Hellos&lt;/a&gt;, in concert at the House of Blues in downtown Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love all of The Oh Hellos’ music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it. The song is called “The Truth is a Cave,” and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I’m calling “the theological journey” – the stages one goes through in one’s knowledge of God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently privileged to see one of my favorite bands, <a href="http://theohhellos.com/">The Oh Hellos</a>, in concert at the House of Blues in downtown Chicago.</p>
<p>I love all of The Oh Hellos’ music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it. The song is called “The Truth is a Cave,” and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I’m calling “the theological journey” – the stages one goes through in one’s knowledge of God.</p>
<h1 id="the-truth-is-not-a-cave">The Truth is [NOT] a Cave</h1>
<p>Here’s a video. Give the song a listen.</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="563" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTMObl4CqoU?feature=oembed" title="The Truth Is A Cave - The Oh Hello's" width="750"></iframe>
<p>Here are the lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was young and naive<br>
As I was told, so I believed<br>
And I was told there’s only one road that leads you home</p>
<p>And the truth was a cave on the mountainside<br>
And I’d seek it out until the day I died</p>
<p>I was bound and determined<br>
To be the child that you wanted<br>
But I was blind to every sign you left for me to find</p>
<p>And the truth became a tool that I held in my hand<br>
I wielded it, but I didn’t understand</p>
<p>I got tired of giving more than you gave to me<br>
And I desired a truth I wouldn’t have to seek</p>
<p>But in the silence, I heard you calling out to me</p></blockquote>
<h1 id="the-truth-is-neither-a-position-nor-a-possession-but-a-person">The Truth is neither a Position, nor a Possession, but a Person.</h1>
<p>ˆThere’s my summary of the song’s message in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Verse one portrays the truth as a distant and unattainable cave. I think that’s where we all start off in our theological journeys. The danger at this beginning stage is that God feels very distant and aloof. If we’re not careful, we can tire out and despair while “seeking out [the truth] until the day [we] die.”</p>
<p>However, things don’t get any better in verse two, where the truth is a tool. We, especially formal students of theology like myself, can quickly get caught up in our zeal for theological truth (“I was bound and determined / To be the child that you wanted”), missing the ways in which God actually wants to speak to us (“But I was blind to every sign you left for me to find”).</p>
<p>The result? We act like the truth about God is something we can possess and use to our own advantage. We treat theology like a swordfight or a dojo.</p>
<p>This gets us to verse three, the stage of the burnt-out theologian: “I got tired of giving more than you gave to me. And I desired a truth I wouldn’t have to seek.”</p>
<p>I could pretend like I don’t know why those words often bring tears to my eyes, but I do.</p>
<p>Pour your heart, mind, and soul into the theological task – as if it all depends on you and your zealous efforts to plumb the depths of the divine mysteries – and you will be brought to anger and/or despair by a world that so often feels godless, if not god-forsaken.</p>
<p>Good news, though: It doesn’t all depend on you and your theological efforts. God reveals himself to us, even (especially) when we least expect it: “But in the silence, I heard you calling out to me.”</p>
<p>Good news: The truth isn’t a cave.</p>
<p>The truth isn’t a tool.</p>
<p>The truth is a Person. Have you met the Truth?</p>

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the trip was to visit some good friends of ours, the Smith family, in Phoenix, AZ. Here’s a picture of the group of us together after church at &lt;a href=&#34;https://livingfaithanglican.org/&#34;&gt;Living Faith Anglican Church in Tempe, AZ&lt;/a&gt;, where my friend Peter Smith is the rector.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The trip was a blast. It was great to catch up with the Smiths and to see their new home and church in Arizona.</p>
<p>Plus, we got to go hiking at (1) Saguaro Lake,</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3663.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>and (3) the South Kaibab Trail at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3743.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>(That last photo is my favorite from the entire trip. Thanks to the random guy on the trail who took it for us!)</p>
<p>Having never been to the Southwest before, I was frequently overwhelmed by the beauty of the views and the landscape. At certain points, it didn’t even feel real.</p>
<h3 id="however-something-else-struck-me-about-the-views-and-the-landscape-the-combination-of-danger-and-beauty">However, something else struck me about the views and the landscape: the combination of danger and beauty.</h3>
<p>At the Grand Canyon, this was especially obvious when we considered how high above the canyon floor we were during our hike. However, even when we weren’t sitting or standing on a precarious ledge, even when we were standing on flat ground, we were still in the middle of the desert! Without food, water, shelter, and transportation, the beautiful landscape would have made short work of us.</p>
<h3 id="this-has-me-thinking-about-the-relationships-between-beauty-safety-and-danger-in-other-areas-of-life">This has me thinking about the relationships between beauty, safety, and danger in other areas of life.</h3>
<p>We’d love it, wouldn’t we, if the most beautiful things/experiences were always safe. But they aren’t.</p>
<p>There’s frequently risk and danger involved in life’s most beautiful and meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that we ought to live life recklessly, with no concern for the risks and dangers involved!</p>
<p>But it is a good reminder that we are, perhaps, more concerned with safety and risk-mitigation than God is.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-any-examples-of-dangerous-risky-beauty-in-your-own-life-id-love-to-hear-about-them-in-the-comments-below">Do you have any examples of dangerous, risky beauty in your own life? I’d love to hear about them in the comments below!</h3>

      <title>3 Confessions of an Expectant Father</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/3-confessions-expectant-father/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;were-expecting&#34;&gt;We’re Expecting!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you haven’t heard the news, my wife Rachel and I are expecting our firstborn child this August! Rachel is currently 16 weeks along, and we won’t find out the gender of the baby (whom I am affectionately calling “Lump”) for another month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_3515-e1519734672450-1024x777.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-last-few-months-have-been-quite-busy-for-us-since-we-found-out-rachel-is-pregnant&#34;&gt;The last few months have been quite busy for us since we found out Rachel is pregnant.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She works full-time as a Family Nurse Practitioner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m a full-time Ph.D. student.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re both actively involved in our church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc. etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We’ll be traveling for our siblings’ high school graduation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Lord-willing and baby-waiting) we’ll both be in my sister-in-law’s wedding this Summer (I’m the officiant).&lt;/li&gt;

<h2 id="3-confessions-of-an-expectant-father">3 Confessions of an Expectant Father</h2>
<p>Anyways, this might be a bit self-serving, but amidst all the busyness, I thought I’d take a few minutes to write down some of my thoughts and feelings as I await the birth of my firstborn child.</p>
<p>(I’ve been inspired to do this by reading the extremely helpful <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2F0eMQv">The Expectant Father: The Ultimate Guide for Dads-to-Be</a></em> [affiliate link]. I highly recommend it to you if it’s relevant to your situation!)</p>
<p>OK, here goes:</p>
<h3 id="1-im-anxious-and-stressed">1. I’m Anxious and Stressed</h3>
<p>I’m not necessarily putting this first because I feel it the strongest/most, but rather because I’m the most embarrassed by it!</p>
<p>I’m anxious and stressed when it comes to my future as a parent, largely because the future has an annoying tendency to remain unknown! As a perfectionist – as a 1 on the Enneagram (check out <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2BTmugK">The Road Back to You</a></em> [affiliate link] if you don’t know what that means) – I don’t like such uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if there are health complications with the pregnancy, delivery, or the baby?</li>
<li>How will we navigate all of the complexities of parenting?</li>
<li>What will our new schedule/life look like?</li>
<li>How will we deal with the sleep deprivation?!</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, something that’s weighing particularly heavy on me right now is: <strong>How will I provide for my family?</strong></p>
<p>Rachel’s been earning the lion’s share of our income for the duration of our marriage, first as a Registered Nurse and now as a Family Nurse Practitioner. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, by the way. She’s crazy good at what she does, and her earning potential as an RN and FNP has been quite higher than mine as a seminarian and now a Ph.D. student!</p>
<p>However, with a baby on the way, we’d like for Rachel to be able to stay at home as much as she would like to as soon as possible after the baby’s born. And, as a Ph.D. student who wants to become a pastor-theologian (check out <a href="http://amzn.to/2F9xCbu"><em>The Pastor Theologian</em></a> [affiliate link] if you don’t know what that means), my earning potential isn’t exactly skyrocketing right now.</p>
<p>This is forcing me to get creative and try to come up with ideas for an extra source(s) of income (“side hustles,” as they’re called – check out <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2ovTvbe">Side Hustle: From Idea to Income in 27 Days</a></em> [affiliate link] to learn more). However, getting creative is hard work, of course!</p>
<p>Anyways, there’s just a glimpse of my stress/anxiety.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that’s not all that’s on my mind and heart!</p>
<h3 id="2-im-thankful-and-grateful">2. I’m Thankful and Grateful</h3>
<p>First and foremost, I’m grateful to <strong>God</strong> for providing the gift of a new life and entrusting it to our care.</p>
<p>Second, I’m thankful for my <strong>wife</strong>. Rachel is amazing. She’s going to be a fantastic mother, and there’s no one else I’d rather be a parent alongside!</p>
<p>However, I have also experienced a recent spike in gratitude for my <strong>parents</strong>. It’s crazy to think that, about 27 years ago, my parents were in the exact same situation, and <em>I</em> was the firstborn child on the way, about to change their lives forever!</p>
<p>27 years later, and I’ve been the recipient of countless acts of selfless love and generosity from Patrick and Donna Steele. I’m incredibly grateful for such loving and God-fearing parents (to say nothing of my loving and God-fearing in-laws!). I hope to pay the parenting gift forward, as it were, to the next generation.</p>
<h3 id="3-im-pumped-and-excited">3. I’m Pumped and Excited</h3>
<p>Yes, I’m anxious. Sure, I’m grateful. But I’m also pumped! I’m excited to be a dad!</p>
<p>Rachel and I have always loved children. In fact, I’ve developed a reputation as “The Baby Whisperer” in recent years (we’ll see how long that lasts).</p>
<p>Now, we get to raise a child of our own!</p>
<p>Will we desperately need the Lord’s help at every step of the way? You bet!</p>
<p>Thankfully, we serve a God who is ready and willing to provide such help!</p>

      <title>Testimony: A Faith Story, In Brief</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/testimony-brief/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2017 07:00:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/testimony-brief/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an attempt to tell my testimony, the story of my Christian faith, in approximately 500 words. It was challenging to do, but also a helpful exercise! I challenge you to write out your own story in approximately 500 words.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;testimony&#34;&gt;Testimony&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as long as I can remember, I have known and followed Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. However, there has been a lingering problem in our relationship – on my end. Of course, this problem is called “sin.” But, I mean an even more specific problem: my struggle to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; Jesus, and not merely to know &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is an attempt to tell my testimony, the story of my Christian faith, in approximately 500 words. It was challenging to do, but also a helpful exercise! I challenge you to write out your own story in approximately 500 words.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="testimony">Testimony</h1>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have known and followed Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. However, there has been a lingering problem in our relationship – on my end. Of course, this problem is called “sin.” But, I mean an even more specific problem: my struggle to <em>know</em> Jesus, and not merely to know <em>about</em> Jesus.</p>
<p>(For an attempted summary of the <em>content</em> of my Christian faith, what I believe, see <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2015/12/08/a-crucicentric-credo/">“What Do I Believe? A Cross-Centered Credo.”</a>)</p>
<h2 id="childhood">Childhood</h2>
<p>I have always placed a high premium on knowing and telling the truth. As a precocious five-year-old, an intellectual conundrum led me to ask my father how we could be brothers in Christ, though I was his son.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he did not respond with a merely intellectual explanation, but rather a gospel presentation. I prayed the “Sinner’s Prayer,” and my faith journey since then has been a long lesson that real Truth is not a proposition to comprehend, nor a weapon to wield, but a person to love, trust, and obey.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have often found it easier to wage intellectual battle than to trust and obey. Knowing all the right answers in Sunday School did little to assuage my pride, lust, anger, and fear.</p>
<p>Thankfully, however, Christ has not given up on me. Instead, through his Word and Church, he has reminded me time and time again that my intellect is to be used in loving, self-sacrificial service – and not in self-defense.</p>
<h2 id="high-school">High School</h2>
<p>In high school, Christ opened my eyes to a world in need and gave me a glimpse of how the gifts he had given me might be used to meet the world’s needs.</p>
<p>However, to my shame, I had devoted more time and effort into learning things like calculus and Spanish than to learning the gospel. For this reason, I decided to devote my undergraduate studies to learning the gospel in order to preach it to others. I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Preseminary Bible just three weeks before classes began.</p>
<h2 id="college">College</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/tag/cedarville/">college</a>, I fell in love with the gospel, with biblical and theological studies, and with a young nursing student who loved Jesus and wanted to use her gifts (medical and otherwise) to serve him.</p>
<p>We decided to follow Christ together as husband and wife. After we were married in 2012, God opened the doors for us to come to Birmingham, AL, where I have continued my pastoral training at Beeson Divinity School and served as a Youth Minister at St. Peter’s Anglican Church. My wife has lovingly cared for the sick and the poor, first as a Registered Nurse, and now as a Nurse Practitioner.</p>
<p>(Want to read my wedding vows? You can do so <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/08/14/wedding-vows/">here</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="seminary-and-beyond">Seminary and Beyond</h2>
<p>Seminary (<a href="https://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>), youth ministry, and my recent ordination to the diaconate have confirmed my pastoral calling. I want to spend the rest of my life serving the world by serving the Church. That is, I want to advance God’s kingdom academically, globally, and pastorally as part professor, missionary, and (primarily a) pastor.</p>
<p>Although merely knowing <em>about</em> Jesus is still a temptation, I know that my Savior is faithful. He can use my life to help heal a world that desperately needs to <em>know</em> him.</p>

      <title>Thank God, I Went to Cedarville</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/thank-god-i-went-to-cedarville/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2016 20:20:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/thank-god-i-went-to-cedarville/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I prepare for my final semester at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt;, it strikes me just how well I was prepared for my seminary education by my undergraduate professors at Cedarville University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered, my time at CU &lt;strong&gt;exposed me to the riches of biblical and theological studies, and it left me hungry for more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College gave me a &lt;strong&gt;love for Christ’s gospel and Christ’s Church&lt;/strong&gt; – which has only increased since I arrived at Beeson.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I prepare for my final semester at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>, it strikes me just how well I was prepared for my seminary education by my undergraduate professors at Cedarville University.</p>
<p>All things considered, my time at CU <strong>exposed me to the riches of biblical and theological studies, and it left me hungry for more</strong>.</p>
<p>College gave me a <strong>love for Christ’s gospel and Christ’s Church</strong> – which has only increased since I arrived at Beeson.</p>
<p>Plus, I met my wife there! 🙂</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pablo-10-300x300.png" alt="pablo (10)"  />
</p>
<p>And yet, college also <em><strong>left a bad taste in my mouth</strong></em>.</p>
<p>See, in the year before I graduated, <a href="https://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">some crazy things went down</a> at my alma mater.</p>
<ul>
<li>It all started with some <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Job-Openings/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">sketchy White Papers</a> getting sprung on the faculty right before contract renewal.</li>
<li>Then, it led to the secret summer firing of a professor.</li>
<li>I reacted <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/">on</a> <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/21/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-2/">my</a> <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/22/an-explanation/">blog</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november/crisis-of-faith-statements.html">Christianity Today</a> picked it up. As well as <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/cedarville-plays-professor-on-leave/nSwDJ/">a local newspaper</a>.</li>
<li>The same day the Christianity Today piece ran, the President “resigned.”</li>
<li>So did the Vice President of Student Life.</li>
<li>You know what? It’s a long story, just <a href="https://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">read it here if you’re interested</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Between my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/">original blogpost</a> and my “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/04/24/a-farewell-to-cedarville/">final farewell,</a>” I tried to take a pretty active role in the student protests against what was going on at CU.</p>
<p>I’d like to think we made a bit of a difference – perhaps in slowing things down enough to let professors find jobs elsewhere before they got fired. Heck, we even made it into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/us/a-christian-college-struggles-to-define-itself.html">The New York Times</a>. (Although, I will say: I’m embarrassed of the picture they chose for the article.)</p>
<p>However, in the long run, <strong>we failed</strong>.</p>
<p>Cedarville is now a much different place than when I arrived. What’s more, I became so entangled in the mess that I arrived to seminary with some burn wounds – from a prophetic fire that burnt a bit too hot.</p>
<p>I’m <strong>thankful</strong> for my time at Cedarville, however.</p>
<p>God has been healing those wounds. Beeson Divinity School and Anglicanism have both been balms to my spirit. And, with the healing has come the realization that I would not be who I am today were it not for my four years in Cedarville, Ohio.</p>
<p>Many of the lessons I learned there were sealed with blood, sweat, and tears – as it were. However, those kinds of lessons are often the most important and enduring.</p>
<p>By God’s grace, I hope to carry forward into my future ministry a combination of prophetic fire and patient faithfulness in the face of injustice and suffering.</p>
<h2 id="heres-the-thing-though-im-worried-about-the-other-members-of-the-cedarville-diaspora">Here’s the thing, though: I’m worried about the other members of the “Cedarville Diaspora.”</h2>
<p>“Cedarville ex-pats”? Take your pick of terms.</p>
<p>No, not so much the professors who were pushed out. They’ve miraculously landed on their feet, and I’ve witnessed God’s powerful work of redemption through them in their current careers and ministries.</p>
<p>No, I’m talking about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>alumni</strong></em></span> who got burned by fundamentalism and may have already <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/08/on-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater-a-message-for-abused-ex-fundamentalists/">thrown out the Christian baby with the fundamentalist bathwater</a>. Or perhaps they’re seriously considering doing so.</p>
<p>See, God has blessed me with a wonderful seminary and church community in which to grow and heal after Cedarville. Without those things, I don’t know where I’d be after the awful ending to my Christian college experience.</p>
<p>Others, however, may be feeling very <strong>lonely</strong> and <strong>angry</strong> right now.</p>
<p><strong>If that’s you, or if you know someone to whom this applies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would you let me know if there’s any way I can help you</span>?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll gladly listen to you vent. I’d love to pray for you specifically, and perhaps to share what I’ve found helpful along the journey.</p>

      <title>How Do You Want To Be Remembered?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know what the worst thing about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;dying&lt;/span&gt; itself – its the &lt;strong&gt;separation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, we don’t suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sad reality, to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-if-however-we-could-use-death-to-our-own-advantage&#34;&gt;What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 –&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know what the worst thing about <em><strong>death</strong></em> is?</p>
<p>It’s not the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dying</span> itself – its the <strong>separation</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, we don’t suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.</p>
<p>A sad reality, to be sure.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-however-we-could-use-death-to-our-own-advantage">What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage?</h3>
<p>I’m convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 –</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Eccl-7-2" id="en-NIV-17432">It is better to go to a house of mourning</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">than to go to a house of feasting,</span></span><br>
<span class="text Eccl-7-2">for death is the destiny of everyone;</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">the living should take this to heart.</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, obviously, simply taking death to heart isn’t enough to defeat our most ancient enemy. For that, we need (and have been given) a <em><strong>resurrection</strong></em>.</p>
<p>But, have you taken your own death to heart? I believe there’s something to be gained by considering how you’d like to be remembered by others after you die.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-want-to-be-remembered">How do you want to be remembered:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="by-god">by God?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-spouse">by your spouse?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-children">by your children?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-parents">by your parents?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-family-and-friends">by your family and friends?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-colleagues">by your colleagues?</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, I’d like to be remembered:</p>
<ul>
<li>…as God’s faithful servant.</li>
<li>…as my wife’s best friend.</li>
<li>…as my children’s most important teacher.</li>
<li>…as my parents’ legacy.</li>
<li>…as my family and friends’ loyal brother.</li>
<li>…as my colleagues inspiring teammate.</li>
</ul>
<p>…which sounds great, right? But here’s the rub:</p>
<h2 id="what-changes-do-you-and-i-need-to-make-in-our-lives-to-start-making-those-hypothetical-memories-more-realistic-each-day">What <span style="text-decoration: underline;">changes</span> do you and I need to make in our lives, to start making those hypothetical memories more realistic each day?</h2>
<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on this in the comments below, as I consider how taking death to heart should impact one’s entire life.</p>

      <title>What are you afraid of?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/what-are-you-afraid-of/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2016 20:02:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/what-are-you-afraid-of/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m scared. Are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, as I wrote in my journal this very morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m scared – I’m scared of wasting my life, I’m scared of not being worth anything outside of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear drives so many aspects of our lives – from how we dress, to how we raise our children, to how we elect our leaders. And, if we’re honest with ourselves, fear can play a large role in what/whom we worship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m scared. Are you?</p>
<p>Specifically, as I wrote in my journal this very morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m scared – I’m scared of wasting my life, I’m scared of not being worth anything outside of the classroom.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fear drives so many aspects of our lives – from how we dress, to how we raise our children, to how we elect our leaders. And, if we’re honest with ourselves, fear can play a large role in what/whom we worship.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps we worship God out of a fear of going to hell, or a fear of our inherited religion being wrong. We secretly worry that, like Donald Miller’s father accuses him in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1758575/quotes?item=qt1678309">Blue Like Jazz</a>, we “<em><strong>only believe that stuff ‘cuz [we]’re afraid to hang out with people that don’t</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Or perhaps we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don’t</span> worship God – and instead worship a god of our choice/invention – because we’re afraid of the implications of God’s existence.</p>
<p>Now, there is, I’m persuaded, a holy fear. A salutary reverence and awe in the face of the divine.</p>
<p>But that’s not what I’m talking about here, I’m talking about the <em><strong>paralyzing</strong></em> fear – the cold sweat, the white knuckles, the tension headaches.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the same kind of fear as <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/10/the-power-of-fear.html">Seth Godin</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-power-of-fear"><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/10/the-power-of-fear.html">The power of fear</a></h3>
<p>Fear will push you to avert your eyes.</p>
<p>Fear will make you think you have nothing to say.</p>
<p>It will create a buzz that makes it impossible to meditate…</p>
<p>or it will create a fog that makes it so you can do nothing but meditate.</p>
<p>Fear seduces us into losing our temper.</p>
<p>and fear belittles us into accepting unfairness.</p>
<p>Fear doesn’t like strangers, people who don’t look or act like us, and most of all, the unknown.</p>
<p>It causes us to carelessly make typos, or obsessively look for them.</p>
<p>Fear pushes us to fit in, so we won’t be noticed, but it also pushes us to rebel and to not be trustworthy, so we won’t be on the hook to produce.</p>
<p>It is subtle enough to trick us into thinking it isn’t pulling the strings, that it doesn’t exist, that it’s not the cause of, “I don’t feel like it.”</p>
<p>When in doubt, look for the fear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Courage isn’t the absence of fear. It’s knowing how to deal with fear. And, for me, <strong>the first step toward dealing with my fears is frankly admitting them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m scared, because I don’t know what’s next after I graduate from <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson</a> in December.</li>
<li>I’m scared, because the thing I’ve felt called to for the longest time – getting a PhD in systematic theology – seems like an impractical pipe dream.</li>
<li>I’m scared, because I don’t know if I’ll get into a PhD program. And, if I don’t, I don’t know how I’ll react to not being able to rely upon good grades for self-worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, none of these fears prevent me from being faithful with the day I’ve been given – today. <strong>The greatest failure would be to use fears of the future as an excuse for present faithlessness</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-are-you-afraid-of-how-are-you-dealing-with-those-fears">So, what are you afraid of? How are you dealing with those fears?</h3>
<h3 id="have-you-admitted-them-to-anyone-if-not-i-challenge-you-to-do-so-today">Have you admitted them to anyone? If not, I challenge you to do so today.</h3>
<p>If you’ve got no one, not even a journal, to listen to your admission, I’m all ears, for what it’s worth.</p>

      <title>Theology in Outline: What Do I Believe?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theology is confusing enough, much more so when you attempt to summarize it all in a single essay! Nevertheless, such was my assignment in seminary in 2015. Here are the results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“At the centre of Christian faith is the history of Christ. At the centre of the history of Christ is his passion and his death on the cross.” ~ Jürgen Moltmann&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;theology-in-outline-an-attempted-summary-of-the-christian-faith&#34;&gt;Theology in Outline: A[n Attempted] Summary of the Christian Faith&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that, during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, God died on a Roman cross.&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; We also believe that, the third day thereafter, Jesus of Nazareth – the same person who had been crucified – rose again from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Theology is confusing enough, much more so when you attempt to summarize it all in a single essay! Nevertheless, such was my assignment in seminary in 2015. Here are the results.</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At the centre of Christian faith is the history of Christ. At the centre of the history of Christ is his passion and his death on the cross.” ~ Jürgen Moltmann</em><a href="#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a></p></blockquote>
<h1 id="theology-in-outline-an-attempted-summary-of-the-christian-faith">Theology in Outline: A[n Attempted] Summary of the Christian Faith</h1>
<p>We believe that, during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, God died on a Roman cross.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> We also believe that, the third day thereafter, Jesus of Nazareth – the same person who had been crucified – rose again from the dead.</p>
<p>How can these things be?</p>
<p>How can the immortal, transcendent, omnipotent One come to a weak, immanent end?</p>
<p>How can a dead human leave his grave, living?</p>
<p>At this point, we face a crucial choice between:</p>
<ol>
<li>the posited “God” of metaphysical theism and</li>
<li>the revealed God of the Christian faith.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Should we choose the <em>former</em>, our Christ, canon, and confession are irreducibly <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>docetic</strong></em></span> – the true “God” is aloof, and merely play-acting, at best.</p>
<p>Yet, should we choose the <em>latter</em>, God is irreducibly, ineluctably Triune – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe, we <strong>trust</strong> that the Triune God is who God has revealed Godself to be.</p>
<h2 id="the-holy-trinity-the-main-characters-of-theology">THE HOLY TRINITY: The Main Character(s) of Theology</h2>
<p>The narrative of <strong>Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.”</strong><a href="#_ftn4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Andrej_Rubl%C3%ABv_001.jpg" alt="Icon of the Holy Trinity, the main character(s) in Christian theology"  />
</p>
<p>These three <em>dramatis personae Dei</em>, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a <em>persona</em> in Israel’s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.”<a href="#_ftn5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>YHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the <strong>Father</strong> by virtue of Jesus’ address of him as such.<a href="#_ftn6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a></li>
<li>The <strong>Son</strong> is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address.<a href="#_ftn7"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a></li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>Spirit</strong> appears as a <em>persona</em> of the story, first in the OT as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the NT as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church.<a href="#_ftn8"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, Jesus of Nazareth prayed to God, calling him Father. Yet this Son of God, confessed by Christians as “very God of very God” (Niceno-Constantinopolitan [Nicene] Creed), also cried out to the Father: “<strong>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</strong>” (Mark 15:34).</p>
<p>As Jenson rightly observes: “Therewith it becomes problematic that anything specified by listing ‘Father, Son, and Holy Spirit’ can be one God and not rather a mutually betraying pantheon.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>A simple solution to this problem of God’s unity would be to maintain that either <strong>just one</strong> (Subordinationism) or <strong>none</strong> (Modalism) of the three identities mentioned is <em>really</em> God. However, because the Church trusts Scripture as divine revelation, it believes that it knows the real God, whom it worships – delusion, according to Modalism. Furthermore, the Church worships all three divine Persons – idolatry, according to Subordinationism.</p>
<p><strong>We believe that we can truly know God in revelation, that God can give Godself to be known as an object, because God is first known by Godself – as Subject (Father), Object (Son), and Act of Revelation (Holy Spirit).<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></strong></p>
<p>In order to do justice to worship and the Word of God (or better, worship <em><u>of</u></em> the Word of God: Jesus), the Church confesses “that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed">Athanasian Creed</a>). One in three, three in one: Father, Son, and Spirit – each Person equally and essentially God, and yet each distinct from the other two.</p>
<p><strong>What about the “mutually betraying pantheon” revealed in Christ’s cry of dereliction?</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, the Spirit preserves God’s unity at the most frayed moment – maintaining the bond of love between the forsak<em>ing</em> Father and the forsak<em>en</em> Son, a love so powerful it conquered death.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> Through the power of the Holy Spirit, Christ is <em><strong>raised</strong></em> from the grave, <em><strong>revealed</strong></em> to be who he has always been: the Son of God (Rom. 1:4), and thereby <em><strong>restored</strong></em> to the Father.</p>
<p>The Trinity is one God, not three, because it is concerned with “a relationship between persons in which these persons constitute themselves in their relationship with each other.”<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> The doctrine of the Trinity holds together Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – as well as Crucifixion and Resurrection.</p>
<p>And yet, we are still faced with the difficulty of the Incarnation: <strong>how can the eternal God be so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">temporal</span>, the transcendent One so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immanent</span>?</strong></p>
<p>(For more on the Trinity, see my essay: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/">“The Holy Trinity: What Is It? (Why) Is It Important?”</a>)</p>
<h2 id="election--creation">ELECTION &amp; CREATION</h2>
<p>There is no escape from time, not even for God. The Trinity holds together not just Crucifixion and Resurrection, but time itself.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p>“<strong>Eternal</strong>” most properly means “without beginning, without end,” and not “<strong>timeless</strong>,” which means “without past, present, or future.”</p>
<p><strong>If we remove “timeless” from our definition of God’s eternality, the Trinity’s identification of itself with its temporal <em>opera ad extra</em> poses less of a theological threat (to divine transcendence), beginning with its first external work: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">election</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Or is it <strong>creation</strong>?</p>
<p>Barth is right to expose the dialectical relationship between the two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The creation of God, and therefore His positing of a reality distinct from Himself, is the external basis and possibility of the covenant. And the covenant itself is the internal basis and possibility of creation, and therefore of the existence of a reality distinct from God” (CD III/2, 204).</p></blockquote>
<p>The creaturely form and covenant content of the Triune God’s external works find their basis in the election of Jesus as the nexus of God and humanity – <strong>Christ is the electing God and the elected human, before the act of creation.</strong></p>
<p>That Jesus exists as the elect(ing) God-human before humanity itself exists – that <strong>he can precede himself, as it were</strong> – is but an illustration of <strong>the Triune God’s temporal transcendence, which is not threatened by (but rather displayed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through</span>) immanence.</strong></p>
<p>By, for, and to Jesus Christ “the universe is created as a theatre for God’s dealings with man and man’s dealings with God” (CD II/2, 94). Without a fully-orbed view of the Trinity, this extension outward from Godself to that which is not God, from Creator to creature, seems <strong>arbitrary</strong>. And yet, while God’s freedom can never be reduced to mere <span style="text-decoration: underline;">necessity</span>, the eternal love which characterizes the life of the Trinity makes God’s free decision to elect and create most <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>fitting</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Through Christ, there is a correspondence between the existence and love of God <em>ad intra</em> – between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – and the existence and love of God <em>ad extra</em> to humanity.</strong></p>
<p>Humanity only exists within this Christological correspondence, on the basis of a shared sphere with Christ.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> Therefore, “to be a man is to be with God,” for no matter what else each individual is, “he is on the basis of the fact that he is with Jesus and therefore with God” (CD III/2, 135). <strong>The Incarnation grounds anthropology in the Triune God’s address to humanity through Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<h2 id="reconciliation">RECONCILIATION</h2>
<p>However, the Incarnation also yields the clearest view of sin’s absurdity.</p>
<p><strong>Although the distinction between Creator and creation entails the <em>possibility</em> of creaturely conflict with God, it does not necessitate <em>actual sin</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Given the Christological and theological basis of human existence, <strong>it makes no sense</strong> for a human to actualize this possibility, for “if he denies God, he denies himself” and “chooses his own impossibility” (CD III/2, 136).</p>
<p>Just as there is no God behind God, there is no humanity beyond the divine summons, beyond existence in the same sphere inhabited by Christ. It is therefore unthinkable that humanity should try to be the source of its own existence, and yet this is precisely that which occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, sin is not merely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">moral</span> – it is both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ontological</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">incomprehensible</span></strong>: the inherent contradiction of a nothingness which opposes God as the very ground of all existence and reality.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-cross-and-the-empty-tomb">Back to the Cross and the Empty Tomb</h2>
<p>Pardon the cyclical nature of this discussion, but it is time to return to the Crucifixion and Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>Why did God the Father forsake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why was God the Son forsaken?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did the Spirit need to overcome the divine distancing?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to these questions begins with the eternal (before creation, but not timeless) election of Jesus Christ – for <strong>he is not just the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">electing</span> God and elected human, but also the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">damned</span> human and the damned God.</strong></p>
<p>Election is therefore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>double</strong></span>, in that (1) God elects unto <em><strong>Godself</strong></em>, through Jesus Christ, the incomprehensible nothingness – the terrible “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">No</span>” – that is the inevitable outworking of human sin. However, (2) God elects unto <em><strong>humanity</strong></em>, through Jesus Christ, the unmerited invitation – the wonderful “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yes</span>” – into the love and life of the Triune God.</p>
<p><strong>An eternal exchange. A “Yes” and a “No.”</strong></p>
<p>This is all beginning to sound rather <em>timeless</em>.</p>
<p>And yet, a proper appreciation of the <em><strong>timeliness</strong></em> of the Trinity is necessary to make sense of the divine revelation we have actually received, <strong>for the Bible contains but an account of the Trinity’s external works in the midst of time – first through the story of Israel, and then through the story of the Church.</strong><a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<h2 id="the-story-of-scripture">THE STORY OF SCRIPTURE:</h2>
<p>Between creation and the Incarnation lies the story of <strong>ISRAEL</strong>, lamentably overlooked in many formulations of the Christian faith.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Despite the invasion of <strong>SIN</strong> (Gen. 3) – which ruptured the perfect relationships between God and humanity, humanity and itself, and humanity and the rest of creation (with ontological implications, as mentioned above) – God does not abandon creation to its exile. Neither does God instantaneously fix things. Instead, <strong>God takes time.</strong></p>
<p>God calls Abraham and the nation of Israel back to unity with himself through <strong>COVENANT</strong>. He endeavors to pull them – and through them as a priestly nation, the world – back from the ruptured relationships into covenantal fellowship and oneness.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>However, the faithless Israelites repeatedly eschew the loving faithfulness of their God, leading to the <strong>EXILE</strong> of the nation.<a href="#_ftn18"><sup><sup>[18]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>In fulfillment of God’s eternal election, at the <strong>INCARNATION</strong>, the Trinity stretches through the Son to meet all humanity – as a Jewish man in the midst of Israel – in its state of partial exile, to fulfill the global mission of Israel.<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>As God enters our midst as Jesus Christ, he pushes us to the side in our perverted attempts to secure our own existence.<a href="#_ftn20"><sup><sup>[20]</sup></sup></a> Without succumbing to sin’s siren call, he is fully affected by it, bringing sinful human nature into the life of God and thereby intensifying the divine reaction against it into an ultimate tension.<a href="#_ftn21"><sup><sup>[21]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p><strong>The one ultimately worthy <em><u>to</u></em> exile is now also the one ultimately worthy <em><u>of</u></em> exile.</strong></p>
<p>Once more, to the <strong>CROSS</strong>. There, the Trinity stretches to the utmost, as the Son of God, worthy to mete out the sentence of exile, instead <em>goes into exile</em> – into the far country of the grave – bearing the consequences of sin for the sake of humanity’s salvation.<a href="#_ftn22"><sup><sup>[22]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Matthias_Gr%C3%BCnewald_-_The_Crucifixion_-_WGA10723.jpg/696px-Matthias_Gr%C3%BCnewald_-_The_Crucifixion_-_WGA10723.jpg" alt="depiction of the crucifixion, the crisis point of Christian theology"  />
</p>
<p><strong>At the death of Christ, the Trinity has stretched to its limit, and yet humanity is left in a state of partial exile as before.</strong></p>
<p>However, through the power of the Holy Spirit, the exiled Son of God is vindicated as the Savior of the world and brought back from the far country of death!</p>
<p>(For more on the Resurrection, see my sermon: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/03/29/son-of-man-can-your-bones-live/">“Son Of Man, Can Your Bones Live?”</a>)</p>
<p>Through this movement of the Son into the utmost exile and back again, <strong>sin itself is offered up to destruction</strong>.<a href="#_ftn23"><sup><sup>[23]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>And crucially, <strong>all humanity who is united to him by grace through faith – everyone who is therefore <em>in Christ</em> – gets caught up with the Son in his return to the life and love of the Triune God.</strong><a href="#_ftn24"><sup><sup>[24]</sup></sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-church">THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>And yet, getting caught up with Christ in this return to Triune fellowship does <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>not</strong></em></span> take place <strong>timelessly</strong> or <strong>instantaneously</strong>.</p>
<p>It is, rather, an <em><strong>already, not-yet</strong></em> phenomenon. Between the Resurrection and the present moment lies the ongoing (for about two millennia, now) story of the Church.</p>
<p>And while all Christians confess some sort of belief in the future return of Jesus to set things right, to “judge the living and the dead” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed">Apostles’ Creed</a>), it is a particular (though not unique) strength of <strong>Anglicanism</strong> that it <strong>endeavors to take seriously both the timeliness and diversity of the Trinity’s external work throughout the Church’s history</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically, since the Holy Spirit has been faithful to sustain the Church and supply it with leaders and teachers throughout its existence as a community “in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments,” timely works of the Trinity, if you will, “be duly ministered” (<a href="https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx">Articles of Religion</a>, 19), Anglicans feel free to draw upon the <strong>diverse breadth of thought throughout the history of Christ’s Body</strong>.</p>
<p><em>[For example, I do not expect to be reprimanded for drawing heavily upon Barth, Moltmann, and Jenson (non-Anglicans, all) throughout this paper!</em><a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a>]</p>
<p>On one hand, Anglicans believe that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>[i]t is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly like</strong>; for at all times they have been divers[e], and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men’s manners, so that nothing be ordained against God’s Word” (Articles of Religion, 34).</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Church history is not homogeneous, nor is it infallible.</strong></p>
<p>And yet, on the other hand, Anglicans are convinced that <strong>it is not <em>necessary</em> to jettison the great tradition(s) of the Church in order to achieve reform</strong>. Usually, one should only dispense with Church traditions that appear directly to contradict God’s Word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whosoever, through his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church…” (Articles of Religion, 34).</p></blockquote>
<p>The history of the “one, holy, catholic, and apostolic” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">Nicene Creed</a>) Church, despite its frequent descent into divided, profane, sectarian innovation, has <strong>great value</strong>.</p>
<p>Because it is a part of the history of the temporally-eternal, transcendently-immanent, Triune God – because it matters to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – <strong>the life and history of the Church ought to matter to all who call themselves Christians, Anglicans or not.</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(This post is about my late uncle, Timothy Steele. It’s long, and I swear toward the end. Sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is better to go to a funeral than a feast. For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart. Sorrow is better than laughter, because sober reflection is good for the heart.” (Ecclesiastes 7:2-3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition is staggering. The funeral of the man I most associate with laughter and joy. It hurts.

<h2 id="timothy-steele">Timothy Steele</h2>
<p>The juxtaposition is staggering. The funeral of the man I most associate with laughter and joy. It hurts. No Steele family gathering was complete without hearing his boisterous laugh, receiving one of his legendary bear hugs, and – if you were lucky – getting one heck of a sloppy kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>His greetings were the most genuine. I always knew when Uncle Tim had arrived. And whenever I arrived, he made me feel like my presence mattered, like he had missed me, like he was proud of me.</p>
<p>My Uncle Tim was one of the first people in the room to hold me when I was born. Although I can’t remember it, <em>he was there on the very first day of my life</em>. Growing up, his house was always a welcome place to hang out with my cousins. He was like a second dad, and his children like a second set of siblings.</p>
<p>Speaking of dad, my Uncle Tim was used by God to help my dad out of his habits and addictions and into an encounter with Jesus Christ. At the funeral, my dad spoke of it in terms of Tim saving him from drowning. <strong>I will perhaps never know how much in my life I owe to my Uncle Tim being there for his younger brother, Patrick, putting his reputation on the line to guide and love my dad toward Christ</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, it meant a lot to me that my Uncle Tim made it out to my wedding in Pennsylvania in August 2012. Whenever my wife and I watch our wedding video, one of our favorite parts is when Uncle Tim’s voice booms out from the back of the church after we finished our duet of <em>Be Thou My Vision</em>. Amidst the applause, he cries out in a weepy voice: <em><strong>“That was beautiful!!!”</strong></em> He is intertwined with the memories of one of the happiest days of my life.</p>
<p>Many more stories could be and have been told about Timothy Steele. However, there’s one memory in particular that I haven’t been able to get out of my head these past days since hearing of my uncle’s untimely death. It happened in the garage of Grandma Steele’s house during a family gathering when her health was declining, if I remember correctly. Amidst the normal hilarious and loud stories, the conversation took a serious turn, and my Uncle Tim spoke of the pain he felt when he looked back upon times in his life when he had turned his back on Jesus, so to speak.</p>
<p>Now, he didn’t speak of his regrets in terms of not knowing any better when he was younger. He didn’t speak of the pain of violating a general sense of right and wrong, but of the nagging sense that at various times he had let a <strong>person</strong> down…the person of Christ.</p>
<h2 id="encouragement-in-the-midst-of-pain">Encouragement in the Midst of Pain</h2>
<p>Here’s why I find that story encouraging in the midst of pain: <strong>You don’t much regret letting down people for whom you don’t much care. And even though we have all, to the very last one of us, let Jesus down, he never abandons us. His love makes my Uncle Tim’s love pale in comparison, and he is now showing Tim even more grace than Tim showed to all of us each day.</strong></p>
<p>If you ever met my Uncle Tim, you know of his gracious love toward every single person he met. These past few days have been filled with stories about this man who was a force of nature, always ready to extend his gregarious love toward even, if not especially, “discarded and used-up people,” as my cousin Whitney put it. And as my Uncle John put it, “<em><strong>Tim loved you like Jesus does.</strong></em>”</p>
<p>I was struck by viewing those loving, gracious memories of my Uncle Tim in light of the relationship revealed to me in that serious conversation in the garage. That is, to realize that my Uncle Tim was such a uniquely loving person, not just because he thought it was a good idea or because he just had so much love on his own, but because of the love he had received from Christ. To realize that <u>the intense love which characterized every personal encounter with my Uncle flowed from the intense love he had first and continually experienced in his personal encounter with the crucified-and-risen Jesus Christ</u>.</p>
<p>Unlike many, my Uncle Tim understood that the Gospel of Christ doesn’t just make a difference in the “afterlife,” but that it makes a difference in the here-and-now! That <em><strong>if knowing Christ makes no difference in how you treat the flesh-and-blood people around you who are made in God’s image, then you probably don’t know Christ</strong></em>. The eternal life spoken of in the Gospel doesn’t begin the day you die, it began the day Christ died and rose from the grave.</p>
<p>I often worry that Christian pronouncements about the good news of Jesus Christ strike others as hollow, fake, and escapist – especially in the context of a funeral. How can trite truisms about Jesus be relevant in the midst of so much pain?</p>
<p>But my Uncle Tim’s life on earth, painful ending and all, was not a trite truism. You know if you knew Timothy Steele. He demonstrated what <em><strong>faith</strong></em> looks like — that it has to do with more than just thinking the right things, more than just following a list of rules — it has to do with <u>a faithful relationship to a PERSON, a relationship which then changes the way you treat PEOPLE</u>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclude-and-reflect">Conclude and Reflect</h2>
<p>I write this reflection mid-air, on my way back to Alabama. I wish that I had gotten to see my family members in a house of merrymaking, but it was a house of mourning instead.As we remembered the life of the man who could make you laugh so hard you cried, there was a lot of laughter and a lot of tears in the Steele family this weekend. There was riotous applause at the funeral at one point, but I know there’s still a whole lot of sadness and pain.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this and you, like me, are privileged to have known Timothy Steele, would you reflect on the connection between the love this man showed to all and the love of Christ which he had first received? When you seek hope in the midst of your reasonable sorrow, and you spend time dwelling on happy memories of the man, would you consider that the source of all that gracious love wasn’t a general sense, it wasn’t an impersonal force…<u>it was my Uncle Tim’s encounter and relationship with a person</u>.</p>
<p>And if you’re reading this and your pain feels too great for all this Jesus talk at the moment, if, like me, you experienced a big dose of anger at the side of Tim’s casket this weekend…that God would allow this life to end so soon…that this world is still broken and infected by Death, would you please join me in clinging to the hope that <u>God hates death even more than we do</u>?</p>
<p>Sometimes it doesn’t feel like it, but seriously, he does. For all the hopeful Christian talk at funerals, we can never forget that Death <em>sucks</em>.</p>
<p>No, that’s not strong enough. <em><strong>Death is fucking horrible</strong></em>. And I hope you agree that I say that out of concern for accuracy, and not merely vulgarity.Death’s final defeat has been declared at the empty tomb of Jesus Christ, butdammit, we’re still waiting for the final removal of Death’s presence from this world. It’s not our annoying, normal friend. It’s our alien enemy. And I don’t know about you, but when Death strikes close to my door, when it hits the ones I love, I want to <strong>rage</strong> against it with all I have.</p>
<p><strong>God rages against Death. He dove headfirst into the depths of this world, into the realm of the discarded and the used-up, the dead and the dying. He himself dove into the very grave, that he might emerge from it victorious. That he might lay Death itself in its cold grave, that he might silence the bastard enemy of the children of God.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t just follow Jesus to get into heaven someday when I die. I follow him because he hates Death more than I do, because in an important sense he is more heartbroken than I am over the death of my Uncle and the sorrow of the family members he left behind. And because, amazingly enough, he invites me and his people — he invites YOU — to join him in the mission of eternal life, to join him in the process of putting Death to death in our daily lives, in the world around us.</p>
<p>And, following the words of my beloved Uncle Tim, <em><strong>that’s beautiful</strong></em>.</p>
<p>(For another reflection on death, hope, and resurrection, read <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/03/29/son-of-man-can-your-bones-live/">my sermon: “Son of Man, Can Your Bones Live?”</a>)</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just received the news today that my student paper submission for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lru.hobsonsradius.com/ssc/eform/N70x7m7aEx6G0x67128L.ssc&#34;&gt;2015 Southeast Regional Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society&lt;/a&gt; has been accepted!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just received the news today that my student paper submission for the <a href="https://lru.hobsonsradius.com/ssc/eform/N70x7m7aEx6G0x67128L.ssc">2015 Southeast Regional Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society</a> has been accepted!</p>
<p>My theme lately has been to write on <u>Karl Barth and the unity of the Church</u>. At last year&rsquo;s Regional ETS (hosted by my seminary, <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>), I presented an edited version of my undergraduate thesis: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/steele-southeast-ets-2014-paper-final-presesntation-edit.pdf">Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof: Atonement, Ecclesiology, and the Unity of God</a>. Click the link if you&rsquo;d like to read the PDF. Here&rsquo;s the thesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;This essay endeavors to demonstrate the theological and exegetical legitimacy of viewing <u>the atonement as the act in which the one God fulfills his creative purposes by bringing his uniqueness and simplicity to bear on our sinful, divisive condition through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah in order to save a people to robust unity with himself, each other, and the entire creation</u>.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>That paper was a blast to write, because I got to take the doctoral work of my professor (and friend) <a href="http://academics.biola.edu/torrey/about/people/faculty/adam-johnson/">Adam J. Johnson</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Being-Reconciliation-Theological-Systematic/dp/0567123456">God&rsquo;s Being in Reconciliation: The Theological Basis of the Unity and Diversity of the Atonement in the Theology of Karl Barth</a>, now available in paperback!) and &ldquo;build&rdquo; an atonement theory based upon the divine perfection of oneness/unity. I hope to expand on that work, drawing upon other theologians than Johnson and Barth, expanding my exegetical arguments for the atonement theory&rsquo;s legitimacy, considering practical implications for ecumenical efforts, etc.</p>
<p>This year, I have submitted a slightly edited version of my final paper fora seminar on the Theology of Karl Barth taught by Piotr Malysz last Fall at Beeson. The Barthian analogy is taking Barth&rsquo;s definition of sin as ontological impossibility — the impossible possibility — and transferring it to thought and speech about the Church. It&rsquo;s a relatively simple idea, with profound ramifications (in my humble opinion) for ecumenical efforts. Here&rsquo;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Just as sin is ontological impossibility, disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. The tension between the undeniable reality of sin and Karl Barth’s theological definition of sin as an impossible possibility parallels the tension between the obvious reality of a fractured church and the theological definition of the church as the one body of the one Christ. <u>In order to describe in Barthian terms what it means for church disunity to be possible only as sin is possible, the purpose of this paper is to correlate Barth’s anthropological concept of sin as ontological impossibility with its parallel ecclesiological concept: disunity as ecclesiological impossibility</u>. I then conclude by locating this discussion within Barth’s own ecumenical vision – with an eye toward informing and motivating further ecumenical efforts.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe this is an important topic to discuss because, as I put it, &ldquo;<em><strong>each community’s self-examination and pursuit of Christ’s unifying summons will only be as rigorous as its understanding of the absurdity of church fragmentation.</strong></em>&rdquo; That is, we&rsquo;re only going to put effort into being unified as Christ&rsquo;s Church if we have a robust understanding of just how ABSURD division is within the Body of Christ!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in this topic, but you can&rsquo;t make it to Lithonia, GA on March 27-28, feel free to read my paper here:</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my 20th Century History &amp;amp; Doctrine course at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m re-reading through &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth&#34;&gt;Karl Barth&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Evangelical-Theology-Introduction-Karl-Barth/dp/0802818196&#34;&gt;Evangelical Theology: An Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re involved in the life and ministry of the Church in any respect, I strongly recommend that you buy and read this book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a particularly challenging portion from the chapter on &amp;ldquo;Wonder,&amp;rdquo; beginning on page 71. I wish the language were gender-inclusive, but Karl&amp;rsquo;s words still ring true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After all, &lt;u&gt;who am I to be a theologian?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For my 20th Century History &amp; Doctrine course at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>, I&rsquo;m re-reading through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth">Karl Barth</a>&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evangelical-Theology-Introduction-Karl-Barth/dp/0802818196">Evangelical Theology: An Introduction</a></em>. If you&rsquo;re involved in the life and ministry of the Church in any respect, I strongly recommend that you buy and read this book!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a particularly challenging portion from the chapter on &ldquo;Wonder,&rdquo; beginning on page 71. I wish the language were gender-inclusive, but Karl&rsquo;s words still ring true:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After all, <u>who am I to be a theologian?</u></p>
<p>It does not matter whether I am the best child of the best parents, perhaps having known, like Timothy ( II Tim. 3:15), about the Holy Scriptures from the very time I began to think. It does not matter whether I have the cleverest mind or the most upright heart or the very best of intentions. <u>Who am I to have put such trust in myself as to devote myself even remotely to the task of theology</u>? Who am I to co-operate in this subject, at least potentially and perhaps quite actively, as a minor researcher, thinker, or teacher? Who am I to take up the quest for truth in the service and in the sense of the community, and to take pains to complete this quest?</p>
<p>I have put such trust in myself as soon as I touch theology with even my little finger, not to speak of occupying myself with it more or less energetically or perhaps even professionally. And if I have done that, I have without fail become concerned with <u>the new event and the miracle attested to by the Bible</u>.</p>
<p>This miracle involves far <u>more</u> than just the young man at Nain or the captain of Capernaum and their companions of whom the Gospelstell; far more than the Israelites&rsquo; passage through the Red Sea, the wilderness, and the Jordan; far more than the sun that stood still upon Joshua&rsquo;s command at Gibeon. <u>I have become involved in the<em>reality of God</em>that is only signaled by all these things</u>. This is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who reveals himself in his Son through the Holy Spirit, who desired to be the God of man so that man might live as<em>his</em>man.</p>
<p><u>I have become involved in the wonder of this God, together with all its consequences for the world and for each and every man. And whatever, however, and whoever I may be in other respects, I have finally and profoundly become a man made to wonder at himself by this wonder of God</u>.</p>
<p>It is another question whether I know what self-wonderment means for me, whether I am ready and able to subordinate my bit of research, thought, and speech to the logic of this wonder (and not in reverse order!). But <u>there can be no question about one fact: I find myself confronted by the wondrous reality of the living<em>God</em>. This confrontation occurs in even the most timid and untalented attempt to take seriously the subject in which I have become involved or to work theologically at all, whether in the field of exegesis, Church history, dogmatics, or ethics</u>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Words fail.</p>
<p>Cedarville, get your act together. Prospective students, stay far away until the institution recovers it’s broad evangelical vision (the one carried forward by Bill Brown and Carl Ruby, for example). Unfortunately, it appears that vision has been thoroughly squashed in the conservative takeover.</p>

      <title>Concerning Romans</title>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/&#34;&gt;concerned the chaos at Cedarville University&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;my shameful alma mater&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets&#34;&gt;2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow (see&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/07/my-regional-ets-presentation-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/&#34;&gt; my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, and come to my presentation at &lt;strong&gt;5:00pm in room S009!&lt;/strong&gt;), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/">concerned the chaos at Cedarville University</a>!</p>
<p>However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">my shameful alma mater</a> at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets">2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS</a> tomorrow (see<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/07/my-regional-ets-presentation-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/"> my previous post</a>, and come to my presentation at <strong>5:00pm in room S009!</strong>), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, given the current discussion in my New Testament Theology — two classes on Romans — I thought I might re-post two of my previous works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/06/28/romans-revisited-pt-1/">Romans. Revisited.</a> (or <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/05/03/the-argument-story-of-romans/">“The Argument-Story of Romans”</a>):</strong> my final write-up for Dr. Chris Miller’s course on Romans and Galatians at Cedarville University. We were due to have an oral exam on the last day of class, in which we talked-through the logic of the epistle. I wrote this summary the night before the exam, and was given the opportunity to present it to the class. I now present it to you! Feel free to give me some push-back!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/romans-13/">Romans 13:1-7 — A Contextually-Appropriate Reading</a>:</strong> a paper I wrote for the same course as mentioned above, in which I defend the following thesis: <strong>“Far from being a comprehensive condensation of the apostle’s beliefs regarding any and all governments past and present, [Romans 13:1-7] is a specific and historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, discouraging them from political unrest, disobedience, and rebellion in order to protect their testimony and the effectiveness of the Roman church in the gospel mission.”</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all for now. Grace and Peace.</p>

I wish I could say I was proud of my alma mater…</p>
<p>Despite my Lenten Facebook fast, I was made aware of <strong>the following post</strong> by my friend <a href="http://marlenagraves.com/"><strong>Marlena Graves</strong></a>. I thought I’d share it, just in case anyone is considering Cedarville as a choice for college. I’d still strongly recommend you attend another institution, where you can trust the administration. My <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/">previous thoughts</a> on<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/02/19/oh-cedarville/"> these matters</a> still <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">stand</a>.</p>
<p>======</p>
<p>“Dear friends,</p>
<p>“Every. Single. Week. I am contacted by people who attend and work at CU who are just miserable. I pray about what to say and what not to say; my motives aren’t malicious. This morning I was reading about Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and how he couldn’t believe that the Christians in Germany remained silent about Hitler or actively conspired with Hitler to get rid of the Jews. This situation at CU is no Germany. But faculty and staff at the school I loved are now forced into silence. They’re being oppressed. If they speak, they’ll lose their jobs. Their FB accounts and e-mails are monitored. A coup occurred at CU as it did at Southern Seminary, Southwestern Seminary, and Southeastern Seminary at the hands of Paige Patterson. Paige Patterson is now a trustee and mentor to the new president, Dr. White. Many who made decisions who fought to keep us and our friends (Bible profs/Carl Ruby and others) at the school told us that it was a coup. So the current administration doesn’t care about what fac/staff think. And students are there temporarily so….The chair of the board has said that he is willing to take the school down to 1200 to get their way. Shawn and I can afford to speak up because we didn’t sign a non-disclosure agreement. We are thriving and not bitter. But, I do get angry about how people are being treated. Thank God Shawn got a job right away and didn’t have to worry about providing for his family. Every single person who knows me will tell you I deliberate about my words. I am tired of the pain people are going through. And so I speak up because I can. I think this is the last chance for those currently there to give an outcry. Otherwise it’s over for them. They have moved to forbid egalitarians from teaching there, too. Next year, if you cannot say you are comp, you cannot work there. Only money and power can accomplish such a coup. I have no money or power. But, I have the freedom to speak up. So this below is just more evidence of what is going on. Students pray for your professors and staff. Many are suffering and can’t even tell you. Many of their jobs are on the line. They continue to clean house while silencing people. Pay attention to who is no longer there and from where they hire their new faculty. I’ve lost count of who is gone. People have to decide whether or not they’ll feed their families or speak up. So please, speak up on their behalf!</p>
<p>“Take a look at the fall course schedule. The new female Bible prof’s classes are limited to female students only:<a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/courses/schedule/2014fa_bi_beth.htm">http://www.cedarville.edu/courses/schedule/2014fa_bi_beth.htm</a>. Even under Dr. Dixon, that was never the case for Jean Fisher’s classes.”</p>

&lt;/a&gt;I’m happy to announce that Rachel and I will be completing my required &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/cross-culturalministrypracticums&#34;&gt;Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt; along with our good friends Kyle, Rebekah, and baby Luke DeBoer in Lima, Peru this summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to assist &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abweperu.org/page_family/pagefamily.php?id=12&#34;&gt;the Stone families&lt;/a&gt; (Dave &amp;amp; Evelyn; Jonathan &amp;amp; Angela) in their various local ministries, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stblima.org/&#34;&gt;Seminario Teológico Bautista&lt;/a&gt; (Seminary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://luzdelcaminosb.wix.com/luzdelcamino/&#34;&gt;Luz del Camino Iglesia&lt;/a&gt; (Church)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centroprenatal.org/&#34;&gt;Vida Nueva Centro Prenatal&lt;/a&gt; (Pregnancy Center)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Beeson’s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to “&lt;em&gt;expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting&lt;/em&gt;.” In addition to fulfilling this goal, we believe that this trip to Peru will be &lt;strong&gt;influential in determining the future involvement of both our families in global missions&lt;/strong&gt;. God’s given each of us unique gifts — ranging from medicine to math, theology to linguistics. But &lt;strong&gt;He’s blessed us all with a heart for His global Gospel and his global Church&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rachel and I are in the middle of our second month of calling Birmingham, Alabama “home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could both do with a little less humidity (!), we’re enjoying ourselves and our surroundings down here in Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-happening-in-birmingham-al&#34;&gt;What’s Happening in Birmingham, AL:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t start my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/masterofdivinity&#34;&gt;M.Div.&lt;/a&gt; coursework at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt; until late August, but I’ve already started working at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/mediacenter&#34;&gt;Beeson’s Media Center&lt;/a&gt; (follow our nascent &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeesonMedia&#34;&gt;Twitter account here&lt;/a&gt;). It’s an incredibly convenient on-campus job. I’m already thankful for the hospitality of my boss and coworkers. It’s helpful as I learn the ropes of AV, IT, and sundry other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rachel and I are in the middle of our second month of calling Birmingham, Alabama “home.”</p>
<p>While we could both do with a little less humidity (!), we’re enjoying ourselves and our surroundings down here in Alabama.</p>
<h2 id="whats-happening-in-birmingham-al">What’s Happening in Birmingham, AL:</h2>
<p>I don’t start my <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/masterofdivinity">M.Div.</a> coursework at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a> until late August, but I’ve already started working at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/mediacenter">Beeson’s Media Center</a> (follow our nascent <a href="https://twitter.com/BeesonMedia">Twitter account here</a>). It’s an incredibly convenient on-campus job. I’m already thankful for the hospitality of my boss and coworkers. It’s helpful as I learn the ropes of AV, IT, and sundry other tasks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547848412"><img loading="lazy" src="http://indiereader.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/life-of-pi.jpg" alt=""  />
</a>Before diving into my required reading for the Fall, I’ve been working my way through a few books so far this summer. On the fiction side of things, I heartily recommend <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547848412">Life of Pi</a></em> by Yann Martel.</p>
<p>Even more so, however, I strongly recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/pennerm">Myron Bradley Penner</a>‘s <em><a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/the-end-of-apologetics/285611">The End of Apologetics: Christian Witness in a Postmodern Context</a></em> to anyone and everyone interested in philosophy, religion, and theology. I plan on devoting a series of posts to a discussion of Penner’s work. For now, suffice it to say the following: This book has already been a godsend in my contemplation of how best to advance God’s Kingdom. (Academically, pastorally, and globally, as I’d say.) Especially in the midst of postmodernity.</p>
<p><a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/the-end-of-apologetics/285611"><img loading="lazy" src="http://assets.bakerpublishinggroup.com/processed/books/covers/original/9781441251091.jpg?1372396212" alt=""  />
</a>Again, I’ll have more to say about Penner’s book in later posts, but to whet your appetite, allow me to point you toward Peter Enns’ interview with Penner: “<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/06/is-christian-apologetics-secular-and-unbiblical-an-interview-with-myron-penner/">Is Christian Apologetics Secular and Unbiblical?</a>” Also, Sarah Jones’ post, “<a href="http://anthonybsusan.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/tony-jones-and-the-need-for-a-postcolonial-christianity/">Tony Jones and the Need for a Postcolonial Christianity</a>” came to mind several times while reading <em>The End of Apologetics</em>. Definitely worth a read!</p>
<p>Finally, my current project is reading <a href="http://www.nai.uu.se/research/researchers/terje-oestigaard/">Terje Oestigaard’s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Water-Christianity-Capitalism-Terje-Oestigaard/dp/1780760663"><em>Water, Christianity and the Rise of Capitalism</em></a> to review for<a href="http://www.hope.ac.uk/theologicalbookreview/"> Liverpool Hope University’s <em>Theological Book Review</em></a>. It’s definitely further away from my comfort zone than the <a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/from-paradise-to-the-promised-land-3rd-edition/230932">Pentateuch textbook</a> I’ve reviewed previously, but hey, I’m trying to branch out. Stay tuned for my feedback.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>(Originally posted in <a href="http://www.theventriloquist.us/">The Ventriloquist</a>. Go check out the rest of <a href="http://www.theventriloquist.us/">Issue 10</a>!)</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“A Farewell to Cedarville” – Joshua Steele</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>As what was once a vision for the future has become an agenda for returning to the past, the list of people who no longer fit the Cedarville mold is growing.</strong> I contacted former vice president of Student Life, Dr. <a href="http://www.carlruby.com/">Carl Ruby</a>; former professor Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelpahl/">Michael Pahl</a>; current professors Dr. TC Ham, Dr. Shawn Graves, and Dr. David Mills; and former trustees Dr. William Rudd and Rev. Chris Williamson to see where things stand as this academic year comes to a close.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Ruby does not know what the long term future holds, he is pouring himself into immigration reform. When asked about his plans, he replied: “I’m motivated by an experience that I had on the Civil Rights bus tour in Birmingham, Alabama. As I read King’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail, I determined that I didn’t want to be on the wrong side of history, or more important, on the wrong side of the gospel on these kinds of issues. I leave Cedarville with lots of good memories and a clear conscience. I hope I invested my time and energy in the things that mattered most … loving God and loving people.”</p>
<p>And speaking of immigrants, Dr. Pahl moved his family nearly 2,000 miles as the crow flies from Alberta, Canada to Cedarville, Ohio in 2011. However, after just two semesters, the “promising scholar” and “dedicated teacher” was fired for his inability <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/documents-2/the-dismissal-of-dr-pahl/">“to concur fully with each and every position of Cedarville University’s doctrinal statement.”</a> The Pahls have spent the year trying to move on – looking for work, and working on renovations to sell the old parsonage which they bought less than three months before receiving notice of Dr. Pahl’s “review.”</p>
<p>It would be one thing if the Pahls were victims of a broken immigration system. It seems, however, that they are victims of a broken institution which claims the name of Christ.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Ruby and Dr. Pahl had little say regarding their terminations, others are voluntarily choosing to disassociate from the University.</p>
<p>Prompted by the changing Cedarville climate, Dr. Ham will be making the move to Canton, OH this summer to teach at <a href="http://www.malone.edu/">Malone University</a>. “I should note that I am not being forced to resign. I am leaving voluntarily,” Dr. Ham clarified. “However, I would not have been seeking other ministry opportunities had the past two years been different. For me, it was the events surrounding the termination of my good friend Michael Pahl that prompted me to look elsewhere. Other recent events—mostly known to the student body, but some unknown to them—have served to solidify my decision. While I am very excited about my future ministry, it is with profound sadness that I leave the wonderful men and women I’ve known as colleagues here.”</p>
<p>After the elimination of the philosophy major, Dr. Graves was offered a terminal contract. However, he has instead accepted a tenure track position at the <a href="http://www.findlay.edu/Pages/default.aspx">University of Findlay</a>, where he will begin teaching this fall. His wife, <a href="http://marlenagraves.com/">Marlena Graves</a>, will conclude her role as the Resident Director of Murphy Hall at the end of this semester.</p>
<p>Dr. Mills, if he is at Cedarville next year, will have to carry the course load for the remaining philosophy minor in Dr. Graves’ absence. Dr. Mills declined the option to drastically expand the Honors Program during the 2013-14 school year before handing it over to an unknown successor, and was therefore removed from his involvement in the program, effective at the end of this semester.</p>
<p>The voluntary disassociations are not limited to faculty and staff, but also include trustees. Recent changes in the Board have included the resignations of <a href="http://calvarymuskegon.com/#/about-calvary/our-ministry-team">Dr. Rudd</a> and <a href="http://www.strongtowerbiblechurch.com/#/our-team">Rev. Williamson</a>, two proponents of the same concerns held by student advocates such as myself.</p>
<p>Dr. Rudd, who served as a Cedarville trustee for over 20 years, including multiple terms as Board Chairman, had the following to say regarding his resignation:</p>
<p>“I’m very thankful for CU and the privilege of being very closely associated with it for so many years. I have many dear friends there who are amazing servants of God. It saddens me deeply that I could no longer support actions and direction of the current leadership and that I was no longer able to exert influence for what I believe to be truthfulness, integrity, and Biblical consistency. God has graciously blessed Cedarville and there are many, many wonderful people still associated with it. I pray that the leadership will be restored to Biblical integrity.”</p>
<p>In Rev. Williamson’s words: “The board of trustees repeatedly mishandled God’s servants while virtually ignoring the cries of students and alumni alike. Any hint of due process was abandoned, and the ability to have respectful dialogues on key issues was non-existent. I resigned because I could no longer be associated with a group that was constantly untruthful and unjust.”</p>
<p><strong>And so the Cedarville diaspora grows</strong>. If this university is going to inspire true greatness, it should avoid driving away godly individuals like Ruby, Pahl, Ham, Graves, Mills, Williamson, and Rudd in the future.</p>
<p>Some may accuse me of biting the hand that feeds. But it is not the same hand.</p>
<p>I have been fed by Carl Ruby’s Cedarville, not the new Cedarville of twenty years ago. As the University hearkens back to the glory days before creeping “liberalism” reached the bubble’s border, the leadership has responded to repeated requests for clarity and honesty with poignant silences and disappointing distortions of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>God is not surprised. I wonder if he is angered, though, by having his knowledge and sovereignty used to justify injustice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cedarville, fulfill your call and be true to our God – not by claiming institutional prerogatives to drive away our Christlike best – but by doing justice, promoting honesty, and walking humbly with Him whose name we claim.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Update</em>:</strong></span> <em>Dr. Carl B. Smith, Professor of Church History, has willfully decided to turn in an unsigned contract. Although he does not have further employment lined up at this time, he will not be returning to Cedarville for the 2013-14 academic year.</em></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yahweh and others have been too good to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I received two awards at Cedarville University’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/cf/calendar/viewsingleevent/id/b30deaf6-2481-ade4-b080-a503cd1527b2&#34;&gt;49th Annual Academic Honors Day Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The scholarship assists a graduating full-time male senior student who has been accepted by a conservative evangelical seminary. The recipient must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3, demonstrate the spiritual qualifications and godly leadership skills necessary to excel in this ministry, and plan to serve as full-time pastor of a church. […] The Department of Biblical and Ministry Studies faculty select the recipients.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The recipient must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3, demonstrate the spiritual qualifications and godly leadership skills necessary to excel in this ministry, and plan to serve as full-time pastor of a church. […] The Department of Biblical and Ministry Studies faculty select the recipients.”</p>

</p>
<p>The first award got me a copy of <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Bibles/ParallelTextBibles/NewInternationalVersion/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5NTI4MTM2MQ==">The Contemporary Parallel New Testament</a> (edited by Kohlenberger, III). The second award? $5,000 toward my seminary education. Barring any significant price hikes, that should cover the remainder of my tuition at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a> for the next 3.5 years!</p>
<p>Despite my standing critiques of Cedarville University, I must admit that my life would look radically different today had I not arrived here four years ago.</p>

</p>
<p>As I look forward to the next stage of my life, I’m realizing more and more how much my life each day depends on the grace and generosity of others. I’m extremely thankful for the opportunities – even the painful ones – I’ve been given to live, learn, and grow at Cedarville. I never would have imagined meeting so many <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelpahl/">wonderful</a>, <a href="http://www.carlruby.com/">Christlike</a>, and challenging people in the middle of cornfields in Southwest Ohio.</p>
<p>I’m thankful that God’s Kingdom transcends Cedarville,<br>
but also that I’ve gotten to glimpse the Kingdom here.</p>
<p>Grace and Peace,</p>
<p>~Josh</p>

      <title>On Building/Burning Bridges</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: there’s a fair bit about the Church that frustrates me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’d like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I’d like first to aim them at myself. After all, if I want to witness self-righteous pride, xenophobia, misplaced anger, etc., I need look no further than the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DISCLAIMER: there’s a fair bit about the Church that frustrates me.</p>
<p>However, I’d like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.</p>
<p>Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I’d like first to aim them at myself. After all, if I want to witness self-righteous pride, xenophobia, misplaced anger, etc., I need look no further than the mirror.</p>
<p>However, building bridges (much less walking across them and back unscathed) can be quite difficult in our post-/hyper-modern day. Each post I pass along (usually via Facebook and Twitter, but also here on the blog), thinking it interesting/challenging/inspiring, can generate everything from cheers to tears, it can bring life and also offend. This isn’t a bad thing. In fact, I’d argue that it’s good and necessary to be both inspired and angered by certain things.</p>
<p>…but it can make things quite complicated and messy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’m more worried about returning from the other side of the bridge *unchanged* than unscathed. But if I’m going to be successful, I need your help.</p>
<p>For one thing, I need your charity. No, not monetary charity (at least not now!), but for you, all of you, to be charitable readers. I don’t have enough time to explain fully my thoughts on and interpretation of every link/article that I post. Frequently, I do agree in some way with the author(s) of those links, but I would almost never be willing to sign off on each and every thing they say. Look for the good and true in each posted thing, and join me in thinking through what these authors have to say. That’s usually the goal of most of my postings: to get people to think.</p>
<p>Second, if something I’ve posted or said has caused a deep rift between you and me – a rift which probably goes deeper than a superficial misunderstanding – feel free to contact me and we can try to clear things up. I can’t guarantee that we’ll see eye-to-eye on things, and we might even have a sharper disagreement as a result, but I’d like to always value people more than I value positions, relationships more than reasons.</p>
<p>Both sides in most debates have at least one thing to learn from their opponents. Give me a chance to learn from you – if not to change my opinions, at least so that I can sincerely hold my own differing opinions.</p>
<p>After all, disagreeing with a bunch of straw men is no good at all. Meaningful arguments have faces.</p>

      <title>Let There Be Light: My Resignation</title>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/let-there-be-light-my-resignation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Please read:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/leadership-transfer-2/&#34;&gt;Let There Be Light – Leadership Transfer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until further notice, I hereby rescind my use of the Let There Be Light platform&lt;/strong&gt; (including &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/fiatlux125&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fiatlux125&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;to protest recent changes at Cedarville University.&lt;/strong&gt; The LTBL platform will now be &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;exclusively alumni-run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and I encourage everyone interested in developments at the University to follow their posts and make subsequent judgments regarding Cedarville’s identity and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal in all of this is &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to honor my Messiah by following him well and furthering his Kingdom with justice, unity, and true peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>**Please read:</strong></em> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong><a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/leadership-transfer-2/">Let There Be Light – Leadership Transfer</a></strong></em></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>**</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Until further notice, I hereby rescind my use of the Let There Be Light platform</strong> (including <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fiatlux125">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fiatlux125">Twitter</a>) <strong>to protest recent changes at Cedarville University.</strong> The LTBL platform will now be <em><strong>exclusively alumni-run</strong></em>, and I encourage everyone interested in developments at the University to follow their posts and make subsequent judgments regarding Cedarville’s identity and vision.</p>
<p>My goal in all of this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>to honor my Messiah by following him well and furthering his Kingdom with justice, unity, and true peace.</strong></span></p>
<p>Let it be known that <strong>I am bitterly disappointed with the direction in which Cedarville University is currently heading.</strong> Unless its leaders frankly and forthrightly admit their agenda for the future and their recent decisions including the firing of Dr. Carl Ruby, I cannot in good conscience recommend Cedarville to any prospective students. If CU leaders are willing to get rid of people like Dr. Ruby and yet unwilling to admit that they’ve done so, that’s not just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">disingenuous</span> – it’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;">dangerous</span>.</p>
<p>I also cannot recommend a place which holds un-scholarly documents as <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">the White Papers</a> as official explanations of its doctrinal stances. I cannot recommend a place where people like Dr. Michael Pahl are not allowed to teach, and where good evangelicals are “reviewed” by ad hoc doctrinal panels. I cannot recommend a place where my mentors are harassed for being forthright with their students. If <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/poignant-revealing-words/">Bob Gresh’s words are true and men like Mr. Scharnberg want to return Cedarville University to the “real Cedarville” of 19 years ago</a>, I cannot support such a move. That’s not the Cedarville I’ve known and loved.</p>
<p><strong>My resignation from <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">Let There Be Light</a> does not change these personal opinions</strong>. However, I do pray that Cedarville might change and thrive, so that one day I can gladly and sincerely recommend it once more.</p>
<p>I will continue to use my own personal social media outlets to express my views freely and openly. For now, as a current student of Cedarville University, I will content myself with asking questions, trying to make sense of all this, and encouraging the members of the CU community who have had the biggest impact on my life.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">With people like Carl Ruby, Chris Williamson, and Bill Rudd gone, we’re quickly losing leaders at Cedarville who will advocate for these types of concerns.</span></strong> I’m therefore convinced that my time left at Cedarville will be better spent on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">encouragement</span> than <span style="text-decoration:underline;">advocacy</span>. Although I am unsatisfied with the recent decisions and direction of my University, there are still many good and godly women and men here whom I’d like to uplift and affirm before I graduate.</p>
<p>Although I will no longer be a contributing member of Let There Be Light, I ask you to join with me in always calling for transparency and justice within our respective communities. The justice-filled Kingdom of God is being built one context, one community at a time, all over the world.</p>
<p>I do not regret founding <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">Let There Be Light</a>, nor do I regret my efforts to make Cedarville a more just community by striking a prophetic pose as a student with relatively little to lose. I’ve not done it perfectly (see my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/02/22/open-apology/" title="Open Apology">Open Apology</a>), but speaking truth to power will always be necessary.</p>
<p>Our God is a god of justice, peace, and unity. There can be no true unity or peace without justice.</p>
<p><em><strong>He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>And what does the Lord require of you?</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>To act justly and to love mercy</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>and to walk humbly with your God.</strong></em></p>
<p>Grace and Peace,</p>
<p>Joshua Steele</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To whomever the following concerns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d like to apologize publicly to any persons I may have offended during the past few months of my student activism efforts at Cedarville University.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, I recognize that some of my statements/claims about the perceived injustices at my University have seemed quite shocking, especially without further context. So I apologize for the times when I put pithiness before precision and unwittingly ostracized many good people whom I was not intending to criticize at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To whomever the following concerns:</p>
<p><strong>I’d like to apologize publicly to any persons I may have offended during the past few months of my student activism efforts at Cedarville University.</strong></p>
<p>After all, I recognize that some of my statements/claims about the perceived injustices at my University have seemed quite shocking, especially without further context. So I apologize for the times when I put pithiness before precision and unwittingly ostracized many good people whom I was not intending to criticize at all.</p>
<p>Many times my frustration – directed at the nebulous group of trustees and administrators most directly responsible for things like the White Papers, the firing of Michael Pahl, and the firing of Carl Ruby – has seeped over and negatively affected some of the good people I’d like to defend and advocate for, if it were their necks on the chopping block.</p>
<p>There are MANY great people at Cedarville University in between those who’ve been fired and those who’ve made the firing decisions, and I don’t want to overlook them or accidentally attack them. If you’re a member of that group and you’ve been put-off by my recent words and actions, I truly am sorry. Please forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>I’d also like to apologize publicly for any embarrassment I’ve caused to the Kingdom of God in this process.</strong></p>
<p>That is, while I’m NOT sorry for seeking prophetically to address injustices being committed by the people of God against the people of God, I AM sorry if I’ve given the impression to those on the outside looking in that this is how Christianity always goes.</p>
<p>(This is not a retraction of my activism efforts, for I am sincerely convinced that the University has committed institutional sins, if you will, in its recent decisions.)</p>
<p>However, I would like to remind all “outsiders” that following Jesus of Nazareth is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>not</strong> </span>supposed to look like the current controversies which plague Cedarville University. Christianity is more than just intrigue and infighting, although those things will always be a part of Christendom until the end of days because us Christians are messed-up people just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Would you <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>please forgive me, and please forgive us Christians, for doing a poor job of representing Yahweh to you?</strong> </span></p>
<p>He is a God of unity, justice, and peace, and yet far too often we, as his people, miserably fail at embodying those things.</p>
<p>In the end, Yahweh has told us human beings what is good: to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. (Micah 6:8.)</p>
<p>Justice, mercy, and humility.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for when I’ve failed to embody <span style="text-decoration:underline;">mercy</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">humility</span> in my pursuit of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">justice</span>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Joshua Steele</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been extremely frustrated with someone/thing you love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s been my experience during my final year here at Cedarville University. See, &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/&#34;&gt;I love this place.&lt;/a&gt; And that’s why I can’t stand it sometimes. There are still so many good and godly women and men here, so much potential for God’s Kingdom. And that’s why recent decisions made by Cedarville Admins and Trustees are so heartbreaking. &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/&#34; title=&#34;Open Letter to Cedarville Admins and Trustees&#34;&gt;I’ve written about this before&lt;/a&gt; (Open Letter).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been extremely frustrated with someone/thing you love?</p>
<p>That’s been my experience during my final year here at Cedarville University. See, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/">I love this place.</a> And that’s why I can’t stand it sometimes. There are still so many good and godly women and men here, so much potential for God’s Kingdom. And that’s why recent decisions made by Cedarville Admins and Trustees are so heartbreaking. <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/" title="Open Letter to Cedarville Admins and Trustees">I’ve written about this before</a> (Open Letter).</p>
<p>The sources of my angst? I’ll give you the top three from my growing list of concerns.</p>
<h2 id="the-white-papers">The White Papers<img loading="lazy" src="http://www.callcentrehelper.com/images/stories/2010/white_papers.gif" alt=""  />
</h2>
<p>I found out about these a year ago, when I had no idea of the storm that was brewing. I won’t spend time repeating what’s already been well said about the Papers <a href="http://theventriloquist.us/article/whats_wrong_with_white_papers">here </a>and <a href="http://www.mulberrycommunity.com/2012/10/is-that-so-cedarville.html">here</a>, but suffice it to say that if I turned in a White Paper as an undergraduate theological essay, I’d be getting a C- and a talk from my professor for my sub-par work. It’s patently obvious that Bib/Theo scholars were NOT consulted in the composition of these documents. Or, if they were, they were summarily ignored. And CU is making PhDs in Bib/Theo studies sign these things! Despicable.</p>
<p>This seems like a shameful attempt of reigning in the “creeping liberalism” of Cedarville’s Bible department. First, if you know any of the conservative evangelical CU Bible faculty, you’ll realize that this is some sort of sick joke. Second, at least proofread your documents to the standards of good scholarship! Even if I agreed with the White Papers’ attempts to silence debate and discussion on matters related to creation, justification, and omniscience, I would still be ashamed of their poor quality.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read Cedarville’s White Papers, they can <em>finally</em> be found <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">here</a> (to the right), on the University website. We had to petition and then wait <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>a couple months</strong></span> before the Administration publicly posted the White Papers, even though they are supposed to describe the University’s <em><strong>official position</strong></em> on three important areas of doctrine!!! Did Cedarville ever intend on releasing these documents if students hadn’t petitioned Dr. Gredy and Dr. Cornman? Or were the White Papers just supposed to be a secret weapon to cleanse the Bible faculty? Apparently they were important enough to be used in the firing of Dr. Michael Pahl.</p>
<h2 id="michael-pahl">Michael Pahl<img loading="lazy" src="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Images/Campus-News/News/2011/Michael-Pahl.jpg" alt=""  />
</h2>
<p>Dr. Pahl was hired before the 2011-12 school year. He moved his family (wife and four children) all the way from Canada to Cedarville, OH, persuaded that he was going to be a good fit for the Bible department at Cedarville University. After all, the CU hiring process is lengthy and it’s a very long way to move one’s family. After teaching for just two semesters, and closing on a 100 year-old farmhouse in town, he was fired for a doctrinal discrepancy related to his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-End-Rereading-Genesiss-Revelations/dp/1608999270">The Beginning and The End</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the book was already in manuscript form when he was hired by CU, meaning that he wrote this book before he even knew he’d be working at a place that would have loved to see a shout out to Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis somewhere, anywhere in the tome’s 106 pages. Furthermore, the hiring committee was made aware of Dr. Pahl’s forthcoming book, and he taught his sample lecture during the hiring process on Genesis and the creation accounts! But that wasn’t enough to save him from getting “reviewed” by an <em>ad hoc</em> panel and “released from his teaching duties.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, he’s remained on the school’s payroll this academic year, so that he and his family didn’t get sent back to Canada right away without work or housing. However, to the best of my knowledge, he is still looking for work.</p>
<p>“Dr. Pahl’s orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility. He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students. Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.”</p>
<p>What a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">shameful way to treat a gracious and godly immigrant family.</span></p>
<h2 id="carl-ruby">Carl Ruby<img loading="lazy" src="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Images/Campus-News/News/2012/Carl-Ruby-13_001.jpg?w=250" alt=""  />
</h2>
<p>As if the previous two concerns weren’t enough, the University quickly got rid of Carl Ruby, the Vice President for Student Life, this January. Not only have the Administration and Trustees neglected to justify this decision, they refuse to admit that they made the decision in the first place!!! According to the University PR statements, we’re to believe that Carl Ruby, after 25 years of service to his alma mater, randomly decided in January that now would be a great time to seek employment opportunities elsewhere. Apparently he also thought it would be great to leave his office just five days after his resignation was announced for him!</p>
<p>What’s the other option? Moral or legal failure, right? Well, Dr. Gredy (acting CU President) himself denied this at the <a href="http://cedars.cedarville.edu/article/585/SGA-Town-Hall-Meeting-Jan-22/">SGA Town Hall meeting last month</a>, saying that Ruby’s resignation was not due to a personal/moral failure.</p>
<p>What’s left, then? Well, despite my University’s urging to “not connect the dots” on these matters, the unavoidable conclusion is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>Dr. Ruby was FIRED</strong></em> </span>and that CU Admins/Trustees are hesitant (and deceptively so) to admit that.</p>
<p>Compare this “official” answer from the <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Alumni/FAQ.aspx">Cedarville Alumni and Family Questions and Answers</a> page:</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Why did Dr. Carl Ruby leave? </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Dr. John Gredy, Provost, <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Ruby-Legacy-Built-at-Cedarville-University.aspx"><span style="color:#000000;">announced to the University family</span></a> on January 10 that he and Dr. Ruby had come to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a mutual understanding</span> and that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dr. Ruby would conclude his service to Cedarville University</span>. His last day in the office was shortly thereafter, although Dr. Ruby’s administrative contract continues through June 30. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The University is committed to protecting the privacy of its employees so is not commenting publicly on the reasons for the decision</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Sadly, much speculation and questions have arisen. The Board of Trustees at its January 25 meeting carefully reviewed the events surrounding the announcement that Dr. Carl Ruby would conclude his service. The Board acknowledged and expressed regret that the lack of clarity had made this transition even more difficult for the Cedarville University family. Nonetheless, the Board of Trustees supported <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the understanding between Dr. Ruby and the administration</span>. The Board of Trustees expressed its gratitude to Dr. Ruby for his service.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Dr. Ruby built a legacy at Cedarville, and he will be missed by many. The passions Dr. Ruby embraced were not simply his personal interests, but rather reflect core values of the Cedarville family. The University is committed to continuing these priorities.”</span></p>
<div>with this excerpt from the [Dayton Daily News’ most recent piece on Cedarville](http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/cedarville-students-alumni-question-universitys-di/nWQgS/):
<p>“Tennessee Pastor Chris Williamson said he resigned from the school’s board of trustees after being “blindsided” by what he called <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">the administration’s “mistreatment” of the vice president for student life, Carl Ruby</span></strong>, a popular 25-year veteran of Cedarville who resigned last month. […]</p>
<p>“And then, on Jan. 10, it was announced Ruby would “step down” effective June 30. But his last day on campus was Jan. 15, and hundreds of students showed their support by wearing red and lining his walk from his office to his car. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Ruby’s departure was publicly called a resignation. But Williamson said he learned at a January trustees’ meeting, “it was a termination of employment.”</strong></span></p>
<p>and with this excerpt from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/us/a-christian-college-struggles-to-define-itself.html?_r=0">New York Times piece on the Cedarville controversy</a>:</p>
<p>“The Rev. Chris Williamson of Franklin, Tenn., who last month resigned from the Cedarville board of trustees, said that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>both the president and Dr. Ruby were considered problematic by the faction of trustees fearful of what they perceive as a creeping liberalism. “They were threatened by Carl’s approach not to theology but to ministry,”</strong></span> Mr. Williamson said, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“in terms of his ministry to people struggling with gender identification, how he ministers to people on the margins.”</strong></span></p>
<p>It would be frustrating enough if it were a secular organization committing these injustices. But to watch an organization which claims the name of Christ behave in such despicable ways? It’s intolerable.</p>
<p><strong>I’m not the only one who’s frustrated by these things: consider Scot <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2013/02/16/cedarville-the-next-episode/">McKnight</a>, Anthony <a href="http://historicaljesusresearch.blogspot.com/2012/10/concerning-controversy-related-to.html">LeDonne</a>, <a href="http://historicaljesusresearch.blogspot.com/2013/02/cedarville-university-controversy.html">LeDonne again</a>, Michael <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2012/10/michael-pahl-dismissal-from-cedarville-university/">Bird</a>, Mark <a href="http://ntweblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/michael-pahl-and-disgrace-of-cedarville.html">Goodacre</a>, and James <a href="http://jamesmcgahey.blogspot.com/2012/11/reflections-on-firing-of-michael-pahl.html">McGahey</a>.</strong></p>
<p>No, <strong>this does not mean that everyone at Cedarville is dishonest, evil or misguided</strong>. In fact, there are plenty of godly women and men here. Women and men whom I’d like to defend, because I’ve seen how stressful and fearful this environment has become for them and their families.</p>
<p>But <strong>it’s the leadership here I’m worried about</strong>. And as often as the Bible urges respect for leaders, it holds the leaders of the God’s people accountable even more so, often with strong language. Don’t believe me? Go and read the prophets, focusing on their words for the priests and princes of Israel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Images/Campus-News/News/2011/chris-williamson-fall-bible-conference.jpg" alt=""  />
As Chris Williamson put it on his Twitter account:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“There’s nothing more dangerous to the cause of Christ than religious people with an ungodly agenda. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cedarville&amp;src=hash"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><s>#</s>cedarville</span></a>”</strong></span></span></p>
<p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/gdk_chris">@gdk_chris</a>; 12:49 PM – 1 Feb 13).</p>
<p>I couldn’t agree more. And that is why <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>I’m calling the leadership of my University to repent, or to quit claiming to be Christ-centered in these matters.</strong></span></p>
<p>God will not be mocked.</p>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To my sisters and brothers in Christ, entrusted with the arduous task of leading and directing Cedarville University: greetings, grace, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to thank you all for your countless hours of service to this institution. I do not want to underestimate your care and concern for this place. In fact, I want to reassure you that &lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/&#34; title=&#34;My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience&#34;&gt;I share your passion&lt;/a&gt;. Here at Cedarville I have been blessed with the opportunity of meeting, falling in love with, and marrying my wife. Even more importantly, at Cedarville I have fallen in love with the Gospel. Thanks to godly men and women here – whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I’ve been privileged to catch – my eyes have been opened to the richness, complexity, and scope of God’s redemptive mission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To my sisters and brothers in Christ, entrusted with the arduous task of leading and directing Cedarville University: greetings, grace, and peace.</p>
<p>Allow me to thank you all for your countless hours of service to this institution. I do not want to underestimate your care and concern for this place. In fact, I want to reassure you that <a href="http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/" title="My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience">I share your passion</a>. Here at Cedarville I have been blessed with the opportunity of meeting, falling in love with, and marrying my wife. Even more importantly, at Cedarville I have fallen in love with the Gospel. Thanks to godly men and women here – whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I’ve been privileged to catch – my eyes have been opened to the richness, complexity, and scope of God’s redemptive mission.</p>
<p>I therefore raise the following concerns not as one who wants to malign Cedarville, disregard your wisdom, or perpetrate verbal violence. I raise them because I want Cedarville to contribute to God’s Kingdom to the fullest extent possible. I have invested four years of my life here as a CU Scholar, Getting Started Leader, Discipleship Leader, Student Grader, and Resident Assistant. I want future students, perhaps my own children someday, to be able to do the same. I want this University to thrive, inspiring true greatness for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>That is why certain events within the Cedarville community this past year have caused me such great <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">concern</a>. I say this as respectfully as possible: some of your decisions and actions seem to contradict the most precious lessons that I have learned at your institution about the Gospel.</p>
<p>Among other troubling things, including the harassment of those <em>“godly men and women here – whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I’ve been privileged to catch,”</em> I have observed <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/">the following:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>your approval of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/white-papers/">the White Papers</a> on <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Omniscience-White-Paper.pdf">omniscience</a>, <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Forensic-Justification.pdf">justification</a>, and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Creation-White-Paper.pdf">creation</a>,</li>
<li>your rejection of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/theology-major-rejected/">the proposed Theology Major</a>,</li>
<li>your dismissal of<a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/dr-michael-pahl-dismissed/"> Dr. Michael Pahl</a>,</li>
<li>the untimely resignation of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/dr-browns-resignation/">Dr. William Brown</a>,</li>
<li>the extremely untimely resignation of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/ruby-resigns/">Dr. Carl Ruby</a>,</li>
<li>your imminent cancellation of the <a href="http://ourcuprotest.wordpress.com/">Philosophy Major</a>,</li>
<li>and subsequent imminent release of either Dr. Shawn Graves or Dr. David Mills.</li>
</ul>
<p>As your younger brother in Christ, I am obligated to approach you <em><strong>peacefully</strong></em>. However, given the circumstances, it seems I am also obligated to approach you <em><strong>prophetically</strong></em>. Because of the biblical concept of *<strong>shalom</strong> as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">true peace</span>, I believe I can do both at the same time. For <em>true peace</em> is not the absence of conflict or strong words, but the longing of the prophets for the time and place where the image-bearers of Yahweh will be reconciled to one another, to all of creation, and to God himself. It is the relational fullness and completeness of God’s justice-based, truth-filled, and transparent Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, then, I cry out for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>justice</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, I cry out for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>truth</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, I cry out for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>transparency</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For brevity’s sake, I’d like to distill my myriad concerns and frustrations into just two questions. After all, I’m just an undergraduate, and you do not owe me a thorough explanation of all the managerial minutiae behind your every move. However, you do owe me – along with current/future faculty, staff, students, and constituency – a thorough and impeccably honest explanation of <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cedarville University’s Identity and Vision</span></strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>In the interests of shalom, justice, truth, and transparency, I cry out for answer to the following two questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is Cedarville University?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What does Cedarville University hope to become?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All of your actions and decisions mentioned above, from the harassment of my mentors and friends to the proposed cancellation of the Philosophy Major, point towards Cedarville University being and becoming a <strong>fundamentalist</strong> (<em>euphemistically, a “conservative evangelical”)</em> <strong>institution</strong> – silencing honest dialogue, erecting thick walls between “us” and “them,” and carving out our own niche instead of engaging the unified diversity of God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>After all, Dr. Ruby and Dr. Brown were two of Cedarville’s most prominent voices calling for <strong>a robust evangelicalism, for this self-proclaimed liberal arts university to embrace and embody both cultural and ideological diversity – in the hopes of becoming one of the most influential Christ-centered learning communities in the twenty-first century.</strong></p>
<p>I and many others came to Cedarville University to study, work, and teach because we find this vision extremely compelling. We find things like poorly-written White Papers, inadequately explained rejections/cancellations of valuable majors, and questionable, sudden changes in beloved personnel much less compelling.</p>
<p>I will give you the benefit of the doubt and not discuss at-length the <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">many</span></strong></em> rumors and reports of shameful things like <em>ad hoc</em> and biased “review” panels, bullying, power plays, and gag orders. If the rumors be true, then perhaps someone much higher than I should call for your repentance, if not your resignations. Such is the high responsibility of having “<em>For the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus Christ</em>” as your institutional motto.</p>
<p>However, I will ask you for one important thing: <strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">your honesty about where you want to take Cedarville University</span></em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span></strong></p>
<p>Here’s why: as the Administration and Board of Trustees, you have a certain right to decide whether or not Cedarville will be robustly evangelical or fundamentalist. We might strongly disagree about which of those two options is preferable, but at the end of the day you make that decision, not I.</p>
<p>However, you have no right to <strong>obfuscate</strong> or <strong>vacillate</strong> on these important matters of identity and vision. While I can’t tell you what direction to take this University, I can boldly ask that <strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">you decide and then very clearly and publicly announce your decision</span></em>.</strong></p>
<p>Even if I and many others disagree with your decision, we will respect you much more for your clarity. Trying to accomplish your goals behind the scenes has only resulted in confusion, damage, and pain to several individuals and families within the Cedarville community. In the wake of Dr. Pahl’s dismissal and the questionable resignations of Dr. Brown and Dr. Ruby, we need a clear statement, not a polished and vague press release. If you don’t plainly declare your position and objectives, then we will be forced to assume the worst regarding your motives.</p>
<p>After all, if achieving your goals involves getting rid of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Michael Pahl</strong></em>, an outstanding biblical theologian of whom you were willing to say: “[his] orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility. He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students.”</li>
<li><em><strong>William Brown</strong></em>, the president and beloved face of Cedarville University for thousands of students.</li>
<li>and <em><strong>Carl Ruby</strong></em>, a man whose respect and admiration from students, faculty, and staff transcend cultural, theological, and political dispositions…a preeminent model of Christ-like service, love, patience, respect, grace, and wisdom…and a pioneer for open and honest dialogue for the sake of God’s Kingdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>…then your goals are probably in need of <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">revision</span></strong>, but they are most certainly in need of <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">immediate clarification</span></strong>.</p>
<p>For the sake of our Messiah, Savior, Lord, and King whose crown our University bears on its seal, I appeal to you as your younger brother in the faith: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">publicly declare your vision for the future of Cedarville University</span>. In the face of the growing angst, confusion, and frustration among students, alumni, faculty, staff, and constituency, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">explicitly state who you do and do not want working, teaching, and therefore studying at the University.</span></p>
<p>It is my prayer that, as a result of your honesty and transparency, Cedarville University might become a more peaceful and just community in the midst of God’s shalom-filled Kingdom.</p>
<p>For King and Kingdom,</p>
<p>Joshua Steele</p>
<p>Cedarville University Class of 2013</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you haven’t read my previous two blog posts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/&#34; title=&#34;Cedarville, Let there be Light.

Using the University’s statement on Dr. Pahl, I’ve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>If you haven’t read my previous two blog posts, <a href="http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/" title="Cedarville, Let there be Light.

(pt. 2)">pt. 2)</a>,” please go do so before reading this post.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: I’ve been blogging in order to raise awareness of Cedarville University’s recent dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl from his teaching post. Using the University’s statement on Dr. Pahl, I’ve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above (<em>in the statement</em>, orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University?</li>
<li>Don’t we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m writing today because the responses I’ve gotten to those posts and questions have been mixed. Some think I’m doing something that is both <em>righteous</em> and <em>necessary</em>, respectfully raising awareness and asking uncomfortable-yet-necessary questions. Others think I’m being <em>un</em>-biblical and <em>disrespectful</em> in my approach, and that I should handle these matters privately (cf. <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3AMatthew%2018%3A15-net_strongs__notes%3AMatthew%2018">Matt 18:15-22</a> and such).</p>
<p>Clearly, I’m a bit biased toward the first reaction. It’s always more pleasant to think of your actions as both righteous and necessary, after all. However, that doesn’t negate the careful line to walk in this situation. Several things must be held in Christ-honoring tension, such as <strong>boldness</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>respect</strong>, <strong>honesty</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>love</strong>, <strong>persistence</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>patience</strong>, a hunger for <strong>justice</strong> <em>and</em> an even <em>stronger</em> craving for <strong>God’s perfect <em>shalom</em> peace</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve been personally challenged by <a href="http://rustlingsinthegrass.blogspot.com/2012/09/friday-reflectionary-psalm-54.html?spref=tw">Dr. Pahl’s recent blog post</a>. How, in the face of injustice, are we to hold <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3APsalms%2054%3A0-net_strongs__search%3APsalm%2054">David’s cries for vengeance in Psalm 54</a> in tension with <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3ARomans%2012%3A9-net_strongs__search%3ARomans%2012%3A9">Paul’s calls for peace in Romans 12:14, 17a?</a> Consider this quote from Dr. Pahl’s conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When we experience injustice, then, we are to follow in the footsteps of Jesus.</strong></p>
<p><em>We cry out to God in our suffering, even in the raw depths of our agony, trusting God to walk with us through the suffering, entrusting our vindication to God in his timing and his way.</em></p>
<p><em>We speak truth to ourselves and to others, even to those who have committed the injustice, even to those in power, naming sin and evil for what it is.</em></p>
<p><em>We resist evil by refusing to engage in evil acts ourselves; we resist violence done to us by refusing to engage in violence ourselves, whether violent actions or violent words. Instead, we engage in acts of self-giving, life-giving love for the other.</em></p>
<p><em>And through it all we remind ourselves of our own sin, now forgiven, as we see the sin of others against us, waiting to be forgiven.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>His words above, along with Dr. Tim Gombis’ words in <a href="http://timgombis.com/2012/09/18/the-logic-of-religious-violence/">“The Logic of Religious Violence”</a> are at the front of mind as I pursue these issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christians, however, must draw upon God’s grace to remain in the shape of the cross even when our survival appears to be at stake, or when things appear to be out of control in our culture. Remaining in the shape of the cross (refusing to retaliate, returning evil with good, loving those who hate us, controlling ourselves to speak kindly to those with whom we disagree) embodies faith in the resurrection and trust in God’s sovereignty. […]</p>
<p>Let’s remember that cruciformity is the only way of hope and promise for those who confess loyalty to the Lord Christ. The way of violence (rhetorical and physical) is only and always the way of death.</p></blockquote>
<p>If anyone suggests that I somehow hate Cedarville University and am merely trying to damage its reputation, that simply is not true. On the contrary, I have a deep love for Cedarville. I have been richly blessed by God during my time here, and it is my sincere hope that the students who come after me have the chance to grow and thrive even more than I have. If you don’t believe me, please read my previous post, <a href="http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/" title="My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience">“My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience.”</a></p>
<p>Dr. Pahl’s dismissal, therefore, concerns me precisely <strong>because</strong> I care about Cedarville University. While I do not want to respond to what I believe is injustice with rhetorical violence of my own, I also do not want to ignore the dismissal of a godly professor over one of the best books I have ever read (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270"><em>The Beginning and The End</em></a>, with its remarkably non-incendiary handling of two of the most vitriolic areas of Christian doctrine).</p>
<p>Furthermore, I do not believe that the principles of Matthew 18:15-22 directly apply in this situation. This is not an interpersonal conflict I have with a brother or sister in Christ, this is an institution’s action which I believe to be both unjust and troubling.</p>
<p>Yes, Cedarville University is a very visible Christ-centered learning community, and it should be treated with respect and dignity. I do not want to needlessly damage its reputation, especially in the eyes of non-believers. However, Cedarville is an organization, and as such it needs to be held to a high standard when it comes to things like truth, justice, and transparency…especially <em><strong>because</strong></em> it claims to be a <em><strong>Christ</strong></em>-centered community!</p>
<p>In closing, two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If godly professors like Dr. Pahl can write a book the quality of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270"><em>The Beginning and the End</em></a>, and even be praised (in the statement regarding his dismissal, no less) as <em>orthodox</em> and committed to <em>Scripture,</em> the <em>gospel</em>, promising <em>scholarship</em>, and dedicated <em>teaching</em>, and <em><strong>still</strong></em> be relieved from teaching duties, then no faculty member is safe. This move does not seem to promote the gospel, God’s kingdom, or even academic freedom…it instead promotes a culture of fear and “us” vs. “them.” That’s why we need things like truth and transparency after something like this happens.</li>
<li>If students like myself cannot respectfully-yet-openly question such events out of concern for not only professors like Dr. Pahl, but for the entire institution’s future and health, something is wrong. And if we are instead punished, censored, or encouraged toward indifference, something is <em><strong>profoundly</strong></em> wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please hold me accountable to my desires to honor Christ in this endeavor. He is my King and deserves my full allegiance. And please, if you claim the name of Christ, <em><strong>care</strong></em> about matters such as this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it’s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it’s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it’s indifference.”<br>
― <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1049.Elie_Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a></p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/&#34; title=&#34;Cedarville, Let there be Light. (pt. 1)&#34;&gt;Read Part One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;further-questions-all-relating-to-the-university-statement-on-dr-pahls-dismissal&#34;&gt;Further Questions, All Relating to the University Statement on Dr. Pahl’s Dismissal:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Dr. Pahl’s book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beginning and the End&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was controversial enough to lead to his dismissal, why was the book allowed to be used as a textbook last school year?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shouldn’t we trust the Bible professors’ judgment in their selection of the book as a text?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we should, then was it worth firing Dr. Pahl over a book which other CU professors approved of enough to require as a text for their courses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, why not? Why don’t we trust these highly-trained men and women as an institution? Shouldn’t they be a resource instead of a feared danger? Does this potential fear have anything to do with Dr. Pahl being dismissed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do all members of the Board of Trustees agree with “each and every position of Cedarville University’s Doctrinal Statement” in the way Dr. Pahl was expected to in order to still be allowed to teach?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If he was dismissed, despite the apparent alignment of his personal views and those expressed in his writing to the Doctrinal Statement, is there a possibility that some of the trustees should also be dismissed according to such strict standards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was Dr. Pahl dismissed for something that wrote which contradicts the Doctrinal Statement? If so, what was it exactly that he wrote? (I have been unable to find anything in &lt;em&gt;The Beginning and the End&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Dr. Pahl was not fired for something he wrote, was he fired for something that he &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;write? Again, if so, what was it exactly that he didn’t affirm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, is firing someone for not affirming something fair? Are all professors required to affirm the Doctrinal Statement in its entirety in everything they write and/or publish?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the administration’s vision for the future of the Bible Department at Cedarville University?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does firing an orthodox, promising scholar who is committed to Scripture and to the gospel help to achieve that vision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has Dr. Pahl been cared for by the University in any way during this process? As our brother in Christ, have we dismissed him in a way that is honoring to God and helpful to him and his family?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What explanation has been given to the students who have been affected by Dr. Pahl’s dismissal (i.e. the ones registered for his classes)? Has that explanation been accurate and forthright?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are any other professors currently being considered for dismissal by the University for things they have written and published?&lt;/li&gt;

<h1 id="further-questions-all-relating-to-the-university-statement-on-dr-pahls-dismissal">Further Questions, All Relating to the University Statement on Dr. Pahl’s Dismissal:</h1>
<ul>
<li>If Dr. Pahl’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270"><em>The Beginning and the End</em></a>, was controversial enough to lead to his dismissal, why was the book allowed to be used as a textbook last school year?
<ul>
<li>Shouldn’t we trust the Bible professors’ judgment in their selection of the book as a text?</li>
<li>If we should, then was it worth firing Dr. Pahl over a book which other CU professors approved of enough to require as a text for their courses?</li>
<li>If not, why not? Why don’t we trust these highly-trained men and women as an institution? Shouldn’t they be a resource instead of a feared danger? Does this potential fear have anything to do with Dr. Pahl being dismissed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do all members of the Board of Trustees agree with “each and every position of Cedarville University’s Doctrinal Statement” in the way Dr. Pahl was expected to in order to still be allowed to teach?
<ul>
<li>If he was dismissed, despite the apparent alignment of his personal views and those expressed in his writing to the Doctrinal Statement, is there a possibility that some of the trustees should also be dismissed according to such strict standards?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was Dr. Pahl dismissed for something that wrote which contradicts the Doctrinal Statement? If so, what was it exactly that he wrote? (I have been unable to find anything in <em>The Beginning and the End</em>)</li>
<li>If Dr. Pahl was not fired for something he wrote, was he fired for something that he <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>didn’t</em> </span>write? Again, if so, what was it exactly that he didn’t affirm?</li>
<li>Furthermore, is firing someone for not affirming something fair? Are all professors required to affirm the Doctrinal Statement in its entirety in everything they write and/or publish?</li>
<li>What is the administration’s vision for the future of the Bible Department at Cedarville University?</li>
<li>How does firing an orthodox, promising scholar who is committed to Scripture and to the gospel help to achieve that vision?</li>
<li>Has Dr. Pahl been cared for by the University in any way during this process? As our brother in Christ, have we dismissed him in a way that is honoring to God and helpful to him and his family?</li>
<li>What explanation has been given to the students who have been affected by Dr. Pahl’s dismissal (i.e. the ones registered for his classes)? Has that explanation been accurate and forthright?</li>
<li>Are any other professors currently being considered for dismissal by the University for things they have written and published?</li>
</ul>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-statement&#34;&gt;The Statement:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Michael Pahl has been relieved of his teaching duties because he is unable to concur fully with each and every position of&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx&#34;&gt; Cedarville University’s doctrinal statement&lt;/a&gt;. This decision was made following a review by the University administration and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx&#34;&gt;trustees&lt;/a&gt; prompted by Dr. Pahl’s recent book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270&#34;&gt;The Beginning and the End: Rereading Genesis’s Stories and Revelation’s Visions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pahl’s orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility. He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students. Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.”</p>
<h1 id="the-logic-of-the-statement">The “Logic” of the Statement:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Despite the Following:
<ul>
<li>Dr. Michael Pahl is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">orthodox</span>.</li>
<li>Dr. Pahl is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">committed to the gospel</span>.</li>
<li>Dr. Pahl is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">committed to Scripture, its inspiration, authority, and infallibility</span>.</li>
<li>Dr. Pahl is a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">promising scholar</span>.</li>
<li>Dr. Pahl is a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">dedicated teacher</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The administration and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx">trustees </a>of Cedarville University have <span style="text-decoration:underline;">“relieved” Dr. Pahl of his teaching duties. </span>
<ul>
<li>“because he is unable to concur fully with each and every position of <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">Cedarville University’s doctrinal statement</a>“</li>
<li>…”prompted by Dr. Pahl’s recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270">The Beginning and the End: Rereading Genesis’s Stories and Revelation’s Visions</a>.”</li>
<li>because it is in the best interests of the “constituency” at this time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="hence-the-following-questions">Hence, the Following Questions:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Why were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above (orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University?</li>
<li>Don’t we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not?</li>
<li>Upon review of Dr. Pahl’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270">book</a>, I do not see how it contradicts with any of the points of Cedarville’s doctrinal statement.
<ul>
<li>Have I missed something?</li>
<li>Are there more standards that the ones enumerated in the Doctrinal Statement that the professors are expected to hold to (i.e. White Papers)?</li>
<li>If so, why aren’t these made public? If the White Papers flow directly from the Doctrinal Statement, and if they are important enough to fire faculty over, then shouldn’t the students and general public know about them?</li>
<li>Is it possible that other motivations are at play here?</li>
<li>Does the “best interests of its constituency” imply that Dr. Pahl was dismissed from teaching because of non-doctrinal concerns?</li>
<li>Was this decision in any way motivated by attendance or enrollment or popularity of the institution in certain Christians’ eyes?</li>
<li>If that’s the case, then why would those things be worth more than “the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ” to the administration and the trustees?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What did “the review by the University administration and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx">trustees</a>” look like? Were the proceedings ethical? Were the proceedings made public in any way so as to provide for oversight?</li>
<li>What is the definition of “constituency” according to the statement above? Does it include the entire constituency of the University, or just a select portion?</li>
</ul>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx&#34;&gt;the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization’s agenda, and &lt;strong&gt;how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism…&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx">the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24</a>, I’d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization’s agenda, and <strong>how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism</strong>.</p>
<p>I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism…</p>
<p>…and then I learned more about how to study the Bible.</p>
<p>And now I’m not so sure that people like Ken Ham are really about humbly submitting to what Scripture has to say. Instead, they seem to hold tightly to an anti-intellectual hermeneutic of suspicion and paranoia.It’s all about “us” vs. “them,” about building thick walls and banishing the “crazy liberals” from our midst. And the more I listen to the rhetoric, the more I’m convinced that <strong>anyone</strong> can become a crazy liberal, so long as they disagree with key figures such as Ken Ham about anything.</p>
<p>Consider the following quote from <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2011/11/03/anointed-evangelicals-and-authority-1-rjs/">a review of The Anointed: Evangelical Truth in a Secular Age (by R. Stephens and K. Giberson): </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ken Ham, with no scientific credentials, no credentials in biblical scholarship, no evidence, and no research program, has become the front person, the spokesman for a large segment of evangelicalism. He proves nothing, he asserts what he finds to be truth and tells a story to make it so. He is a charismatic speaker on a mission and has become for many the authority on the evil of evolution and the dishonesty of modern science. Ken Ham and his organization Answers in Genesis have become “<em>powerful shapers of popular opinion in America’s vast evangelical subculture.</em>”</p>
<p>Ken Ham is an anointed and respected authority in much of American evangelicalism and fundamentalism.</p>
<p>One of the premises of Stephens and Giberson is that the broader evangelical culture has become enamored of the charismatic individual who can tell a good story, do it in a flashy and entertaining fashion, and has a message easily reduced to simple black and white points. Ken Ham is such an individual.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why is Ken Ham believed?</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>People like Ken Ham and AiG claim to have a <strong>high</strong> view of Scripture and to hold to a “literal” reading… but in reality, I think that they have a <strong>low</strong> view of Scripture because they are unwilling to even consider that certain passages were <em>not</em> written to answer the questions we might like them to answer for us! If we don’t even try to approach the text <em>on its own terms</em>, then I would argue that we’re being <em>unfaithful</em> to Scripture.</p>
<p>For those of you still reading who don’t think I’m a crazy liberal yet (I can assure you, I’m not), consider the following resources as first steps in moving beyond Ken Ham, AiG, and the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism, to what Scripture actually has to say about creation!</p>

      <title>My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The following is an expanded version of the speech I gave at this year’s CU Scholar Dessert Reception.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I ever decided about Cedarville University was that I would not, under any circumstances, attend. Since my administrator’s son, Drew Flamm, worked in admissions at CU, I had been inundated since before I could remember with calls to become a yellow-jacket, and out of sheer stubbornness of heart, I refused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(The following is an expanded version of the speech I gave at this year’s CU Scholar Dessert Reception.)</em></p>
<p>The first thing I ever decided about Cedarville University was that I would not, under any circumstances, attend. Since my administrator’s son, Drew Flamm, worked in admissions at CU, I had been inundated since before I could remember with calls to become a yellow-jacket, and out of sheer stubbornness of heart, I refused.</p>
<p>Almost seven years later, and I stand before you all with the hopes of graduating next May. What changed? Well, for starters, God’s grace was, well, irresistible for even a stubborn high school student named Joshua Steele. While I don’t have time now to recount all the details, suffice it to say that receiving this scholarship was the final capstone of a tumultuous and miraculous college search process. I offer my sincerest thanks to the members of the selection committee. I stand before you now on nothing but a mountain of God’s grace, of which your generosity has been no small portion.</p>
<p>As I near the end of my Cedarville experience, two things have made my journey thus far particularly unforgettable and life-changing:</p>
<p>Firstly, at Cedarville I met and fell in love with my wife, Rachel. That’s right, we met in Up-Chucks the first time my freshman unit got the chance to meet our Printy sisters. It wasn’t love at first sight, but it was love pretty darn quick. Together we’ve been Getting Started Leaders, served as brother/sister RAs, worked together at summer camp, completed a marathon… and now we’re lifelong partners in the pursuit of God’s grace and shalom. I don’t care if this sounds trite to some, falling in love with my girlfriend, fiancée, and now wife has been the most rewarding-yet-challenging aspect of my time here at Cedarville. I can’t wait to see how God uses us for his kingdom in the future.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying that everyone in here has to find a husband or wife and get married during their time here at Cedarville. Furthermore, and this is especially for the underclassmen, I hope that your Cedarville experience is somehow better than mine. But could I encourage you all to do the second thing that’s made my Cedarville experience unforgettable?</p>
<p>At Cedarville I fell in love with the Gospel and learned how big God’s redemptive mission is. I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Preseminary Bible because, by God’s grace at the time I finished high school, I was sick of pretending like the Gospel was a shallow flow-chart or bullet-pointed list that could be pulled off the shelf and employed in a five-minute conversation in order to “make a new Christian.”</p>
<p>I knew that something was wrong, and I wanted to devote my years at Cedarville to learning more about the Gospel in order someday to be better able to preach that good news to others. While I’ve only just begun to scratch the surface, I have learned a few important things during my time here, things that have made the Gospel all the more precious to me.</p>
<p>And I owe many of these lessons to the godly professors who have poured into my life, (directly or indirectly), whose vision for God’s redemptive mission I have been privileged to “catch.” People like TC Ham, John White, Carl Smith, Jeff Cook, David Mills, Chris Miller, Dan Estes, Joel Williams, Tim Gombis, and Michael Pahl.</p>
<p><strong>See it’s frighteningly easy to slice and dice the <em>missio Dei</em>, the mission of God, into dilapidated pieces. We want the moralistic “holiness” slice, the private piety chunk, the ticket to escape from hell-fire, the perfect precision in doctrinal orthodoxy, and the list goes on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>None of these are bad things, but when we act as if they’re the main thing, we fragment the Gospel, which fragments the Church, and we’re left with nothing but a shadow of the gloriously good news that, in Christ, God is reconciling the world to himself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That is, God is “heading-up” all things, things on heaven and things on earth,</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the Jews and the Gentiles</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the rich and the poor</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the Regular Baptists and the Southern Baptists</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the Presbyterians and the Catholics</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the angry fundamentalists and the crazy liberals</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the black and the white</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the “have”s and the “have-not”s</strong></p>
<p><strong>…”us” and “them”</strong></p>
<p><strong>ALL THINGS, THINGS ON HEAVEN AND THINGS ON EARTH,</strong></p>
<p><strong>in His Son, who has defeated Sin and Death, and whom we proclaim as King, Messiah, Savior, and Lord over the entire universe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These truths can unify us, as Jesus prayed for in John 17. They can radically change the way we see God, other human beings, the universe around us, and even the way we see ourselves.</strong></p>
<p>But they can also alter the life of the son of a bricklayer and a homemaker from Toledo, OH, who has no other reason for his unforgettable Cedarville experience than the sheer grace of God alone.</p>

      <title>Wedding Vows: My Personal Take on the Traditional Version</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-traditional-wedding-vows&#34;&gt;The Traditional Wedding Vows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn’t know, the “traditional” wedding vows – in English, at least – are found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bcponline.org/&#34;&gt;Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/baskerville.htm&#34;&gt;1662 Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, the marriage vows read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love and to cheriſh, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-traditional-wedding-vows">The Traditional Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>In case you didn’t know, the “traditional” wedding vows – in English, at least – are found in the <a href="http://www.bcponline.org/">Book of Common Prayer</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/baskerville.htm">1662 Book of Common Prayer</a>, the marriage vows read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,</strong><br>
<strong>from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love and to cheriſh, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I N. take thee M. to my wedded huſband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love, cheriſh, and to obey, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>When we got married in August 2012, my wife, Rachel, and I decided to write our own vows, at least loosely based upon the traditional vows. (Give us a break, we weren’t yet Anglicans!)</p>
<p>So, here are the vows I wrote, and still endeavor to keep as Rachel’s husband!</p>
<h1 id="my-wedding-vows">My Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>I, Joshua Patrick Steele, pledge myself to you, Rachel Elizabeth, as your husband.</p>
<p>I solemnly vow:</p>
<p>to love you as I have been loved by Love himself,</p>
<p>to take joy daily in your beauty and worth as God’s precious daughter,</p>
<p>to cling to you faithfully with mind, soul, and body,</p>
<p>in light and in darkness,</p>
<p>in summer and in winter,</p>
<p>in springtime and in harvest,</p>
<p>in plenty and in famine,</p>
<p>through Sheol to Eden,</p>
<p>in sickly decay and in healthy vigor,</p>
<p>in unspeakable joy and in bitter sorrow,</p>
<p>in the tempests of chaos and in the calms of perfect peace.</p>
<p>And, by your side, to pursue relentlessly God’s grace and shalom</p>
<p>until Death parts us</p>
<p>or Death itself is vanquished by our coming King,</p>
<p>in whose presence I hereto pledge you my faithfulness.</p>

      <title>Unity?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I’ve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.</p>
<p>What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I’ve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.</p>
<p>It’s not that I’ve never heard about the importance of unity before. But when the topic has been addressed in the past, it’s amounted to little more than being nice to my friends…people who are already likely to be remarkably similar to me, people already within the little camp of Christianity in which I have grown-up.</p>
<p>But it’s never been encouraged to spread to other Christian “camps.” Forget the Pentecostals, Anglicans, Methodists, Catholics, Presbyterians, etc. If the pastor’s feeling a bit edgy, we can partner with them on service projects, but unless the “others” get their act together, they are to be tolerated at best, and at worst ridiculed.</p>
<p>Instead, in my particular stream of Christianity, the focus has been placed on two things: <strong>doctrinal orthodoxy</strong> and <strong>moral purity</strong>.</p>
<p>Please don’t hear me wrongly, I am not denying the importance of either of these two things. God is meant to be known well, and to do that we must think, talk, teach, and speak about him well. Theology is not to be a shoddy enterprise, and we must constantly examine ourselves, aware of the shortcomings of our humanness, in the pursuit of understanding of Yahweh. Furthermore, Yahweh is a holy God. He hates Sin and Death, and if we are serious about following him, we must hate Sin and Death as well.</p>
<p>Christ calls us to live Genesis 1-2 lives in a Genesis 3 world.</p>
<p>But, wait a second. Go back and read that again. “Christ calls us to live Genesis 1-2 lives in a Genesis 3 world.” What popped into your head as you read that sentence? What should characterize that Genesis 1-2 kind of life?</p>
<p>I fear that, if you’ve inherited the same stream of Christianity that I have, <strong>unity</strong> and <strong>interpersonal relationships</strong> were not the first things to color your vision of what Genesis 1-2 would look like today. Instead, we (conservative evangelical North American Christians) are much more likely to think of living a morally spotless life driven by a flawless theology. With no sin to fetter us and lead us toward doctrinal laxity, we would be free to enjoy God forever.</p>
<p>We have flattened Christianity by focusing on these things at the expense of focusing on the rich vision of community and unity that we find in the pages of Scripture. Read Genesis 1-2. We were created to enjoy God, yes. We were created to live without sin, yes. But we were created to enjoy and be enjoyed by each other. We were made to know and be known. God’s perfect shalom included much more than moral purity and doctrinal orthodoxy. It included perfect <strong>relationships</strong>: with God, with each other, with our own “self”s, and with all of creation.</p>
<p>And likewise, the Fall of Genesis 3 broke relationships. It separated us from God, estranged us from each other, introduced discord within our own psyches, and infected the creation in which we dwell. Sin and Death were unleashed into the cosmos, and they have polluted and twisted every layer.</p>
<p>The call back to Genesis 1-2 therefore involves much more than right doctrine and moral purity. God is in the process of redeeming everything. And every time we cut his redemptive mission in half (or sometimes smaller), we do so at our own peril.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…toward the administration of the fullness of the times, to head up<sup> </sup><em><strong>all things</strong></em> in Christ – the things in *heaven<sup> </sup>*and the things on <em>earth.</em> (Ephesians 1:10 NET)</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that God’s heart breaks over the lack of unity in his Church today. Is he pleased with the individual moral sins we love to emphasize? By no means. Is he pleased with bad theology? No way. But something is seriously amiss if we do not think that God’s heart breaks over the fragmentation within the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>What do you think about this issue? Why does this not bother us like it should? And most importantly, what can we do to address this problem?</p>
<p>Grace and peace,</p>
<p>~Josh</p>

      <title>My High School Graduation Valedictorian Speech was a Poem</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-valedictorian-address-a-poem&#34;&gt;My Valedictorian Address, a Poem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is my valedictorian speech, delivered at my high school graduation in 2009. As you’ll see below, the majority of the speech was an original poem. Sure, I’m tempted to be a bit embarrassed by the poem today, but I’m also proud that I went for it. Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

<p>The following is my valedictorian speech, delivered at my high school graduation in 2009. As you’ll see below, the majority of the speech was an original poem. Sure, I’m tempted to be a bit embarrassed by the poem today, but I’m also proud that I went for it. Let me know what you think!</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="graduation">GRADUATION!</h1>
<p>Such a mix of emotions comes with this simple word…</p>
<p><strong>Students</strong> are exhilarated to finally be done with yet another chapter of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Parents</strong> are also excited, yet saddened perhaps by the fact that their little babies are now about to embark into the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty</strong> are relieved to get such a motley group of troublemakers out of their school!Guests are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony,</p>
<p><strong>Guests</strong> are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony, which is customarily concluded by a farewell address from the graduating <strong>valedictorian</strong>:</p>
<p>A poor individual who must say goodbye while also addressing all parties and emotions involved, all within the space of a short speech.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mrs. Covrett, my English teacher, taught me that <strong>poetry</strong> is the language of both emotion and economy.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, amidst the trials and tribulations of AP English Literature and Composition, we read a poem entitled <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44131/a-valediction-forbidding-mourning">“A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning</a>.”</p>
<p>This poem, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne">John Donne</a> about a love that transcends physical separation between him and his beloved, inspired me to compose my own work in the interests of avoiding both triteness and plagiarism on this most auspicious occasion.</p>
<p>Now, John Donne forbade his beloved from openly mourning his departure.</p>
<p>While I do not think it fitting for me to forbid anyone anything, please indulge me a few moments of your time as we look both back at the past and ahead into the future by way of my poem, entitled:</p>
<h1 id="a-valediction">A VALEDICTION</h1>
<p>The years, a road before us<br>
This school, the path behind<br>
And who can know what lies ahead?<br>
The twists and turns we’ll find</p>
<p>Our time, it passes swiftly,<br>
This life will soon be gone<br>
When we look back upon our days,<br>
What is it we’ll have done?</p>
<p>The world has many pleasures<br>
its riches and its fame<br>
Yet none of these are lasting treasures<br>
for all face death the same</p>
<p>We’ve all one life to use now,<br>
Our time will soon be past<br>
And though this world will pass away,<br>
What’s done for Christ will last.</p>
<p>For years, we’ve learned and grown here,<br>
a foundation has been laid.<br>
The future looms before us now,<br>
a choice has to be made:</p>
<p>To waste our lives upon ourselves?<br>
To build on sinking sand?<br>
Or found ourselves upon the Rock,<br>
Who holds us in His hands?</p>
<p>The choice may seem quite simple now,<br>
as though the battle’s won,<br>
but day by day, the world cries out<br>
“Don’t fret! Go play! Have fun!”</p>
<p>Our lives will have their share of joy,<br>
Good gifts from God each day.<br>
But don’t be fooled, there’s pain as well<br>
There’s bumps along our way.</p>
<p>Should we be scared? Can we succeed?<br>
Is there hope amidst the fear?<br>
Will we press on? or stop to heed<br>
those voices in our ear:</p>
<p>“Turn back! This way is difficult!<br>
It’s much too hard for you!<br>
Too frightening, there’s no comfort there,<br>
You’ll never make it through!”</p>
<p>Don’t stop! Press on! For don’t we know?<br>
and have not we been told?<br>
It’s only through the fire<br>
You obtain the purest gold.</p>
<p>We have a God in Heaven<br>
A Father and a Guide<br>
He gives the strength to carry on<br>
To those who would reside</p>
<p>in Him. we find our purpose<br>
In Him we find the way<br>
to live our lives unwasted<br>
,to boldly face each day.</p>
<p>For He alone knows how much time<br>
we have to walk the road<br>
And He alone knows every trial,<br>
The weight of each our loads</p>
<p>Though high school is now over<br>
We’ve so much more to do!<br>
The door has been flung-open,<br>
and now we must walk through–</p>
<p>We’ll miss the loving people here<br>
Who’ve helped us on our way.<br>
Though time and distance come between,<br>
Our thankfulness won’t fade.</p>
<p>So, Mom and Dad, we thank you for<br>
The time and love you give.<br>
You’ve been there through our best and worst<br>
To show us how to live.</p>
<p>Our teachers, better mentors<br>
We would be hard-pressed to find.<br>
They’ve taught us both to seek the Truth<br>
And always guard our minds.</p>
<p>So many more deserve our thanks,<br>
Yet words cannot convey<br>
The boundless debt of gratitude<br>
That we should rightly pay.</p>
<p>And now we say “farewell”<br>
“Goodbye,” as we depart.<br>
One journey ends, another’s here<br>
on which we must embark.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is an original Mother’s Day poem of mine, that I wrote for my mom (the best mom ever, of course) back in 2009. It’s called “From a Grateful Son,” and I hope that you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-a-grateful-son--a-poem-for-my-mother&#34;&gt;From a Grateful Son – A Poem for My Mother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Mom, for having me&lt;br&gt;
that day so long ago.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you, then, for holding me&lt;br&gt;
and now for letting go.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you, Mom, for giving me&lt;br&gt;
your patience, time, and care.&lt;br&gt;
And thank you, Mom, for loving me&lt;br&gt;
for always being there –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Thank you, Mom, for having me<br>
that day so long ago.<br>
Thank you, then, for holding me<br>
and now for letting go.<br>
Thank you, Mom, for giving me<br>
your patience, time, and care.<br>
And thank you, Mom, for loving me<br>
for always being there –</p>
<p>Thanks so much for teaching me<br>
both how to read and write.<br>
For every single grueling day<br>
and every sleepless night.<br>
Thank you, Mom, for aiming high,<br>
for helping me succeed.<br>
For never letting me forget<br>
that you believe in me.</p>
<p>Mom, you mean so much to me.<br>
My words cannot convey<br>
The debt of love, of care-filled work<br>
That I should rightly pay.<br>
Though distance, time, and life itself<br>
may take me far away,<br>
I’ll always be your little boy<br>
with these three words to say –</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
