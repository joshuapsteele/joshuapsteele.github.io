<h2 id="if-there-are-two-things-i-hate-they-are-waiting-and-staying-awake">If there are two things I hate, they are waiting and staying awake.</h2>
<p>I hate waiting.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who knows me. I am absolutely horrible when it comes to delayed gratification. I’ve been known to open new boxes of cereal on the way home from the store.</p>
<p>And I hate staying awake.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who knows me. I’m convinced that nothing good happens after 10:00 o’clock at night. 9 o’clock, really, if I’m honest.</p>
<p>(Ahem, and my young children have driven this point home!)</p>
<p>Keeping watch all night long sounds like the worst thing in the world. I mean, unless you’re in the middle of a good book or an episode of Bake-Off, why not just go to bed?</p>
<ul>
<li>I hate waiting.</li>
<li>I hate staying awake.</li>
<li>I am impatient!</li>
<li>I am tired!</li>
</ul>
<p>And I’m wondering if Kevin or God assigned me this sermon on purpose!</p>
<p>Maybe it’s appropriate that I can literally see myself on the computer screen that I’m preaching to!</p>
<p>Friends, it’s been a long year. We last gathered in-person for Holy Communion on March 7th. I was the Celebrant. That was 266 days ago, but it feels like it’s been a few years.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve all been through a lot. On my end, while the Lord has proven faithful to provide glimpses of joy—including an addition to our family!—this has been one of the most difficult years of my life. I’ve recently decided to step away from my Ph.D. program for a year for the sake of my mental health.</p>
<p>It’s been a long year. And, I don’t know about you, but I am impatient and oh so tired.</p>
<p>As 2020 comes to a close, I’m tired of</p>
<ul>
<li>disease,</li>
<li>depression,</li>
<li>disruption,</li>
<li>deception,</li>
<li>division, and</li>
<li>death.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it’s very tempting to begin the new liturgical year today by skipping straight to Christmas and leaving all that unhappy junk behind us!</p>
<h2 id="but-advent-gets-in-our-way">But Advent gets in our way.</h2>
<p>As Fleming Rutledge puts it in her collection of Advent sermons,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the season [of Advent] is not for the faint of heart.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Why? Well, to borrow another phrase from her,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Advent begins in the dark.”</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="you-see-advent-reminds-us-that-if-were-going-to-follow-jesus-we-need-to-stay-awake-and-wait-for-him-to-returnin-the-dark">You see, Advent reminds us that, if we’re going to follow Jesus, we need to stay awake and wait for him to return—in the dark.</h2>
<p>And yes, I’ll admit that “Stay woke, people, it’s dark outside!” is a hard word for the weary. But I think it’s a good word.</p>
<p>It’s certainly a much better word than “Everything’s fine, folks! Here, have some eggnog and, you know, try not to breathe on anybody!”</p>
<p>Because, here’s the thing: when Jesus tells us to watch and wait for his return to judge the living and the dead, he’s not telling us to sit down, shut up, and keep a stiff upper lip.</p>
<p>No! There are things to do.</p>
<h2 id="and-as-our-reading-from-isaiah-reminds-us-as-we-wait-for-the-lord-its-ok-if-weve-got-something-to-say-a-hard-word-of-our-own">And, as our reading from Isaiah reminds us, as we wait for the Lord, it’s OK if we’ve got something to say. A hard word of our own.</h2>
<p>Namely: “God, where are you? Why haven’t you torn the sky open yet? Why haven’t you come back to fix things?”</p>
<p>That’s how Isaiah 64 begins. It’s actually the second half of a lament prayer that begins by recalling how God rescued his people from slavery in Egypt. (Just like we just did in our sermon series on Exodus!)</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that God’s people promptly rebelled against him before they even reached the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Then, once there, they continued to break their covenant commitments to God until they received the promised punishment of exile.</p>
<p>But Isaiah hasn’t forgotten the exodus or the covenant.</p>
<p>God has proven that he <em>can</em> save. And God has promised that he <em>will</em> save.</p>
<p>So, what gives?</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are God’s zeal and might?</li>
<li>Why is he withholding his tenderness and compassion from his people?</li>
<li>Why have enemies trampled down the sanctuary?</li>
<li>Why has God hidden his face?</li>
<li>Why has God given us over to our sins?</li>
<li>Is God going to keep silent and punish us by refusing to rescue us forever?</li>
<li>Doesn’t he know his reputation is on the line?</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait, that’s not quite right. And this is very important.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-a-lament-about-god-to-a-third-party-this-is-a-lament-to-god">This is not a lament ABOUT God to a third party. This is a lament TO God.</h2>
<p>Hard words, yes. But words spoken within the context of a relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are YOU, God?</li>
<li>We are YOUR people. Why haven’t YOU rescued us yet?</li>
<li>Don’t YOU know that YOUR reputation is at stake?</li>
</ul>
<p>Friends, if you’re feeling far away from God these days, might I suggest that you start praying this way, with brutal honesty? God knows how we really feel. Tell him! He can handle it.</p>
<h2 id="but-theres-something-else-we-need-to-be-brutally-honest-about-as-we-wait-for-the-lord-and-thats-our-own-sin">But there’s something else we need to be brutally honest about as we wait for the Lord, and that’s our own sin.</h2>
<p>Yes, as Isaiah 64:4-5 notes, God is a God who “who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.” And this means that he’s a God who comes “to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember [God’s] ways” (64:4–5).</p>
<p>Did you catch that? <strong>Waiting for God means “gladly doing right” and “remembering God’s ways” by living according to his will! We don’t “wait for God” by sitting around and twiddling our thumbs!</strong></p>
<p>But, I suppose, even thumb-twiddling would be better than what actually takes place! As Isaiah 64 goes on to describe, God’s people keep sinning despite God’s obvious anger. How, then, can we be saved?</p>
<p>Verses 6 and 7 read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away. No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and have given us over to our sins.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, biblical lament gives us the space to air our grievances to God. But we shouldn’t stop there. We should continually confess our sins to God—both individually <em>and</em> communally.</p>
<p>Do you hear how Isaiah is speaking for the people here? There’s a solidarity between the prophet and the people that I think should also characterize the Church.</p>
<p>It’s not enough as Christians to say “not my problem” or “at least I’m not as bad as so-and-so!”</p>
<p>No, instead, as we wait for the Lord, we need to ask ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I need to confess and repent of?</li>
<li>What does <em>our</em> church need to confess and repent of?</li>
<li>What does <em>the</em> church need to confess and repent of?</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, we need to consider, in the words of our collect prayer, exactly what it looks like for us to “cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light.”</p>
<p>And this is where the rubber meets the road, I think, when it comes to Jesus’s commands in Mark 13 to “Be on guard! Keep alert!” And “keep watch.”</p>
<p>He’s not talking about being paranoid, constantly checking the news, and what the kids these days are calling “doomscrolling” through Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Yes, on the one hand, we need to make sure that we’re not selfishly ignoring the real suffering around us.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, there’s a big difference between checking Twitter every hour to find out what we should be angry about and really listening to the heartbeat of the world’s pain.</p>
<p><strong>Friends, our problem isn’t that we’re starved for information and data. No, we’re starved for insight and discernment.</strong></p>
<p>So, if we’re going to read the news, we should first read our Bibles. And if we’re going to read our Bibles, we need to let the Bible read us.</p>
<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer correctly diagnosed a persistent problem when he said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We no longer read the Bible seriously. We read it no longer against ourselves but only for ourselves” (DBWE 11:377-78).</p></blockquote>
<p>This particular facet of our sinfulness is called “confirmation bias.” Whether we’re reading the Bible or Facebook, we’re looking for things that confirm what we already think, feel, and do.</p>
<p>(And, in Facebook’s case, <em>it’s</em> showing us things that we tend to agree with!)</p>
<p>As we watch and wait for the Lord, we need to push back against this. We need to let judgment begin with the household of God (1 Pet. 4:17) and lead the way for the world in terms of confession and repentance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, without the help of the Holy Spirit, we’re going to, at best, lead the way for the world in terms of self-righteousness and self-justification! Filthy rags, indeed.</p>
<h2 id="in-order-to-get-out-of-this-mess-we-desperately-need-gods-help">In order to get out of this mess, we desperately need God’s help.</h2>
<p>That’s why Isaiah is so indignant in his lament. Sure, it’s not God’s fault that we sin. But we sure can’t save ourselves!</p>
<p>As Psalm 80 reminds us, we need our Shepherd, the LORD God of Hosts, to “restore us” and “make your face to shine on us, that we may be saved.”</p>
<p>We can do our very best to keep watch, but, as Psalm 127:1 reminds us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But, of course, for Isaiah, that’s the problem! God has “hidden [his] face from us” and has “given us over to our sins” (64:7)?</p>
<p>“How then can we be saved?” (64:5)</p>
<h2 id="in-almost-every-biblical-lament-there-is-a-turn-in-isaiah-64-its-in-verses-8-9">In almost every biblical lament, there is a “turn.” In Isaiah 64, it’s in verses 8-9:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“YET you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.</p>
<p>“Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look on us, we pray, for we are all your people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>God is our Father. We are his children.</p>
<p>He may tarry, he may judge, he may allow us to experience consequences for our rebellion, but he will NOT “hold himself back” forever.</p>
<p>He will NOT “keep silent” forever and “punish us beyond measure.”</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<h2 id="because-although-were-still-awaiting-his-final-return-and-judgment-god-has-in-fact-torn-open-the-heavens-and-come-down-since-isaiahs-lament">Because, although we’re still awaiting his final return and judgment, God has, in fact, torn open the heavens and come down since Isaiah’s lament.</h2>
<p>God has not kept silent.</p>
<p>In fact, as the book of Hebrews reminds us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets [like Isaiah!] at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son” (1:1-2),</p></blockquote>
<p>…at whose baptism the heavens were torn open and the Spirit descended upon him like a dove (Mark 1:10).</p>
<p>And God has not punished us beyond measure.</p>
<p>In fact, as Isaiah 53:5 reminds us, in Christ, God himself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You see, when Jesus’s body was torn upon the cross, the curtain in the Temple was torn in two, allowing us to enter the Holy of Holies with confidence by the blood of Christ!</p>
<p>Friends, this is what gives us confidence to stay awake and wait for the Lord’s return, even when it’s dark outside.</p>
<p>So, we can be brutally honest with God and we can confess our sins with confidence, even when the sun goes dark, the moon goes dim, and the stars fall from the sky.</p>
<p>We can gladly do right and remember God’s ways, even when the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we are God’s children and God is our Father.</p>
<p>And so, we pray to Our Father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look on us, we pray, for we are all your people” (Isa. 64:9).</p>
<p>“Restore us, Lord God Almighty; make your face shine on us [in the face of your Son], that we may be saved.” (Ps. 80:19)</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Christians believe that there is one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as my daughter Eva put it recently after seeing a picture in her book, “Father, Son, and Bird.” We’re working on that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Christians have been taught that the Trinity is important. No one wants to be a heretic. Trinity, good. Modalism, bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(<a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/who-really-cares-about-the-trinity-josh-steele/">To listen to the audio of this sermon as it was preached on June 6, 2020, click here.</a>)</em></p>
<p>Christians believe that there is one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Or, as my daughter Eva put it recently after seeing a picture in her book, “Father, Son, and Bird.” We’re working on that…</p>
<p>We Christians have been taught that the Trinity is important. No one wants to be a heretic. Trinity, good. Modalism, bad.</p>
<p>But, quite frankly, who cares about the Trinity right now in 2020?</p>
<p>What difference does divine mathematics make when the world is on fire? When Black people are dying?</p>
<p>Don’t we Christians have more important things to worry about?</p>
<p>I’m tempted to just sit in silence and then skip to the creed. It sure wouldn’t be the worst Trinity sermon!</p>
<p>But friends, though I readily confess</p>
<ul>
<li>my inadequacy,</li>
<li>my anger, and</li>
<li>the inadequacy of my anger,</li>
</ul>
<p>it falls to me, a young white priest, to preach the gospel on Trinity Saturday 2020.</p>
<p>So, preach I will.</p>
<h2 id="the-trinity-and-the-bible">The Trinity and the Bible</h2>
<p>But please, bear with me! My sermon has changed a lot in recent days.</p>
<p>Originally, the whole thing was going to be about how the Trinity is not an abstract list of thoughts be thunk about God.</p>
<p>Instead, the Trinity is how the Church reads the Bible.</p>
<p>And let me just say a little bit more about that, because I think it’s really important.</p>
<p>The Church developed the doctrine of the Trinity in order to make sense of the Bible as the single story of how the one true God</p>
<ul>
<li>creates the world,</li>
<li>refuses to let it fall into nothingness due to sin,</li>
<li>redeems it through Jesus Christ and</li>
<li>brings it to perfection through the Holy Spirit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="without-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity">Without the Doctrine of the Trinity…</h2>
<p>Without the doctrine of the Trinity, the Bible falls apart into <em>fragments</em>.</p>
<p>What do we do with YHWH?</p>
<p>With God’s Spirit?</p>
<p>With God’s Son, Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>Are these <em>three</em> different gods?</p>
<p>Is just <em>one</em> of them god?</p>
<p>Are <em>none</em> of them god, but just <em>masks</em> that God wears?</p>
<p>Without the doctrine of the Trinity, at best, we’re either</p>
<ul>
<li>polytheists, who worship more than one god</li>
<li>idolaters, who worship things that God made</li>
<li>or we’re completely unsure of who the true God really is.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="with-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity">With the doctrine of the Trinity…</h2>
<p><em>With</em> the doctrine of the Trinity, however, we can trust that God is who he has revealed himself to be in Scripture and in the life of the Church—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This is God’s <em>proper name</em>.</p>
<p>With the doctrine of the Trinity, we can trust, especially in difficult times, that we worship the same God who called the world into existence and order out of nothing.</p>
<p>We worship the same God</p>
<ul>
<li>who rescued his people from slavery in Egypt.</li>
<li>who brought his people back from exile by going into exile for them at the cross.</li>
<li>who raised Jesus Christ from the grave.</li>
<li>who exalted Jesus to his right hand, where he now sits enthroned over the universe.</li>
<li>who poured out his Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and like <em>that</em>, can break down linguistic, social, and racial barriers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctrine of the Trinity reminds us that we worship the same God who, since Pentecost, has equipped and empowered his Church in every generation—through <em>persecutions</em>, <em>plagues</em>, and <em>prejudices</em>— to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything” that Jesus commanded.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="so-yes-i-think-we-should-care-about-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity-especially-in-2020">So, yes, I think we <em>should</em> care about the doctrine of the Trinity, especially in 2020.</h2>
<p>Because some Christians, especially some white Christians, seem to have forgotten that all human beings are created in the image of the Triune God.</p>
<p>All human beings are therefore worthy of <em>dignity</em>, <em>respect</em>, and <em>self-sacrifice for their well-being</em>.</p>
<p>We’re supposed to extend God’s rule and reign throughout the world as good stewards, instead of exploiting creation and other human beings for our own gain.</p>
<p>We should care about the Trinity in 2020, because some of us seem to have forgotten that the Triune God is always and everywhere in control, so we don’t need to be driven by <em>fear</em>.</p>
<p>Some of us seem to have forgotten that Jesus has “all authority in heaven and on earth,” so we don’t need to curry favor with tyrants or Trumps in order to accomplish our Great Commission.</p>
<p>We Christians should care about the Trinity in 2020 because we are image-bearers of the Triune God, commissioned to make disciples of Jesus Christ in all the diverse people groups of the world.</p>
<h2 id="now-lets-just-take-a-moment-and-ask-ourselves-how-is-that-going">Now, let’s just take a moment and ask ourselves: How is that going?</h2>
<p>Let judgment begin with the household of God!</p>
<p>How much of the chaos around us is due to a failure of the Church to make obedient disciples of Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>After all, Jesus didn’t commission us to make disciples of Fox News, or MSNBC, or even NPR!</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t command us to baptize our greed, our nationalism, or our racism in the unholy water of civil religion.</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t tell us that we only had to obey certain things that he said.</p>
<ul>
<li>He didn’t say it was OK for liberals to ignore his sexual ethic.</li>
<li>And he didn’t say it was OK for conservatives to ignore his social ethic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, speaking with the full authority of the Triune God, Jesus told us to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, obviously, I don’t think the church has ever completely failed to live out her mission, or else there wouldn’t be a church today to preach to!</p>
<p>But, brothers and sisters, as we rightly lament the current state of things, I think we need to ask ourselves if the church has failed to make disciples.</p>
<p>Disciples of Jesus are people who</p>
<ul>
<li>look,</li>
<li>think, and</li>
<li>act like Jesus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do we look, think, and act like Jesus?</p>
<p>Or do we think that Jesus looks, thinks, and acts like us?</p>
<h2 id="now-let-me-take-a-deep-breath-here-and-say-that-ive-been-preaching-at-a-much-broader-target-in-this-sermon-than-just-church-of-the-savior-in-wheaton-il">Now, let me take a deep breath here and say that I’ve been preaching at a much broader target in this sermon than just Church of the Savior in Wheaton, IL!</h2>
<p>I thank God for how he has blessed our church with godly leaders and laypeople who are willing to consider the gospel’s implications for all of life.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call our local church a nationalist church or a racist church, and I thank God for that.</p>
<h2 id="nevertheless-its-not-enough-to-congratulate-ourselves-that-were-not-as-bad-as-other-churches">Nevertheless, it’s not enough to congratulate ourselves that we’re not as bad as other churches.</h2>
<p>There is always room for growth!</p>
<p>How, then, should we live?</p>
<p>Well, SO MUCH could be said, but here’s what I think we need to focus on.</p>
<h2 id="as-image-bearers-of-the-triune-god-in-2020-we-need-to-ask-ourselves-what-it-would-look-like-to-be-and-make-disciples-of-jesus-who-take-a-stand-for-biblical-justice-against-the-systemic-sin-of-racism">As image-bearers of the Triune God in 2020, we need to ask ourselves what it would look like to be and make disciples of Jesus who take a stand for biblical justice against the systemic sin of racism.</h2>
<p>I don’t have all the answers, but I do have 3 suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="first-we-need-to-read-the-bible">First, we need to read the Bible.</h3>
<p>We need to be so thoroughly familiar with the Bible that we can explain our biblical and theological reasons for taking a stand against the systemic sin of racism.</p>
<p>Let it be known that, as Christians, we are not against racism because we’re trying to impress our liberal friends!</p>
<p>We are against racism because we’ve read our Bibles and recognized that the Triune God is against racism!</p>
<p>At minimum, the doctrine of the Trinity reminds us that God’s oneness has never meant sameness.</p>
<p>When we read the narrative of Scripture, it becomes clear that God is not colorblind, and neither should we be as we make disciples of all the <em>ethne</em>, all the people groups of the world.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to a world that desperately needs hope! Let’s not waste that opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="second-we-christians-especially-we-white-anglican-christians-need-to-familiarize-ourselves-with-the-history-of-racism-the-united-states-of-america">Second, we Christians, ESPECIALLY we white Anglican Christians, need to familiarize ourselves with the history of racism the United States of America.</h3>
<p>We can’t understand the current state of things if we are ignorant of America’s racist history and white Anglican Christians’ complicity in it.</p>
<p>Frankly, I do not know enough about this myself, so, in addition to reading our Bibles, I invite you to join me in reading books like Jemar Tisby’s <em>The Color of Compromise</em> and Ibram X. Kendi’s <em>Stamped from the Beginning</em>.</p>
<p>We also all need to read Esau McCaulley’s <em>Reading While Black</em> when it comes out in a few months!</p>
<h3 id="third-we-need-to-take-action">Third, we need to take action.</h3>
<p>Reading our Bibles and learning more about the history of racism in America are good starts. But they’re not enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to listen and learn from the example of the Black Church about what it looks like to take a biblical stand against injustice.</li>
<li>We need to develop diverse relationships.</li>
<li>We white Christians need to listen to people of color, without expecting them to solve all of our problems for us.</li>
<li>We need to raise up leaders of color within the church.</li>
<li>We need to give money to leaders of color and the ministries that they lead.</li>
<li>We need to let our bishops know that we want the Anglican Church in North America to look more like the North America we’re called to serve.</li>
<li>We need to speak up and call out racism even when it’s costly to do so and especially when it’s coming from an elected or an ordained leader.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="now-is-anyone-else-feeling-overwhelmed">Now, is anyone else feeling overwhelmed?</h2>
<p>I mean, does our church, does <em>the</em> church, have the strength to fulfill the Great Commission when things have gone so horribly wrong?</p>
<p>No, she doesn’t. And she never has.</p>
<p>But perhaps you’ve noticed that I’ve not yet quoted the last part of the Great Commission.</p>
<p>We need to hear it, though, because it’s the most important part.</p>
<h3 id="jesus-said-and-surely-i-am-with-you-always-to-the-very-end-of-the-age">Jesus said: “And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</h3>
<p>Without that promise, the Great Commission is an unbearable burden, an impossible command.</p>
<p>But <em>with</em> that promise, the Great Commission is good news, even in 2020.</p>
<p>It might not feel like it some days, but the end of the age has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t promise to be with us</p>
<ul>
<li>until COVID-19 forced us to meet online,</li>
<li>until George Floyd and countless others were murdered, or</li>
<li>until the President profaned the Word of God for a photo op.</li>
</ul>
<p>No, Jesus promised to be with us until the END.</p>
<p>Until “God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people”—his people from every tribe and tongue and nation!—“and God himself will be with them and be their God. ‘He will wipe every tear”—every tear-gassed tear!—from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”</p>
<p>Friends, this is why we should care about the Trinity!</p>
<p>If Christ is with us, then the Triune God is with us.</p>
<p>And if the Triune God is with us, then we can make disciples and not be afraid, no matter how bad things get!</p>
<p>For no one, nothing, not even the gates of Hell will prevail against Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>Amen. Amen. Amen.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sermon preached at Church of the Savior in Wheaton, IL.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to pray this week’s collect again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(Sermon preached at Church of the Savior in Wheaton, IL.)</em></p>
<p>I’d like to pray this week’s collect again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>It’s been a particularly difficult week here at Church of the Savior.</p>
<p>Since the end of the sermon last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve learned that Father Kevin’s been diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.</li>
<li>We’ve lost a founding and foundational member of this church, Marilyn Stewart.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, there are many other things that we’re carrying as individuals and as a body.</p>
<p>So, this evening, it sure feels like we gather as “those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.” The shadow of a particular death, as we mourn the loss of our beloved sister, Marilyn.</p>
<p>And so we gather tonight as those who need “the tender compassion of our God.” We need “the dawn from on high” to break upon us,” give us light, and “guide our feet into the way of peace.”</p>
<p>We need peace. We need light. We need comfort.</p>
<p>And instead we are given John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Wild-eyed, crazy-haired, locust-eating John the Baptist. God’s fiery messenger, crying out in the wilderness: “Prepare ye the way of the Lord! Repent, you brood of vipers!”</p>
<p>Nothing <em>against</em> John, of course. But, from our perspective at least, isn’t this unfortunate liturgical timing?</p>
<p>I mean, come on, John. We’re struggling here.</p>
<p>Can’t you come back another time? Maybe during Lent?</p>
<p>Right now, we need some <em>good</em> news. We need some comfort.</p>
<p>Do we really need to hear from John the Baptist right now?</p>
<h2 id="big-idea">Big Idea</h2>
<p>I think we do, and here’s why.</p>
<p>As we wait for the Lord’s return, we must also, like John the Baptist, prepare the way of the Lord in the wilderness. In darkness and the shadow of death.</p>
<p>And John reminds us that <strong>preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is not comfortable. But it is comforting.</strong></p>
<p>Preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is not comfortable. It is not characterized by comfort.</p>
<p>But preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is comforting, because it brings God’s comfort.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="first-what-does-it-mean-to-prepare-the-way-of-the-lord">First, what does it mean to “prepare the way of the Lord”?</h2>
<p>Well, it simply means to get things ready for God’s arrival.</p>
<p>But it specifically means to get a PEOPLE ready for God’s arrival.</p>
<p>We’re not talking about a literal road here that needs to be leveled and straightened and paved.</p>
<p>We’re talking about a group of people who need to get prepared for their God to arrive.</p>
<p>That’s what John the Baptist is up to. He’s getting people from the house of Israel ready to receive their Lord’s arrival as <em>good news</em> of deliverance, instead of as <em>bad news</em> of judgment.</p>
<p>The angel Gabriel said as much to John’s father, Zechariah, in Luke 1:16-17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And [John] will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God. He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. <strong>He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord.</strong> He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and he will cause those who are rebellious to accept the wisdom of the godly.</p></blockquote>
<p>And when Zechariah himself prophesied about John’s ministry, in Luke 1:76-77, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And you, my little son, will be called the prophet of the Most High, because you will prepare the way for the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p>How?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You will tell his people how to find salvation through forgiveness of their sins.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So, preparing the way of the Lord means getting people ready for God to arrive.</p>
<p>John prepared the way for our Lord Jesus Christ’s first arrival.</p>
<p>We Christians prepare the way for Lord’s second arrival, when he returns to “judge the living and the dead,” on the one hand, and to “wipe away every tear from [our] eyes” (Rev. 7:17), on the other.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-then-is-getting-people-ready-for-christs-return-not-comfortable">Why, then, is getting people ready for Christ’s return not comfortable?</h2>
<h3 id="1-because-its-done-in-the-wilderness-of-human-history">1. Because it’s done in the wilderness of human history.</h3>
<p>We prepare the way of the Lord in the midst of a world that, though it still belongs to God, has been infected and affected by sin and death at every level.</p>
<p>But when faced with such a world, the good news of Jesus Christ is not escapist. It’s not some pie-in-the-sky pipe dream that touches lightly on the carnage of human history. No!</p>
<p>Instead, the good news of Jesus Christ doubles-down on space and time, on the here and now, on flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Did you notice all those names at the beginning of our Gospel lesson? It started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar…</p></blockquote>
<p>And if all Luke wanted to do was to indicate the date, he could have stopped right there. But instead, he continues to list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pontius Pilate</li>
<li>Herod</li>
<li>Philip</li>
<li>Lysanias</li>
<li>Annas</li>
<li>Caiaphas</li>
</ul>
<p>Very real, very powerful men. Men with the very real blood of the people of God–of the Son of God!–on their hands.</p>
<p>And where does the word of God show up? To John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.</p>
<p>You see, the word of God offers us no escape from human history. It instead offers us a redemption of human history.</p>
<p>This redemption, as it turns out, includes some reversals of fortunes.</p>
<p>As Mary sang in Luke 1:52-53, when God redeems, he brings down rulers—like those 7 powerful men we just mentioned—from their thrones. But he lifts up the humble.</p>
<p>When God redeems, he fills the hungry with good things, but he sends the rich away empty.</p>
<p>As our Gospel lesson put it, quoting Isaiah 40:3-5, when God redeems, valleys are raised up, mountains are brought down, crooked roads are made straight, and rough roads are made smooth.</p>
<p>Yes! Amen! That sounds like good news! Especially when we’re humbled and hungry in the valley of the shadow of death!</p>
<p>I say we get some bulldozers and start chipping away at those mountains.</p>
<p>I say we knock some cracks into the foundations of the halls of power.</p>
<p>I say we let the Tiberiuses of this world know that their days in power are numbered.</p>
<p>But here there is a second reason why preparing the way of the Lord is uncomfortable.</p>
<h3 id="2-because-it-begins-with-us-the-people-of-god">2. Because it begins with us, the people of God.</h3>
<p>John doesn’t go to Tiberius’ palace. He doesn’t pay a visit to Pontius Pilate’s mansion.</p>
<p>He <em>does</em> speak truth to Herod’s power, which gets him thrown into prison…</p>
<p>But the summary of John’s ministry that we get in Luke 3:3 is that John tells ordinary Israelites that they need to repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of their sins.</p>
<p>Wait a second, John. I thought this was about reversal.</p>
<p><em>We’ve</em> been brought low, by Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and now Rome. Surely <em>we</em> don’t need to repent. We’re the victims here! Go tell the Romans and those Roman-loving sellouts to repent.</p>
<p>But, of course, God’s redemption involves both reversal and renewal.</p>
<p>The good news of Jesus Christ is radical in that it calls both strong and the weak, both the oppressors and the oppressed to <strong>repent</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>To turn away from sin and toward God.</li>
<li>To embrace God’s agenda by living a transformed life.</li>
</ul>
<p>You see, God doesn’t need our bulldozers. He wants our repentance and our obedience.</p>
<p>As our collect reminds us this week, if the return of Jesus is to be received as good news, it must be preceded by repentance. Otherwise, the return of the Judge is bad news for the unrepentant.</p>
<p>This reminds me of Jesus’ words in Luke 18:7-8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. <strong>However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>When Jesus returns, will he find faith on the earth?</p>
<p>Getting people ready for Christ’s return in the wilderness is not comfortable, because we have to ask ourselves that question before we ask it of anyone else.</p>
<p>And yet, I insist, preparing the way of the Lord is comforting!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-is-getting-ourselves-ready-for-christs-return-comforting">Why is getting ourselves ready for Christ’s return comforting?</h2>
<p>I find it fascinating that all four Gospels link the fiery ministry of John the Baptist with Isaiah 40.</p>
<p>Isaiah 40 is a major turning point in the book of Isaiah. Very broadly speaking, chapters 1-39 mostly contain oracles of God’s judgment.</p>
<p>And then we get to Isaiah 40, which begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comfort, comfort my people,<br>
says your God.<br>
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,<br>
and proclaim to her<br>
that her hard service has been completed,<br>
that her sin has been paid for,<br>
that she has received from the Lord’s hand<br>
double for all her sins.</p></blockquote>
<p>The “voice crying in the wilderness,” which all four Gospels say is John the Baptist, is preparing the way—getting people ready–for the arrival of God’s comfort in and through Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3 id="1-preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-brings-comfort-first-because-though-we-have-sinned-and-need-to-repent-forgiveness-is-freely-available-through-jesus-christ">1. Preparing the way of the Lord brings comfort, first, because, though we have sinned and need to repent, forgiveness is freely available through Jesus Christ.</h3>
<p>We are not saved by how well we repent. If we were, that would be very bad news. Instead, we are saved by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Turning away from sin and toward Jesus in repentance and faith might not be comfortable, but it’s comforting because he’s more worthy of our faith than we are!</p>
<p>We don’t have to run the rat race of trying to earn God’s favor and give our own lives meaning. Instead, we can cling to Jesus and find forgiveness, purpose, and value in him.</p>
<h3 id="2-preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-brings-comfort-second-because-the-wilderness-will-not-have-the-final-word">2. Preparing the way of the Lord brings comfort, second, because the wilderness will not have the final word.</h3>
<p>The word of God in the wilderness is NOT “get used to it! This is the way things are always going to be!” NO!</p>
<p>I don’t care how common they are, even in the church. Sin, death, and disease are <em>not</em> the way things are supposed to be.</p>
<p>God will not let them stand forever. He is at work against them even now, and one day he will return to to abolish them forever.</p>
<p>So, getting ourselves ready for Christ’s return is comforting, even when done through tears, because the people thus prepared are those who await the fulfillment of Revelation 7:16-17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Never again will they hunger;<br>
never again will they thirst.<br>
The sun will not beat down on them,’<br>
nor any scorching heat.<br>
For the Lamb at the center of the throne<br>
will be their shepherd;<br>
‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’<br>
‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>No more decay. No more disease. No more death.</p>
<p>That’s what we’re preparing for. And that’s why it’s comforting.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-should-we-prepare-the-way-of-the-lord-today-at-savior">How should we prepare the way of the Lord today, at Savior?</h2>
<p>How should we get ourselves ready for Christ’s return?</p>
<p>Well, Father Kevin is going to preach more about repentance based on the content of John the Baptist’s preaching next week.</p>
<p>But, in the meantime, I’ve got three pastoral suggestions based on this week’s introduction of John’s ministry.</p>
<h3 id="1-avoid-escapism-tell-the-truth-about-the-wilderness">1. Avoid escapism. Tell the truth about the wilderness.</h3>
<p>Maybe I’m just speaking to myself here, but it seems like one of the easiest approaches to the suffering we’re enduring here at Savior would be to ignore it. Put a smile on.</p>
<p>How are you doing? Fine. You? Fine. Everybody’s “fine.”</p>
<p>Nope. That’s not how the church is supposed to behave in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Instead, let’s be honest with God and with each other about the wilderness in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p>How are you doing? Honestly. How are you really doing?</p>
<p>Maybe instead of saying “fine,” you should tell the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m lonely.</li>
<li>I’m afraid.</li>
<li>I’m overwhelmed.</li>
<li>I’m angry.</li>
<li>I don’t understand why God is allowing this to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Friends, if the gospel tells us anything, it tells us that things right now are not the way they’re supposed to be.</p>
<p>And, if we can’t be honest about that here, in the church, what hope do we have?</p>
<p>Yes, we should be grateful. Yes, we should be hopeful.</p>
<p>But we also need to be unflinchingly truthful. Especially in difficult seasons like the one we’re in right now.</p>
<h3 id="2-radically-resist-busyness-and-hurry">2. Radically resist busyness and hurry.</h3>
<p>If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s one of our stated values here at Savior. It’s baked into the culture of this church.</p>
<p>But I bring it up again because of the temptation that I mentioned earlier to grab a bulldozer and try to level the mountains on our own.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that the gospel shouldn’t lead us to oppose the effects of sin and death in the world around us. It should!</p>
<p>But we can’t allow mere activism to replace the uncomfortable work of examination and repentance.</p>
<p>When the going gets tough, it’s often easier to lose ourselves in our work—perhaps especially when it’s “kingdom work”!—than it is to stop and tell the truth about how we’re doing.</p>
<p>Confession and repentance are both more difficult and less comfortable than volunteering, giving, and even preaching.</p>
<p>So, let’s not use getting lost in the “Lord’s work” as an excuse for avoiding the Lord’s word.</p>
<h3 id="3-lead-the-way-in-repentance-by-preaching-the-gospel-to-ourselves-daily">3. Lead the way in repentance by preaching the gospel to ourselves daily.</h3>
<p>It might not be comfortable, but God’s comforting word to us in the wilderness is that we are sinners and we need to repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of our sins.</p>
<p>We need to turn away from sin and toward our forgiving and comforting God.</p>
<p>We need to be united through baptism into Christ’s death, that we might experience the new life of his resurrection.</p>
<p>And, here’s the thing, we never outgrow our baptism. But we often need to return to it.</p>
<p>We never outgrow our need to hear the gospel, repent, and cling to Jesus. But we often need to be reminded of it.</p>
<p>So let’s remind ourselves. Let’s remind each other.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Like I said earlier, right now, this week, at Church of the Savior in Wheaton, IL, we need some good news.</p>
<p>We need some comfort.</p>
<p>We need to hear from John the Baptist, because he points us to Jesus.</p>
<p>And the good news of Jesus Christ might be uncomfortable, but it’s the only source of true comfort in the wilderness, in the darkness, and in the shadow of death.</p>
<p>So, like John the Baptist, let’s prepare the way of the Lord.</p>
<p>Let’s get a people ready for Christ’s return by getting ourselves ready, every day, to repent and cling to Jesus for forgiveness and comfort we so desperately need.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Would you pray with me?</p>
<p><strong>O God, because without you we are not able to please you—especially in what we say!—mercifully grant that your Holy Spirit may in all things direct and rule our hearts, so that the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts might be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, our strength and our redeemer. Amen.</strong></p>
<p>Well, friends, I’ve gotta say that, although it’s a pleasure to be here with you this morning, it honestly freaks me out a little bit to preach at a church I’ve never been to before, when the New Testament reading begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. For all of us make many mistakes.”!</p></blockquote>
<p>The insecure perfectionist in me wants to shut up and sit down before I say something wrong! Maybe we should just read the rest of the book of James and call it a day.</p>
<p>But, of course, James’ warning makes sense. Christian teachers <em>ought</em> to be judged with greater strictness, because, to put it simply, words matter—especially when we’re talking about who God is, what God has done, and what it means to live as God’s people.</p>
<p>Although headlines these days might lead us to believe that you can say absolutely anything—no matter how ridiculous or offensive—without suffering lasting consequences, James reminds us that God cares about what you say! Even what you say online, I might add!</p>
<p>Of course, this is somewhat unfortunate because, as James also reminds us, it is so much easier to talk your way <em>into</em> trouble than <em>out of</em> it!</p>
<p>It’s very easy to say the self-serving thing, the dishonest thing, the inflammatory thing.</p>
<p>It’s much more difficult to say the true thing, the loving thing, the wise thing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because, as James reminds us,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell…</p>
<p>…no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the tongue is a relatively small part of the human body, just like bits in a horse’s mouth or the rudder of a ship, it can produce some some pretty big changes.</p>
<p>What we say and how we say it can completely change the course of our lives and the lives of others around us. And a <em>careless</em> word spoken to a parent, a spouse, a child, or a friend can ruin lives.</p>
<p>And, here’s the kicker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With [the tongue] we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.</p>
<p>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing.</p>
<p>My brothers, these things ought not to be so.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but that last part makes me even more nervous.</p>
<p>God doesn’t just care what we say to or about him. God also cares about what we say to or about other people, his image-bearers!</p>
<p>And, if I’m honest, this puts me to shame when I think about how much more time and effort I put into choosing my words carefully in a sermon, compared to how careless I often am when speaking to people who were created in the image of God.</p>
<p>Sure, I still make mistakes in the sermons! But at least I <em>try</em> to think through a sermon.</p>
<p>Yet, I’ll often lash-out at someone without a second thought!</p>
<p>Whether you’ve ever preached before or not, I trust you’ve been there, too.</p>
<p>We’ve all said some things we later regretted. We’ve all learned that it’s easier to talk yourself into trouble than out of it.</p>
<h2 id="main-point">Main Point</h2>
<p>My main point this morning is, I think, rather simple to understand. But it’s very difficult to live.</p>
<p>It’s this: The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<p>The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<p>Our passage from James has already reminded us that taming the tongue—being wise and controlled in how you communicate—is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>And James has convicted us that, even though it’s difficult, there’s no excuse for using our tongues to praise God one moment and then to trash the people God has made the next.</p>
<p>This leaves us in a bit of a bind! At least we’re not alone.</p>
<h2 id="mark-827-38">Mark 8:27-38</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at our Gospel text in Mark 8.</p>
<p>When Jesus asks his disciples in Mark chapter 8 verse 29 “who do you say that I am?,” Peter hits a home run and says, straight-up, “You are the Christ.”</p>
<p>That is, “you are the Messiah.”</p>
<p>That is, “you are God’s promised deliverer of his people, you are the savior-king that we’ve been waiting for.”</p>
<p>And, look at that! Here’s a bit of good news: by the grace of God, human speech can be accurate! It can even be used to accomplish God’s will in the world (just read Peter’s later letters).</p>
<p>But, of course, things quickly go downhil for Peter. In Mark’s telling of the story, the next thing Peter does is talk himself into trouble. He takes Jesus aside and rebukes him for Jesus’ clear teaching about his upcoming suffering, death, and resurrection.</p>
<p>Now, this isn’t the exact same as “cursing” Jesus. It was probably more of a reprimand, like: “Jesus, what are you talking about? If you’re the Messiah, you’re not going to suffer and die. You’re going to conquer! And we’re going to conquer with you!”</p>
<p>Still, even by the disciples’ standards in the Gospels, rebuking Jesus is pretty bad. Peter earns himself the stunning rebuke from Jesus in verse 33:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking to the crowd and his disciples, in verse 34 and 35, Jesus then says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</p>
<p>For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, “no pain, no gain!”</p>
<p>Peter was wrong. The Messiah will be victorious, even over death itself! But he would suffer first.</p>
<p>If we want to experience the joy and the glory of Jesus’ resurrection, there’s no other way to get there than to take up our cross and follow him through his cross.</p>
<p>What does it mean to take up your cross and follow Jesus?</p>
<p>It means that following Jesus requires a painful death. Sometimes, a literal death of martyrdom!</p>
<p>But first and foremost following Jesus requires a death to ourselves and our selfish desires. To take up your cross is to deny yourself.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are many different ways to take up your cross and follow Jesus in every single area of your life.</p>
<p>This morning, I’d like to focus on what this looks like when it comes to communication.</p>
<p>And I’d like to suggest that the only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<p>The only way to be wise and controlled in how you communicate is to die to yourself for Jesus’ sake and for the gospel’s sake.</p>
<p>So, we must deny ourselves in order to tame our tongues when we speak to God and to God’s image-bearers.</p>
<p>This is because self-interest is at the root of all foolish and undisciplined speech!</p>
<p>Think about it, every stupid thing we’ve ever said can be traced back to our desires to get ahead!</p>
<p>Self-restraint and trying harder are not enough.</p>
<p>Only the self-denial that follows Jesus to the cross will allow Jesus to set us free from our selfish desires.</p>
<p>The good news is that, although the human tongue is, to use the technical theological term, <em>jacked-up</em> by sin, it is not beyond being saved and used by God.</p>
<p>Rescued by Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit, we can be set free to glorify God the Father by loving God and loving others, especially in how we communicate.</p>
<p>The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-that-look-like-though">What does that look like, though?</h2>
<p>Admittedly, the passage we read from James today doesn’t give us much to go on as far as how to apply these things to our lives today.</p>
<p>Instead, the main point of James 3:1-12 is that, although it’s incredibly difficult to control what you say, it still makes absolutely no sense to bless God and curse the human beings God has made.</p>
<p>The implied point of the passage is that we should not do that. Instead, we should both bless God and bless God’s image-bearers.</p>
<p>That is, in addition to praising God for who he is and what he has done, we should communicate with others for their good and well-being, instead of for our own selfish interests.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>Well, let me offer some suggestions from the book of James as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="first-as-our-passage-implies-we-need-to-realize-that-whenever-we-are-communicating-with-another-person-we-are-either-talking-to-god-or-to-one-of-gods-image-bearers">First, as our passage implies, we need to realize that, whenever we are communicating with another person, we are either talking to God or to one of God’s image-bearers.</h3>
<p>Though it might seem mundane and unimportant, our daily communication with God’s image-bearers is a huge area of our life in which we either obey or disobey Jesus’ command to deny ourselves, take up our crosses, and follow him.</p>
<p>With our speech, we’re always either building people up in selfless love or tearing them down in selfish pride. (Or, on our good days, we’re manipulating them with flattery.)</p>
<p>We need to take a similar kind of care when we’re talking to God and to God’s image-bearers.</p>
<p>As James seems to focus on later in chapter 4, this should start within the church, by refusing to speak evil of our brothers and sisters in Christ.</p>
<p>But then, of course, this should overflow outside the church, by communicating with every human being we encounter for their benefit.</p>
<p>Now, as Jesus himself modeled for us, this “speaking the truth in love” will sometimes involve speaking uncomfortable truths. But there is a difference between doing this for others’ benefit—even if it makes them unhappy—and doing so for your own benefit.</p>
<p>Telling the difference between speaking hard truths in love and speaking them in self-interest requires wisdom.</p>
<h3 id="second-we-need-to-pray">Second, we need to pray.</h3>
<p>As James 1:5 puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Given how difficult it is to tame our tongues, we should regularly ask God for the wisdom and the ability to communicate in a way that blesses him and his image-bearers.</p>
<p>It could be as simple as praying the last verse of Psalm 19 each morning before leaving the house (or leaving your bed):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.”</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="third-we-need-to-slow-down-and-calm-down-in-our-communication">Third, we need to slow down and calm down in our communication.</h3>
<p>Consider James 1:19-20:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We should tape those verses to every screen in our lives.</p>
<p>We need to realize that the 24-hour news cycle, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are all conditioning us to disobey God.</p>
<p>They are training us to be slow to listen, or to only listen to those with extreme positions that we agree with.</p>
<p>They are training us to be quick to speak.</p>
<p>And they are certainly training us to be quick to anger.</p>
<p>What in our lives is training us in the other direction? Toward wisdom? Toward the righteousness of God?</p>
<p>How much time do we spend being pulled in either direction?</p>
<p>Perhaps we need to pray for the wisdom and the ability to turn off the TV and log off Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="finally-we-need-to-back-up-our-words-with-our-actions">Finally, we need to back up our words with our actions.</h3>
<p>Taming the tongue doesn’t just mean not saying anything bad. And it doesn’t just mean saying good things. It also includes speaking in a way that is consistent with your behavior.</p>
<p>James 1:22 tells us to “be doers of the word, and not hearers only.”</p>
<p>James 1:26-27 sees right through our pretensions and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person’s religion is worthless.</p>
<p>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>As James 2:14-17 puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?</p>
<p>If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?</p></blockquote>
<p>Saying the words “go in peace, be warmed and filled” to a poor hungry person is not wrong.</p>
<p>Doing so without doing the works of warming and filling them is.</p>
<p>True faith in Jesus Christ shows itself in both words and works.</p>
<p>The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>So, Father, we ask that you would send your Holy Spirit to give us the wisdom and the ability to bless you and your image-bearers in how we communicate. Redeemed by his blood, may we display your Son’s self-sacrificial love in what we say and how we live. Amen.</strong></p>

<h2 id="goodbyes-suck">GOODBYES SUCK</h2>
<p>You know, if there’s one thing I hate, it’s goodbyes. Anyone else here hate goodbyes?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the fact that I hate them so much means I’m not really very good at goodbyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get awkward and silent. Sometimes I get awkward and really chatty! Heck, sometimes I get awkward and I make poor choices, like the one time when I was getting ready to say goodbye to my family when they dropped me off at college.</p>
<p>They were looking forward to a final dinner with me, in the school cafeteria, before they left. But I was worried about the awkwardness of saying a tearful goodbye between packed tables and chairs, so I suggested that they just leave.</p>
<p>Let’s just say that my family wasn’t very happy. And me? Neither was I. I ate my first college meal all alone.</p>
<p>Goodbyes suck. And I often suck at goodbyes.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, this is my “goodbye” sermon here at St. Peter’s, and I wanted to give an excuse for this sermon, if it sucks!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I do want to thank this congregation for being such a good place for Rachel and me to serve and grow alongside you. Thank you for loving Rachel and me as our brothers and sisters in Christ. We will miss you all very much as we move to Illinois this week.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don’t want this goodbye to get TOO awkward, so I’d better keep on preaching!</p>
<p><strong>I think that goodbyes are bad because they so often leave our stories unfinished.</strong></p>
<p>And we humans tend to hate unfinished business. It’s so much better when the story has an end! Sometimes, even a bad ending is better than no ending at all!</p>
<p>Think about it, if you’re watching an important game on TV – say, Alabama vs. Auburn – would you rather see the ending, even if your team loses, or have the power go out and completely miss the final minutes?</p>
<p>Stories without endings are frustrating. And that’s why it’s so hard to say goodbye.</p>
<p>That’s why Death – the ultimate goodbye, if you will – is so horrible.</p>
<p>It’s not really an ending, not for those of us who go on living, anyways. Instead, Death leaves our stories hanging, with words left unsaid and promises left unfulfilled.</p>
<p>I think here of parents in Manchester this week who were forced to say goodbye to their children all too soon, thanks to the suicide bombing. Or the Coptic Christians in Egypt forced to say goodbye to their loved ones too soon, thanks to the bus attack.</p>
<p>Goodbyes suck, because they leave our stories unfinished.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-ascension-does-it-suck">WHAT ABOUT THE ASCENSION? DOES IT SUCK?</h2>
<p>Is the Ascension of Jesus Christ, then, just another awful goodbye?</p>
<p>I mean, think about the emotional rollercoaster Christ’s followers must have ridden in those days. Rising hopes of God’s coming kingdom dashed to the ground at the Crucifixion – only to rise once more at the Resurrection!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jesus, you’re alive! Surely, surely now’s the time when you’re going to restore the kingdom to Israel, right?!</p>
<p>“I mean, you had us worried there for a minute, what with the whole executed like a common criminal thing… but SURELY now’s the time!</p>
<p>“Seize the day! Take the throne! Kill these Romans, won’t you?! Won’t you?!”</p></blockquote>
<p>… Now, I’m sure that the Ascension was glorious. After all, Luke tells us that the disciples worshiped and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</p>
<p>But the Ascension was still a goodbye.</p>
<p>And I’m sure that, eventually, the glory faded as the disciples gazed into heaven. And they needed the angels’ reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Men of Galilee, who do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven” [Acts 1:11].</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, so maybe it’s fairer to say that the Ascension was a “see-you-later.”</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>But doesn’t the Ascension still leave things hanging?</p>
<p>Doesn’t it still leave our story – and the story of the Gospel – unfinished?</p>
<p>Well, yes…and no.</p>
<p>If I might paraphrase the angels’ message in Acts 1 as the title of my sermon, here it is:</p>
<p><strong>“It’s finished! So, get to work!”</strong></p>
<p>And here’s my main point:</p>
<p><strong>The Ascension completes the Gospel and compels the Church.</strong></p>
<h1 id="how-does-the-ascension-complete-the-gospel">HOW DOES THE ASCENSION COMPLETE THE GOSPEL?</h1>
<p>How does the Ascension complete the Gospel?</p>
<p>Well, that requires knowing what the Gospel is, so here goes:</p>
<h2 id="the-gospel">THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In the beginning, God created the entire universe to be his temple, his kingdom – the place where he would dwell and rule.</p>
<p>And he created human beings – his image-bearers, his ambassadors, his “middle-management” – to extend his rule and reign throughout creation.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this, however, human beings rebelled against God.</p>
<p>Instead of bowing the knee to the King, they tried to steal his throne.</p>
<p>And this rebellion brought Sin and Death into the kingdom – breaking the relationships</p>
<ul>
<li>between God and humanity,</li>
<li>between humanity and itself,</li>
<li>and between humanity and the rest of creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where once there was perfect fellowship and communion, there was now distance and Exile.</p>
<p>And the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, God was not going to let Sin, Death, and Exile have the final word! No!</p>
<p>He would pursue his people, he would buy them back from their slavery to Sin and Death, he would cleanse them from the inside out, and he would – one day – bring them back home.</p>
<p>The story of God’s rescue mission, then, is the Good News – it’s the Gospel.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the story of Israel is the beginning of this rescue mission.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, God draws a people back into covenant relationship with himself.</p>
<p>And yet, the story of the Old Testament is left hanging on a tragic note.</p>
<p>Despite God’s continuing goodness, faithfulness, and salvation, his people prove stubbornly faithless.</p>
<p>And, even though they technically dwell in the geographical Promised Land, they are still in Exile.</p>
<p>They are still ruled, in the halls of power, by their political enemies. And they are still ruled, in their hearts, by Sin and Death.</p>
<p>And the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, in the New Testament, God HIMSELF goes into Exile INSTEAD OF his people, in order to bring them back home.</p>
<p>I’d like you to picture this as a capital letter “V”.</p>
<p>Up here, you’ve got the eternal Son of God – fully divine.</p>
<p>Down here, is us. Drowning, as it were, in a cesspool of Sin and Death.</p>
<p>And instead of abandoning us…</p>
<p>(Heck, even instead of somehow saving us at an arm’s distance, after we start to clean up and get our act together.)</p>
<p>…Christ dives headfirst into the muck – into the cesspool of sin-stained human existence.</p>
<p>We call this the Incarnation.</p>
<p>So, great! God’s with us! In..this…cesspool! …Great?</p>
<p>At the Crucifixion, Jesus goes all the way to the very bottom point of that capital V.</p>
<p>He goes all the way into the furthest, farthest Exile – Death.</p>
<p>So, great! God’s dead.</p>
<p>How is this good news?!</p>
<p>Well, the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, he went into the farthest Exile, so that we wouldn’t have to.</p>
<p>And he didn’t stay in the grave. No no no!</p>
<p>There’s another side to the capital V!</p>
<p>We can’t forget the Resurrection!</p>
<p>Jesus arose from the grave – he walked out of that tomb on Easter morning AAAAANNNNND…..</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Well, we don’t know.</p>
<p>He appeared to some people. And then, well, we’re not really sure what happened to him.</p>
<p>We’re not really sure what it all meant.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The story would have ended there, left hanging between tragedy and triumph, were it not for the Ascension.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-ascension-completes-the-gospel">HOW THE ASCENSION COMPLETES THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we can’t forget the Ascension!</p>
<p>The Ascension COMPLETES the Gospel!</p>
<p>The Ascension is the final step in Christ’s return from Exile.</p>
<p>And, if we are united with Christ as a part of his body, the Church, the Ascension is the completion of OUR return from Exile as well!</p>
<p>The Ascension demonstrates that the Crucifixion and Resurrection were the final victory over Sin and Death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that Christ is not only crucified, and not only risen, but also ascended, and glorified, and seated on his heavenly throne means that he is the LORD.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, though still fully human, though still fully acquainted with our many griefs, is not your buddy.</p>
<p>He’s not your pal that you can ignore at your convenience.</p>
<p>No, the Ascension reminds us that Christ is our King.</p>
<p>He is our Lord. And he is to be obeyed.</p>
<p>But, hey, since the capital V is finished, and Christ is on the throne, that means that we can all just sit around and do nothing, right?!</p>
<p>As long as we’re not doing something horrible?</p>
<p>I mean, the story’s OVER! I thought that’s what you just said, Josh.</p>
<p>No, not quite!</p>
<p>The Ascension does complete the Gospel – as its goal and culmination.</p>
<p>We will all one day be with Christ at the Father’s right hand in glory.</p>
<p>But the story’s not over, because the Ascension also compels the Church.</p>
<p>The Ascension completes the Gospel, and it also compels the Church.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-the-ascension-compel-the-church">HOW DOES THE ASCENSION COMPEL THE CHURCH?</h1>
<p>How does the Ascension compel the Church?</p>
<p>Well, <strong>the Ascension gives the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>its global mission,</strong></li>
<li><strong>its enduring hope,</strong></li>
<li><strong>and its enabling power.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone with me so far?</p>
<p>We’ve talked about the Ascension’s theological significance, how the Ascension completes the Gospel.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the Ascension’s application to our lives – how the Ascension should both challenge us and encourage us.</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-global-mission">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS GLOBAL MISSION</h2>
<p>Here’s the challenge of the Ascension: it gives the Church its global mission.</p>
<p>As Luke told us twice today – in the book of Acts and the Gospel which bears his name – Jesus commissioned his followers as witnesses who were to proclaim the Good News across cultural and ethnic boundaries.</p>
<p>“to all nations” – that word, “nations,” ethnoi, more properly refers to people groups, to cultural and ethnic groups of people, than to modern nation states.</p>
<p>That is, there are plenty of ethnoi represented right here in the United States – including those that haven’t yet heard the gospel!</p>
<p>You remember what I said a minute ago about Jesus not being our buddy?</p>
<p>He’s our King! He’s to be obeyed!</p>
<p>And he wants us to proclaim the gospel to the entire world.</p>
<p>Which, let’s be honest, is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because God’s global gospel runs counter to the nationalistic, tribalistic, and individualistic “gospels” of this earth.</p>
<p>The Good News of God’s global kingdom – won not through self-promotion or military conquest but through self-sacrifice and loving one’s enemies – this gospel runs counter to the false gospels of this world, including the false gospel of the American Dream.</p>
<p>And that cuts right across the grain of the entire political landscape – red state and blue state.</p>
<p>Now to be sure, hear me!, there is a difference between globalism and God’s global gospel.</p>
<p>But there is also a stark difference between the United States of America and the Kingdom of God – between American culture and Kingdom culture.</p>
<p>Let us, then, take heed, lest we American Christians make assimilation to American culture an unofficial prerequisite for the nations of the world.</p>
<p>There is no prerequisite.</p>
<p>There is no response of the world that gives the Church an excuse to abandon its global mission.</p>
<p>In light of the Ascension, the Church’s global mission is to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ across all cultural and ethnic boundaries – obeying its Ascended Lord, who once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” [Matt. 5:43-44].</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, so this transcultural, enemy-loving gospel stuff sounds great hypothetically, but</p>
<ul>
<li>what about when people blow themselves up to kill children at a concert in Manchester?</li>
<li>What about when people open fire on a bus full of Coptic Christians on their way to pray?</li>
<li>What about when they go on shooting sprees in shopping malls, movie theaters, schools, and churches?</li>
<li>Or what about when people are just so different, so unfamiliar, so awkward, that we just don’t know what to say?</li>
</ul>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>Do we throw up our hands in despair?</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-enduring-hope">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS ENDURING HOPE</h2>
<p>Here’s the encouragement of the Ascension: it gives the Church its enduring hope.</p>
<p>Without the Ascension, we are left wondering whether the good news of Christ’s resurrection will extend to us.</p>
<p>We are left wondering whether the chaos in the world around us will ever cease.</p>
<p>How long, O Lord? How long before you stay the hand of the wicked?</p>
<p>How long before you destroy the earthly powers and dominions and authorities that divide us and destroy us?</p>
<p>Friends, we can still ask these questions today, but it makes all the difference in the world that Christ has ascended.</p>
<p>It makes all the difference in the world that Christ has been enthroned over all earthly powers and dominions and authorities.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the Ascension shows that Christ has triumphed over his enemies.</p>
<p>The way of the Cross has won out over the sinful ways of this world.</p>
<p>And the Ascension also anticipates the second coming of Christ.</p>
<p>Just like Jesus did not stay in the grave, he will not stay at a distance upon his heavenly throne – present in the Church only sacramentally.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>And just like he did not let Sin and Death have the final word, he will not let the servants of Sin and Death have the final word, either.</p>
<p>Instead, he will one day stay the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p>He will one day disarm and destroy those who have decided to persist in rebellion against him.</p>
<p>Christ is enthroned over all earthly powers! This is our enduring hope!</p>
<p>There’s no reason for us to hedge our bets, as it were, by bending the knee to any earthly power – friend or foe.</p>
<p>Instead, the Church can freely exist for the sake of the world, because we know that the world is in the hands of our ascended King.</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-enabling-power-the-holy-spirit">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS ENABLING POWER: THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>So, you know, just get out there and try harder to love people and let them know about Jesus, no matter how different they are!</p>
<p>Right?!</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>We’re not fooling anyone. We can’t do this on our own.</p>
<p>Sure, we’ve got a global mission. And sure, we’ve got an enduring hope.</p>
<p>But we still need enabling power.</p>
<p>And the Ascension gives the Church its enabling power: the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>At the end of Luke’s Gospel, Jesus tells his disciples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high” [Luke 24:53].</p></blockquote>
<p>And, at the beginning of Acts, Jesus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, ‘you heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now” [Acts 1:4-5].</p></blockquote>
<p>A few verses later, Jesus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” [Acts 1:8].</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I know I’m getting a bit ahead of myself.</p>
<p>After all, it’s still a week until Pentecost!</p>
<p>But, brothers and sisters, we can’t make it, not even for a week, without the Holy Spirit!</p>
<p>We are only gathered here this morning, some two thousand years since the Ascension, on the other side of the world, because the Holy Spirit has empowered the Church to fulfill its global mission.</p>
<p>And, even though we live in a divided, divisive, and terrifying world, the Holy Spirit can empower the Church today.</p>
<p>So, thanks be to God that the Ascension and Pentecost go hand in hand!</p>
<h3 id="the-ascension-completes-the-gospel-and-compels-the-church-to-fulfill-its-global-mission-clinging-to-its-enduring-hope-empowered-by-the-holy-spirit">THE ASCENSION COMPLETES THE GOSPEL AND COMPELS THE CHURCH TO FULFILL ITS GLOBAL MISSION, CLINGING TO ITS ENDURING HOPE, EMPOWERED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h3>
<p>So, Father, we thank you for your persistence and patience to rescue us from Sin and Death.</p>
<p>Jesus, we bow the knee and worship you, our Ascended Lord. And we ask you to come again soon and make all things new.</p>
<p>And Holy Spirit, we ask you come. Give us the strength to love our neighbors and our enemies by proclaiming and living the gospel.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The whole idea of a criminal’s last meal affects me deeply. Why?
<p>I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.</p>
<p>While Jesus of Nazareth was no common criminal, his so-called “Last Supper” with his disciples was a poignant combination of the expected and the unexpected. And when you take a look at the Last Supper, focusing on its unexpected elements, you find out that it’s really a Lasting Supper.</p>
<p>That is, the Last Supper is not just a one-time event, some two-thousand years ago. Instead, Holy Communion, the Lasting Supper, is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.</p>
<h1 id="the-meal"><strong>The Meal</strong></h1>
<p>First, let’s look at the original meal itself, the “Last Supper,” as described in our Gospel lesson (Luke 22:14-20).</p>
<h2 id="passover-an-interpretive-celebration">Passover: An Interpretive Celebration</h2>
<p>Now, as expected, the Passover was an interpretive celebration, because it looked back to the Exodus event – when God rescued his people from slavery in Egypt – in order to explain what salvation looked like.</p>
<p>That is, if you asked any respectable Hebrew what it meant to “be saved,” you would much more likely hear “it’s like when God saved us from Egypt” than “you get to go to heaven after you die.”</p>
<p>Although Passover originated with Exodus 12’s instructions for a hasty meal, eaten while standing a fully dressed, by Jesus’ time the meal had evolved into an elaborate affair.</p>
<p>As best we can tell, in Jesus’ day the meal was structured around four cups of wine. According to New Testament scholar Joel Green, the meal had the following outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>The head of the family would pronounce a blessing over the first cup of wine, which was then shared.</li>
<li>Before the second cup, the youngest son would ask the father questions about what made this night special.</li>
<li>The father would reply by telling the Exodus story, focusing on the summary given in Deut. 26:5-11.</li>
<li>The dinner party would then sing Psalm 113, and then drink the second cup of wine.</li>
<li>The father would then bless, break, and distribute the unleavened bread, followed by the main meal.</li>
<li>Finally, they would consume two more cups of wine, before singing Psalms 114-118.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>Because we need to realize that the Passover was no ordinary meal.</p>
<p>Instead, it was an interpretive meal. Words went right along with the food, in order to situate the dinner party in the midst of God’s ongoing Story of Salvation.</p>
<p>Especially given the combination of the Exodus story with the prayers and praises found in Psalms 113-118, the Passover was</p>
<ul>
<li>a remembrance of God’s past deliverance,</li>
<li>a celebration of God’s present faithfulness,</li>
<li>and an anticipation of God’s future deliverance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The past, the present, and the future came together in one meal.</p>
<p>Here’s the framework, or the timeline, if you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original Passover meal (Exod. 12)</li>
<li>The Exodus from Egypt</li>
<li>The establishment of the Covenant</li>
<li>Yearly remembrance of the Passover</li>
<li>In hope of future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>Got that?</p>
<p>Passover, Exodus, Covenant, Remembrance, Hope.</p>
<p>OK, so this is really important: Israel didn’t merely remember the Passover each year to <em><strong>know</strong></em> something but in order to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>change</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>In other words, Passover was supposed to be a transformative remembrance.</p>
<p>Remembering God’s faithfulness was supposed to transform them into God’s faithful followers. Remembering God’s faithfulness was supposed to transform them into God’s faithful covenant partners.</p>
<p>So much for the expected aspects of the Last Supper: it was an interpretive Passover.</p>
<h2 id="an-unexpected-paradigm-shift">An Unexpected Paradigm Shift</h2>
<p>What is unexpected about this meal is how Jesus shifts the paradigm! He takes the whole “Passover, Exodus, Covenant, Remembrance, Hope” timeline and makes himself the center of it!</p>
<p>As the “head of the household,” it’s not strange that Jesus would be the chief speaker during this Passover Meal. However, in vv. 15-16, things start to get weird. Jesus frames the meal as his last meal, prophetically looking forward to his suffering and death.</p>
<p>And yet, perhaps it’s better to say his “second-to-last meal,” because in verses 16 – 18, he predicts that death will not have the final word. Instead, he will partake of the full and final Passover again in the coming kingdom of God!</p>
<p>Remember, we’re expecting Jesus to give an explanation and interpretation of the Exodus story. When Jesus takes the bread and the wine, we expect him to say: “do this in remembrance of the Exodus from Egypt…do this in remembrance of the Covenant.”</p>
<p>Instead, he says: “do this in remembrance of ME!”</p>
<p>This shifts the timeline forward, from Israel’s transformative remembrance of the Passover to the Church’s transformative remembrance of the fulfillment of the Passover, the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>Passover points to the Lord’s Supper, Holy Communion.</p>
<h2 id="new-exodus-new-covenant">New Exodus, New Covenant</h2>
<p>What about the Exodus and the Covenant? Do they point to anything?</p>
<p>They do!</p>
<p>Both the Exodus and the Covenant are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, through the New Exodus and the New Covenant!</p>
<p>In the original Exodus, God saved his people, through Moses, from slavery in Egypt.</p>
<p>In the New Exodus, God saves his people, through Jesus Christ, from slavery to Sin and Death.</p>
<p>In the original Covenant, God gives his people the Law, through Moses, written upon tablets of stone.</p>
<p>In the New Covenant, God gives his people the Law, the Gospel! through Jesus Christ, and writes it upon their hearts.</p>
<p>We see this first in Jesus’ unexpected words about the bread, interpreted as Christ’s battered body.</p>
<p>Look at verse 19. Instead of the expected words about the Passover lamb at this point in the meal, Luke speaks only of Christ’s body, sacrificially “given” for the sake of his disciples.</p>
<p>Then, in verse 20, there are Jesus’ even more shocking words about the cup, which is interpreted as New Covenant blood!</p>
<p>Because the Jews were strictly prohibited from consuming blood (Deut. 12:16, 23-4), there were probably quite a few audible sputters when Christ declared: “this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood” (Luke 22:20)!</p>
<p>Jesus is claiming that, just as the Old Covenant was ratified by blood (see Exod. 24:8), his impending death will ratify the New Covenant of Jeremiah 31:31-34. The sacrifice will be God himself, upon the Cross!</p>
<p>And, according to Jeremiah 31, the New Covenant will bring</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of God,</li>
<li>loyalty to God, and</li>
<li>forgiveness of sins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yahweh says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.</p>
<p>And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord.</p>
<p>For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more” (Jer. 31:33-34).</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="passover-and-holy-communion-an-expanded-timeline">Passover and Holy Communion: An Expanded Timeline</h2>
<p>So, to review, the previous timeline was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original Passover</li>
<li>Original Exodus</li>
<li>Establishment of the Covenant</li>
<li>Israel’s Remembrance in Passover meals</li>
<li>Hope for future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the church’s timeline builds upon the previous one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original Last Supper</li>
<li>New Exodus (accomplished at Cross)</li>
<li>New Covenant (accomplished at Cross)</li>
<li>Church’s Remembrance in Holy Communion</li>
<li>Hope for future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>In Holy Communion, we Christians are called to the transformative remembrance of what Christ has accomplished at the Cross.</p>
<p>But we don’t just look back to the Cross. We also look forward to what Jesus will accomplish at the final redemption. You know, when he returns to judge the living and the dead, to right every wrong, and to wipe away every tear!</p>
<p>When we take Holy Communion, we await the heavenly banquet that will fully fulfill both the Passover and the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>Everyone with me so far?</p>
<p>Just as Passover was designed to be a transformative remembrance, to shape the Israelites into faithful followers of God, so too Holy Communion is a transformative remembrance.</p>
<p>It’s meant to transform us into faithful followers of Jesus Christ, faithful members of Christ’s body, the Church!</p>
<h1 id="what-does-transformative-remembrance-look-like">What Does Transformative Remembrance Look Like?</h1>
<p>But, what does that look like?</p>
<p>Sure, I’ve mentioned that the New Covenant is meant to result in</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of God,</li>
<li>loyalty to god,</li>
<li>and the forgiveness of sins.</li>
</ul>
<p>But seriously: What does that look like?</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at the rest of our passage, Luke 22:21-30.</p>
<p>Is anyone else confused by how quickly the scene seems to change?</p>
<p>I mean, one moment (v. 20), Jesus is saying the words of institution, and then the very next moment (v. 21-22) Jesus is predicting his betrayal!</p>
<p>In v. 23, the disciples are understandably confused. But then (v. 24) they immediately start bickering about who’s the greatest disciple!</p>
<p>So, Jesus has to remind them (vv. 25-30) that, in his kingdom, true greatness and authority come only through sacrificial service.</p>
<p>What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>I think that these final scenes in our passage offer us a challenging reminder of how the Lord’s Lasting Supper should shape us.</p>
<p>They show us, albeit through the failure of Judas and the disciples, how the remembrance of Holy Communion should transform us into sacrificial servants of Jesus Christ and one another.</p>
<h2 id="servants-or-traitors">Servants? Or Traitors?</h2>
<p>Let me put it to you this way:</p>
<p><strong>When you come to the Lord’s Table, you either come as a servant or a traitor.</strong></p>
<p>You either live a life of serving as you are served by Jesus, or you live a life of grabbing glory and honor and power for yourself.</p>
<p>In our New Testament lesson from 1 Corinthians, the Apostle Paul said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
<p>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup” (1 Cor. 11:27-28).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, you can ask yourself many different questions during this process of self-examination, but here’s one for your consideration: do my “table manners” match Jesus’ table manners?</p>
<p>Here are some of the last words of exhortation Jesus gives to his disciples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors.</p>
<p>But not so with you.</p>
<p>Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.</p>
<p>For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves?</p>
<p>Is it not the one who reclines at table?</p>
<p>But I am among you as the one who serves” (Luke 22:25-27).</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve got good news, friends: <strong>Jesus is still among us today as the one who serves.</strong></p>
<p>Like always, he gives us his very self, for the sake of our salvation.</p>
<p>Will we follow his example? Will we gratefully accept his service, and – in joyful response to his salvation – serve others in Jesus’ name? Or will we come in betrayal, seeking honor for only ourselves?</p>
<h2 id="foot-washing">Foot Washing</h2>
<p>Now, during our service of Holy Communion, we are going to have a service of Foot-Washing. During that time, I’d like you to remember that the same Lord who washed his disciples’ feet – the dirtiest parts of their bodies – now washes away even the dirtiest parts of our lives with his blood.</p>
<p>And I’d like you to ask yourself: <strong>are you living a life of Christ-like service?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, maybe you don’t wash other people’s feet all the time, but are you willing to sacrificially serve others, as you yourself have been served by Jesus?</p>
<p>The answer, by the way, is NOT “try harder! Be better! Serve more!” No!</p>
<p>INSTEAD, it is to surrender your entire life to Jesus. Only when you’ve accepted his salvation and his lordship will you be able to serve others out of the overflow of Christ’s love in your life.</p>
<h2 id="the-lords-table">The Lord’s Table</h2>
<p>And of course, in addition to the foot-washing, we will come to the Lord’s Table. And, during that time, I’d like you to remember that the same Messiah who so frequently ate with outcasts and sinners now welcomes us outcasts and sinners to come to his table and receive the saving benefits of his broken body and his shed blood.</p>
<p>Friends, <strong>do our table manners match Jesus’ table manners?</strong> Are we reaching out to outcasts and sinners and welcoming them to our tables at home? Are we letting the hurting, the lost, and the broken around us know where they can find food and drink that lead to true, everlasting life?</p>
<p>Remember: <strong>the Lasting Supper is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you come to the Lord’s table, you either come as a traitor or a servant.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks be to God, who invites us all to the table of our Lord Jesus Christ, where he is the gracious host and we are the rebellious traitors who are transformed into faithful servants.</p>
<p><em>Amen</em>.</p>

<h2 id="opening-prayer">Opening Prayer</h2>
<p>God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote your <strong>justice</strong></li>
<li>embody your <strong>steadfast faithful love</strong></li>
<li>and <strong>humbly</strong> obey Your will,</li>
</ul>
<p>even if it costs us our <em>reputations</em>, and even if it costs us our <em>lives</em>.</p>
<p>I ask that this transformation would begin with <strong>me</strong>. In Jesus’ name. <em>Amen</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’d like to start off with a very basic question: <strong>Do you want to get ahead in life?</strong></p>
<p>Do you want things to get better? Do you want your life, and your children’s lives, to improve?</p>
<p>I mean, despite the many things that divide us humans, don’t we all want progress? When it comes right down to it, don’t we all just want to get ahead?</p>
<p><em><strong>I know I do.</strong></em></p>
<p>In fact, as the students in our youth group could tell you, this is one of the reasons why I love “life hacks”!</p>
<p>Have you heard of life hacks? They’re these little tips and tricks to get ahead in life while saving time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Like, one of my favorite life hacks is the “coffee nap.” You drink a cup of coffee, then immediately take a 20-minute nap, so that the caffeine kicks in right as you wake up.</p>
<p>Life hack. Try it sometime. Thank me later.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS, we all want to get ahead in life. Right?</p>
<p>But there’s a problem: How do we know what <em>getting ahead</em> looks like?</p>
<p>I mean, think about it. Getting ahead can look quite different in different contexts. Right?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is too crude of an example for a sermon, but getting ahead in a drinking game looks totally different than getting ahead in Alcoholics Anonymous!</p>
<p>Getting ahead in the NBA Finals hopefully looks different than getting ahead in playing basketball with your kids.</p>
<p>Getting ahead on Wall Street as a day-trader hopefully looks different than getting ahead in running a charity.</p>
<p>In order to get ahead,</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to know the <strong>context</strong>,</li>
<li>you have to know the <strong>rules</strong>,</li>
<li>you have to know the <strong>goal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, no matter how hard you try, you’re not really going to get ahead. You’ll just be getting ahead at the wrong thing. Which means you’ll fail.</p>
<p>So here’s the kicker: <strong>Getting ahead in God’s eyes looks a whole lot different than getting ahead in the world’s eyes.</strong></p>
<p>The world is a different context. The world follows different rules. And the world has a different goal than God’s Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-point">The Main Point</h2>
<p>In fact, and here’s my main point if you want to write it down:</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foolish</span> in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<h2 id="gods-upside-down-kingdom--1-corinthians-118-31">God’s Upside-Down Kingdom – 1 Corinthians 1:18-31</h2>
<p>Now, this is the message of all of our readings for today, but I’d like to start with the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:18. (You can find it on page 952 in your pew Bible.)</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 1:18 says:</p>
<p><em><strong>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing</strong></em> (that’s what I’m calling “the world,” by the way – those who are perishing), <em><strong>but to us who are being saved</strong></em> (that is, to us who are a part of God’s Kingdom) <em><strong>it is the power of God.</strong></em></p>
<p>You see, <strong><u>God’s not against getting ahead</u></strong>. In fact, you could even say that God is on a mission to “Make Creation Great Again”!</p>
<p>I’m not kidding! He made it great in the first place – a perfect universe with perfect relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation.</p>
<p>However, ever since we humans rebelled against God – ever since Sin shattered the relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation – God has been on a mission to put everything back together again.</p>
<p>Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>So why is Paul saying that the good news of God’s rescue mission is <em><strong>foolishness</strong></em> to the world?</p>
<p>Because God makes creation great again in a totally unexpected way!</p>
<p><strong>This is what I mean by “<u>God’s upside-down kingdom</u>.”</strong></p>
<p>In order to make the world right again, God shows up and <strong>reverses</strong> the ways the world has gotten used to working. And the greatest reversal of all in God’s upside-down kingdom is when <strong>the eternal Son of God becomes <u>human</u> and gets himself <u>killed</u> for the sins of the entire world.</strong></p>
<p>The world expects</p>
<ul>
<li>power,</li>
<li>might,</li>
<li>strength,</li>
<li>and victory,</li>
</ul>
<p>and we receive instead a</p>
<ul>
<li>naked,</li>
<li>abandoned</li>
<li>Middle-Eastern man,</li>
<li>brutally executed</li>
<li>as a political criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>We receive a <em><strong>bloody example</strong></em> for those who would dare challenge the kingdoms of this world.</p>
<p>We receive a <em><strong>Crucified</strong></em> <em><strong>Savior</strong></em>. And the world calls that absolutely <em><strong><u>RIDICULOUS</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>Because, to the world, you don’t get ahead by <strong>laying your life down</strong> (like Jesus did). You get ahead by <em><u>taking what’s yours</u></em>.</p>
<p>You don’t get ahead by <strong>hanging out with the wrong crowd</strong> (like Jesus did). You’re supposed to <em><u>rub shoulders with the rich and the famous</u></em>, not the <strong>poor</strong> and the <strong>homeless</strong>.</p>
<p>You’re not supposed to <strong>focus on the people at the bottom and at the border</strong> (like Jesus did)!</p>
<p>For crying out loud, you’re supposed to get out there and <em><u>hustle</u></em>!</p>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Climb the ladder! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Make deals! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Take no prisoners! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Make demands! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Get ahead!</u></em></li>
</ul>
<p>…And get right back where we need to be saved <em><strong><u>FROM</u></strong></em>!</p>
<p><em><strong>That’s where the world’s ways get us.</strong></em></p>
<p>Where every human is</p>
<ul>
<li>an egotistical island,</li>
<li>competing with God,</li>
<li>alienating other humans,</li>
<li>and abusing creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, as Paul tells us in <strong>[<u>1 Cor 1:25</u>]</strong>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God saves us through what looks like foolishness and weakness.</p>
<p>Why? So that we would not boast in our pathetic “wisdom” and “strength.”</p>
<p>Instead, we are to boast only in the true wisdom and strength of God.</p>
<p>Paul continues in <strong>[<u>1 Cor. 1:27</u>]</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But God chose what is <u>foolish</u> in the world to shame the <u>wise</u>; God chose what is <u>weak</u> in the world to shame the <u>strong</u>; <sup>28 </sup>God chose what is <u>low</u> and <u>despised</u> in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, <sup>29 </sup>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This, then, is the <strong>upside-down Kingdom of God</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="blessed-are-the-losers--matthew-51-12">Blessed are the “Losers” – Matthew 5:1-12</h2>
<p>And it’s the exact same Kingdom that we find in the Beatitudes of Matthew 5.</p>
<p>(FYI: We call them the “Beatitudes” because of the Latin word for “blessed/happy” – <em>beatus</em>.)</p>
<p>Now, remember: <strong>God isn’t against getting ahead. He really does want what’s <u>best</u> for us.</strong></p>
<p>But the danger is that we’ll try to get ahead on our own, in our own way. And if we do that, <strong><u>we’ll miss the point in at least two ways. </u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First, we won’t realize that <strong>we desperately need a Savior</strong>, and that <strong>we cannot save ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>Second, we will <strong>ignore</strong> the very <strong>people</strong> that God wants us to <strong>care for</strong> in order to really get ahead in his Kingdom!</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on our own</span>, we’re going to focus on those at the <strong>center</strong> and <strong>height</strong> of <strong>power</strong>. You know, “The Winners.”</p>
<p>But <u>God focuses</u> on those at the <strong>bottom</strong> and at the <strong>borders</strong>, the <strong>edges</strong> of society. You know, “The Losers.”</p>
<p><em>These</em> are the people who will experience God’s favor in his Upside-Down Kingdom. Take a look at [<strong><u>Matthew 5:3-12</u></strong>].</p>
<p>Notice how Jesus declares God’s favor, His blessing, to what the world would call the “wrong kind of people.”</p>
<ul>
<li>To the <strong>poor</strong> in spirit</li>
<li>Those who <strong>mourn</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>meek</strong></li>
<li>Those who <strong>hunger</strong> and thirst for righteousness</li>
<li>The <strong>merciful</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>pure</strong> in heart</li>
<li>The <strong>peacemakers</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>persecuted</strong></li>
<li>And the <strong>reviled</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And notice as well, that the blessings frequently involve <strong>reversals</strong>. The world is giving them one thing, but God is going to give them another.</p>
<p>Now, this is important: these famous words are a <strong><u>mixture</u></strong> of <strong>encouragement</strong> and <strong>instruction</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, Jesus isn’t just giving us a TO-DO LIST in order to get as much blessing as possible. He’s not saying “Go out there and try harder to be poor, persecuted, hungry, mourners.”</p>
<p>Now, Jesus IS <strong>instructing</strong>, more on that in a second. <strong>But</strong> he is first offering divine <strong>encouragement</strong> to those who are <em><strong><u>already</u></strong></em> in those situations.</p>
<h2 id="the-beatitudes-an-interpretive-translation">The Beatitudes: An Interpretive Translation</h2>
<p>Here’s my interpretive translation of the Beatitudes. Follow along with each one if you’ve got a Bible in front of you.</p>
<p>Jesus is saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) “Take heart! Things aren’t what they seem! If you <strong>lack resources</strong> and realize that God alone can save you, then you might not feel like a part of the Roman kingdom. But <strong>you’re a part of God’s Kingdom</strong>.”</li>
<li>(2) “Be encouraged! If you <strong>bear</strong> and <strong>grieve</strong> the <strong>sufferings</strong> of the world, then the kings of the world probably won’t give you much <strong>comfort</strong>. <strong>But God, your true King, will.</strong></li>
<li>(3) Take heart! If you <strong>humbly</strong> and <strong>gently</strong> <strong>refuse</strong> to seek <strong>vengeance</strong> or <strong>power</strong>, then you probably won’t inherit much from the world’s kingdoms. <strong>But God will give you an inheritance in His Kingdom</strong>.</li>
<li>(4) Be encouraged! If you <strong>pursue God’s will above all else</strong>, then you’ll probably go <strong>hungry</strong> in this world. But you will be <strong>satisfied</strong> in God’s Kingdom, where His <strong>will</strong> is <strong>obeyed</strong>.</li>
<li>(5) Take heart! If you show <strong>mercy</strong> and <strong>compassion</strong> to a suffering world, you might not receive much mercy back! <strong>But you yourselves will be shown mercy by God.</strong></li>
<li>(6) Be encouraged! If you <strong>single-mindedly</strong> pursue God’s will, then you probably won’t experience the world’s glory. <strong>But</strong> <strong>you will experience God’s glory and presence.</strong></li>
<li>(7) Take heart! If you <strong>pursue</strong> <strong>reconciliation</strong> and <strong>reject violence</strong>, then you probably won’t reflect the character of this world. <strong>But you will reflect the character of God.</strong></li>
<li>(8) Take heart! Because when this world <strong>rejects</strong> you, <strong>insults</strong> you, <strong>lies</strong> about you, and <strong>persecutes</strong> you, then it may not look like it, <strong>but you’re in good company! You’re in the company of your Savior, Jesus Christ.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Friends, if you’re here today and you’re at the bottom of this world, then I <strong>encourage</strong> you to <strong>cling</strong> to the divine <strong>promises</strong> of <strong>blessing</strong> in the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>God is in the process of making all things new – <strong>reversing</strong> every wrong in this world. <em><strong><u>Take heart.</u></strong></em></p>
<p>However, and perhaps this is uncomfortable to talk about, <strong>what if we’re NOT on this list?</strong></p>
<p>What if we’re NOT</p>
<ul>
<li>poor,</li>
<li>mourning,</li>
<li>meek,</li>
<li>hungry,</li>
<li>merciful,</li>
<li>pure-hearted,</li>
<li>peacemakers</li>
<li>who are persecuted?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if we’re</p>
<ul>
<li>reasonably well-educated</li>
<li>and wealthy,</li>
<li>comfortable,</li>
<li>powerful</li>
<li>American</li>
<li>Christians?</li>
</ul>
<p>How should we respond to the Beatitudes?</p>
<p>While I <strong>DON’T</strong> think that the Beatitudes should be read like a <strong>TO-DO list</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>I DO think that the Beatitudes are an <u>instructive</u> <u>challenge</u> to followers of Jesus.</strong></p>
<p>There is a reason why the Beatitudes are at the beginning of Jesus’ quintessential sermon.</p>
<p>It’s almost like Jesus is saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“OK, you want to follow me?</p>
<p>You want to be a part of my coming Kingdom? Then let’s get really clear on <strong>what this Kingdom is going to be like</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be the kind of Kingdom you’re used to in this world.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of kingdom where the <strong>wealthy</strong>, <strong>wise</strong>, and <strong>powerful</strong> get <u>rewarded</u>.</p>
<p>Instead, in MY Kingdom, <strong>the people who get <u>chewed up</u> and <u>spit out</u> by the kingdoms of this world will be <u>rewarded</u> and <u>honored</u>.</strong></p>
<p>SO,</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want to be a part of my Kingdom,</li>
<li>if you want to “get ahead” in my Kingdom,</li>
<li>then <strong>you better show concrete concern for</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>the oppressed,</strong></li>
<li><strong>the marginalized,</strong></li>
<li><strong>and the weak!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as you do so, you’d better be prepared to end up among the oppressed and the marginalized, because the world is going to think you are out of your minds!”</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="fear-is-not-a-valid-excuse">Fear is NOT a Valid Excuse</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, remember:</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But there is no escape clause from the rules of God’s Kingdom!</strong></p>
<p>That is, you can’t just ignore Jesus and the Bible because you’re SCARED.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>how a congregation is going to respond to your sermon,</strong></li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>looking foolish</strong>,</li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>losing your job</strong>,</li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>a terrorist attack</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not that Jesus doesn’t care about your fears. He does.</p>
<p><em><strong>But let’s not kid ourselves!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>FEAR</strong> is not a valid excuse for ignoring the Bible’s repeated commands for God’s people to show faithful concern for the kinds of people the world ignores and mistreats!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="application-consistently-pro-life-for-the-unborn-and-the-refugees">Application: Consistently Pro-Life, for the Unborn AND the Refugees</h2>
<p>So, let’s get practical here. How should we respond to these passages about God’s Upside-Down Kingdom?</p>
<p>We must show concrete concern for the powerless. And two recent issues come to mind, that I would be a coward not to mention.</p>
<h3 id="abortion">Abortion</h3>
<p><strong><u>First</u></strong>, in light of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Life_(Washington,_D.C.)">44th March for Life</a> held this past weekend, <strong>I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that we must continue to stand up for the unborn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abortion</strong> is a gruesome <strong>evil</strong>. And like other forms of evil, it is complex – not easily eradicated.</p>
<p>As Christians, we must wage war against this evil. And that will involve caring not only for the <strong>unborn child</strong>, but also the <strong>mother</strong>, and the child <strong>after</strong> it is born, and the entire <strong>family</strong>.</p>
<p>Repealing Roe v. Wade isn’t going to completely solve the problem.</p>
<p>Christians will have to step up to the plate and be <strong>consistently pro-life</strong> in order to fix things.</p>
<p>If you’re passionate about this issue, I encourage you to check out the organization <a href="http://anglicansforlife.org/"><strong>Anglicans for Life</strong></a> at <strong><a href="http://anglicansforlife.org/">AnglicansForLife.Org</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>So, first, we must stand up for the unborn.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="refugees">Refugees</h3>
<p><strong><u>Second</u></strong>, given <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/01/trump-immigration-order-muslims/514844/">President Trump’s recent executive actions</a> to halt the acceptance of all refugees to the USA, including a temporary moratorium on seven predominantly Muslim countries,</p>
<p><strong>I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that, if we are to be consistently pro-life, we must also stand up for the <u>refugees</u>.</strong></p>
<p>Next to the unborn, refugees around the world – but especially from Syria – are among the most <strong>vulnerable</strong> and <strong>powerless</strong> people in the world.</p>
<p>Christians should be standing up for and supporting these people. And, to their credit, many Christians are doing so.</p>
<p>I’d encourage you to check out the great work being done by organizations like <a href="https://www.worldrelief.org/"><strong>World Relief</strong></a> and <a href="https://wewelcomerefugees.com/"><strong>We Welcome Refugees</strong></a>. Talk to me after the service if you’d like more ideas and reading recommendations, by the way.</p>
<p>However, many Christians in this country are <strong>falling prey to the fear excuse</strong>.</p>
<p>We’re being tempted to turn away these vulnerable people because of the <strong>supposed risk of a terrorist attack</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong>I’m here this morning to plead with you: Do not fall prey to this nonsense.</strong> </u></strong></p>
<p>Even if the fear were <em><strong>legitimate</strong></em>, it is no <strong>excuse</strong> for Christians not to show concrete love to the powerless.</p>
<p>Whoever said that following Jesus would not involve any risks?</p>
<p>We dare not worship the <em><strong>American gods</strong></em> of <strong>comfort</strong> and <strong>security</strong> while neglecting to follow the True God’s commands.</p>
<p>However, <strong>these fears of refugees are VASTLY overblown.</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf">a September 2016 <strong>Policy Analysis</strong> from the <strong>CATO</strong> institute</a>,</p>
<ul>
<li>“the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a <strong>refugee</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>1 in 3.64 billion per year.”</strong></li>
<li>The chance of being murdered in a terrorist attack committed by an <strong>asylum-seeker is 1 in 2.73 billion per year.</strong></li>
<li>And “the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an <strong>illegal</strong> <strong>immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison: <a href="http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx">according to the National Safety Council</a>, <strong>your chance of dying from a lightning strike is 1 in 174,426</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong><u><strong>That means it’s about 20,868 times more likely that you will get killed by lightning than by a refugee terrorist attack.</strong></u></strong></em></p>
<p>While we’re worried about astronomical odds, these people are dying. The death toll from the Syrian conflict is approaching half a million, including 50 thousand children.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, please don’t mishear me. I’m not saying that the USA shouldn’t change anything about its policies. Surely there are many problems which need fixed.</p>
<p>However, I beg you: please do not fall prey to the fear-mongering. Please think and reason as <strong>Christians</strong> first.</p>
<p>After all, you can only give your “total allegiance” to one thing.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ will not settle for second place to the United States.</strong></p>
<p>So, stand up for the unborn and the refugees, not to mention the countless other marginalized, oppressed, and powerless people around us.</p>
<p>And I don’t even have time to get into how Christians should be concerned for religious liberties for all faiths. That’s a whole other sermon…</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But, if our Gospel is true, then we of all people should be willing to put our lives and our reputations at risk for the sake of others – especially for the poor and the needy.</strong></p>
<h2 id="closing-prayer">Closing Prayer</h2>
<p>So, again, God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would transform us from the inside out</p>
<ul>
<li>So that we would promote your <strong>justice</strong></li>
<li>So that we would embody your <strong>steadfast faithful love</strong></li>
<li>and so that we would <strong>humbly</strong> obey Your will,</li>
<li>even if it costs us our <em>reputations</em>,</li>
<li>and even if it costs us our <em>lives</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ask that this transformation would begin with me, and that it would extend to the ends of the earth. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

      <title>A Disappointing Christmas Homily</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! And Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, let us pray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good morning! And Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>Together, let us pray:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. <strong><em>Amen</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Almighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. <em><strong>Amen.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>You know, they say that Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. I’ve even heard it said that it’s the “hap-happiest season of all”!</p>
<p>But, can I take a poll real quick?</p>
<p>Please raise your hand if you’ve ever had a disappointing Christmas.</p>
<p>I mean a Christmas that didn’t live up to your expectations. You wanted it to be filled with love, happiness, and peace, and instead all you got was stress, anxiety, and loneliness.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-ever-had-a-disappointing-christmas">Have you ever had a disappointing Christmas?</h3>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>Now, why am I being such a downer? Isn’t this supposed to be a joyful occasion?</p>
<p>I mean, joy, triumph, and exultation practically drip out of every song we’ve sung and every passage we’ve read this morning! Why talk about the disappointments of Christmas?</p>
<p>Well, because we too often try to combat the disappointments of Christmas with shallow denial or escapism.</p>
<p>When things go wrong at Christmas,</p>
<ul>
<li>we tell the kids to shut up and turn the Christmas music up a little louder.</li>
<li>We throw money at our problems.</li>
<li>We withdraw into our shells,</li>
<li>and delude ourselves into thinking that next year will be different.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe, we’ve encountered so many disappointments, heartbreaks, and disasters in this world that we’ve given up hope completely.</p>
<p>We come to Church – perhaps just once a year, around Christmas – for the sake of relatives or nostalgia. But the story of Christ’s birth rings just as hollow as any other Christmas story.</p>
<p>I mean, can we really sing “Joy to the World” in Aleppo, Syria?</p>
<p>In South Sudan?</p>
<p>In Berlin?</p>
<p>In the intensive care unit?</p>
<p>In our own troubled homes?</p>
<p><strong>Yes, we can. In fact, we <em>must</em>.</strong></p>
<h3 id="we-must-sing-joy-to-the-world--even-through-tears--in-the-deepest-and-darkest-disappointments-of-this-world">We must sing Joy to the World – even through tears – in the deepest and darkest disappointments of this world.</h3>
<p>No matter how painful things get, we cannot celebrate Christmas by ignoring, denying, and detaching from the world around us.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because, although we live in a deeply disappointing world, we do not worship a disappointing God.</p>
<p>Although we frequently feel distant and detached from God and from one another, he is not distant or detached from us!</p>
<p>Instead, he has dwelt among us – as one of us! – in order to bring us back into perfect relationship with Him, with each other, and with all of creation.</p>
<p>Although we rebel against God, and run in the opposite direction – away from light and life into darkness and death – he does not abandon us. He does not keep us at arm’s length.</p>
<p>No, instead He dives from heaven’s heights into the muck and the mire of our sin- and death-stained world. He joins us in the thick of things, in order to bring us back to God.</p>
<h3 id="consider-the-disappointing-circumstances-of-his-birth">Consider the disappointing circumstances of his birth!</h3>
<p>We have thoroughly romanticized the nativity scene. Sure, there were glimpses of the extraordinary – such as the appearance of angels and the fact that Jesus was born to a virgin.</p>
<p>But when you consider that this is the arrival of the eternal and divine Son of God to the world he created, Christ’s birth is remarkably ordinary and humble – you may even call it disappointing, if you didn’t know any better.</p>
<p>It happened in a feeding trough, surrounded by animals and poor shepherds. He was born to poor parents, not yet fully wed! And this all took place in a tiny, po-dunk sheep town!</p>
<p><strong><em>This</em>?! <em>This</em> is Christ the King? Whom shepherds guard and angels sing?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This</em> is the eternal Son of God?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this baby in a feeding trough?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> is the heir of all things? The creator of heaven and earth?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this homeless itinerant preacher with a penchant for lepers, prostitutes, and tax-collectors?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact of imprint of his nature?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this criminal hanging on a bloodstained Roman cross?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> upholds the universe by the word of his power?</strong></p>
<h3 id="are-you-sure">Are you sure?!</h3>
<p>Because at his birth, throughout his life, and at his death, he is surrounded by the <strong>outcasts</strong> of this world! By the broken bits that the universe churns out!</p>
<p><strong>Are you sure this is God? Are you sure this is how he saves the world?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Yes</strong></em>. Although, I do understand that this is <em>shocking</em>.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-is-shocking">Christmas is shocking.</h3>
<p>It’s either a shocking disappointment or a shocking hope.</p>
<p>As we read in Hebrews, <em><strong>in these last days, God has spoken to us through his Son, Jesus Christ.</strong></em></p>
<p>But what he has spoken can, at least for now, be <em>rejected</em> and ignored.</p>
<p>Consider again the words of John 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="why-would-we-reject-jesus">Why would we reject Jesus?</h3>
<p>Perhaps we’re not interested in such humble Savior. We’re interested in power, and we’re interested in staying in control.</p>
<p>We think that, despite life’s disappointments, we can fix this on our own. We can give our own lives some sense of meaning and purpose. We think we can save ourselves…</p>
<p>But <strong>we can’t save ourselves from Sin and Death</strong>. And it’s about time we admit that.</p>
<h3 id="thankfully-however-that-baby-born-in-bethlehem-can-save-us-all">Thankfully, however, that baby born in Bethlehem can save us all</h3>
<p>– even those at the <strong>bottom</strong> of this world – because he himself went to the bottom, to the outcasts, to the borders, and to the grave.</p>
<p>But he didn’t stay there!</p>
<p>He rose again victorious over the grave.</p>
<p>His death put Death itself to death.</p>
<p>And, as Hebrews 1 says, <strong>“After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.”</strong></p>
<p>And from there we await his <strong>return</strong>.</p>
<p>The Word who became flesh and made his dwelling among us will dwell with us once more, as Revelation 21 tells us.</p>
<p>He will wipe away every tear from our eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-be-a-part-of-this-hope">How can we be a part of this hope?</h3>
<p>Not by rejecting Jesus, but by receiving him. As John 1 continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have not yet <strong>received</strong> Jesus, entrusting your life to him as your Lord and Savior, then I beg you to <strong>do so</strong> this morning.</p>
<p>As we’ll sing in a bit, this is the meaning of Christmas! Christ was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>born that we no more may die, born to raise us from the earth, born to give us second birth!</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now! He stands ready and willing to save you, to forgive you, and to welcome you into eternal life – if you will turn to him in <strong>repentance</strong> and <strong>faith</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s the response some of you are called to make this Christmas.</p>
<p>What about the rest of us?</p>
<h3 id="we-are-all-of-us-called-to-worship-the-god-who-has-dwelt-among-us-in-order-to-save-us">We are, all of us, called to worship the God who has dwelt among us in order to save us.</h3>
<p>We are, all of us, called to sing to the Lord a fresh, new song, for he has done marvelous things!</p>
<p>In the midst of the sorrows and disappointments of this world, with which our God is well-acquainted, we are, all of us, called to make a joyful noise to the Lord, to break forth into joyous songs and sing praises!</p>
<p>Amen?</p>

      <title>Following Jesus Beyond the Bandwagon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A chapel message in a Christian school.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you should know about me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a student at a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; seminary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I went to a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; college.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I went to a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; high school, and a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; middle school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also: I’m &lt;strong&gt;the world’s worst sports fan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every week, they’re like, “Josh, did you see the game?!” “Josh, are you going to watch the game?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(A chapel message in a Christian school.)</em></p>
<p>There are a few things you should know about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a student at a <em>Christian</em> seminary.</li>
<li>Before that, I went to a <em>Christian</em> college.</li>
<li>Before that, I went to a <em>Christian</em> high school, and a <em>Christian</em> middle school.</li>
<li>Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a <em>Christian</em> home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, also: I’m <strong>the world’s worst sports fan</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every week, they’re like, “Josh, did you see the game?!” “Josh, are you going to watch the game?”</p>
<p>And I’m like, “Game? What game? I don’t even know which sport’s season it is!”</p>
<p>World’s. worst. sports fan. I’m telling you.</p>
<p>The one redeeming quality about my sports fandom is that I’ve stuck with one team through thick and thin: the University of Michigan Wolverines. Go Blue!</p>
<p>Now, I know that the rivalry between the Wolverines and the Ohio State Buckeyes is but a pale imitation of the rivalry between Alabama and Auburn down here. But up North, this rivalry was and is a big deal.</p>
<p>And it was really interesting, back when I was in middle school and high school, to observe what would happen each year in November when the Wolverines and the Buckeyes went at it.</p>
<p>I’m from Toledo, OH, which is on the border with Michigan, so the fan split was about 50/50 – Wolverines on one side, Buckeyes on the other.</p>
<p>And each year, on the day after the big game, you could tell who the true fans were…</p>
<p>It was the people still cheering for the team that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>lost</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>Why not the winning fans? Weren’t they just as legit?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. Perhaps they were legitimate, lifelong fans. But, on the other hand, they could just be cheering for the winning team because they won, right?</p>
<p>They could, in other words, just be <strong>bandwagon</strong> fans.</p>
<h2 id="bandwagon-fans-are-the-worst-right">Bandwagon fans are the worst. <em>Right</em>?</h2>
<p>I mean, you can’t trust them. Sure, they look like a die-hard fan now, when the team is doing well. But, when things get rough, when those wins stop coming, they disappear! On to the next team, at least as long as they keep on winning…</p>
<p>Bandwagon fans. <em>Those people</em> are the worst.</p>
<p>But, you know, if we’re honest with ourselves, <em><strong>we</strong></em> tend to ride a lot of bandwagons in life, and not just in sports.</p>
<p>We ride the bandwagon when it comes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>How we speak</li>
<li>What we wear</li>
<li>What we read</li>
<li>What we listen to</li>
<li>What we watch</li>
<li>What we eat and drink</li>
</ul>
<p>We ride bandwagons when it comes to our friends. Our hobbies.</p>
<p>And, if we’re really honest with ourselves, our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faith</span>.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-bandwagon-christians">We are Bandwagon Christians</h2>
<p>Hear me out. Hear me out. I’m not saying that there are no genuine followers of Jesus Christ here.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that, to some extent, being a Christian is built into the very fabric of our lives. I am, after all, speaking here at a Christian school, which meets in a church!</p>
<p>And me? I’m no better. I’m a student at a Christian school, and always have been! I’ve been around Christians my entire life!</p>
<p>Now, is being around Christians a bad thing? Should we all stop going to church?</p>
<p>No! That’s not what I’m saying.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that, if we’re not careful, following Jesus Christ will be just another thing we do to go with the flow, to follow the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Following Jesus will become just a matter of convenience, instead of devotion.</strong></p>
<p>And, just like any bandwagon fan, the danger for us bandwagon Christians is that, when things get tough, we’ll be exposed for who we really are – followers of ourselves, instead of followers of Jesus.</p>
<p>Friends, we’re all, to some extent, bandwagon Christians.</p>
<p>And here’s the bad news:</p>
<h2 id="jesus-doesnt-want-bandwagon-followers">Jesus Doesn’t Want Bandwagon Follower<strong>s!</strong></h2>
<p>Turn with me, if you’ve got your Bible, to Luke, chapter 14. Verse 25.</p>
<p>Now, for a bit of context, Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem. You know, where he’s about to be tortured and killed. And he’s got this big ol’ crowd of people with him.</p>
<p>I want you to imagine that we – all of us – are in that group of people, following Jesus.</p>
<p>And Jesus is about to drop a truth-bomb on all of us, that he is not interested in bandwagon followers. He doesn’t want them.</p>
<p>What does he want? Let’s read to find out. Verse 25 begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>25 </sup>Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them,<sup>26 </sup>“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="jesus-doesnt-want-bandwagon-followers-instead-he-wants-your-ultimate-loyalty">Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers. Instead, he wants your ultimate loyalty.</h3>
<p>See, he’s not urging us to get really angry at our family. And he’s not telling you to hate yourself or beat yourself up.</p>
<p>No, instead the word “hate” here emphasizes a <em>decision</em> to be made: <strong>who are you going to be loyal to, above all else?</strong></p>
<p>In that culture, your family was your source of identity. You were supposed to be loyal to them, no matter what.</p>
<p>Is Jesus saying that families are bad? No. Not at all.</p>
<p>But he is saying that, for his followers, he needs to be even more important to them than whatever else they give their loyalty to.</p>
<p>So, what is that for you and I, today? Is it your family? Or is it your friends? Is it your popularity, or the way you look? Is it your athletic or musical ability?</p>
<p><strong>Where do you find your identity? What gets your ultimate loyalty?</strong></p>
<p>Is it Jesus? Or is it ______?</p>
<p>Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers; he wants your <strong>ultimate loyalty</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="he-also-wants-your-life">He also wants your life.</h3>
<p>Let’s read verse 27:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>27 </sup>Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus is saying that his followers are to live as if they’re condemned to die. Pick up your electric chair and follow Jesus!</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds gruesome. But think about it. If you were really condemned to be executed soon, how would you live differently?</p>
<p>You see, death has a weird way of revealing what’s really important to us. If you knew you were going to die soon, would you spend your time chasing after status, money, or fame?</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>Jesus wants us to live differently than the world around us. He wants us to live in a way that screams to the world “There is more to life than being powerful! There is more to life than being popular! There is more to life than being pretty!”</p>
<p>And, if we live that way, we might suffer for it. We might lose friends, money, and influence. We might even get ourselves killed.</p>
<p>But Jesus wants our <strong>loyalty</strong>, and he wants our <strong>lives</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="ok-how-do-we-get-there">OK, how do we get there?</h2>
<h3 id="the-first-step-is-to-count-the-cost">The first step is to count the cost.</h3>
<p>Let’s read verses 28-32:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>28 </sup>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? <sup>29 </sup>Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, <sup>30 </sup>saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’</p>
<p><sup>31 </sup>Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? <sup>32 </sup>And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Jesus wants our loyalty and our lives, then it’s a good idea to stop and consider what we’re getting ourselves into before we claim to be his followers!</p>
<p>We need to count the cost, just like the tower-builder or the king going to war.</p>
<p>But, did you catch something else? We’re not just supposed to count the cost for no good reason. No! It’s supposed to teach us something.</p>
<h3 id="were-supposed-to-count-the-cost-and-to-realize-that-we-dont-have-what-it-takes">We’re supposed to count the cost, and to realize that we <em>don’t</em> have what it takes!</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Jesus says, we’re going to get embarrassed if we try and rush into things on our own. We don’t have what it takes.</p>
<p>What a motivational chapel message this is turning out to be! Hate your family and hate yourself, because you don’t have what it takes! Amen?!</p>
<p>Let’s read one more verse, verse 33:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>33 </sup>So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.</p></blockquote>
<p>Friends, it might not feel like it, but we’ve actually arrived at the good news. Remember, the bad news is that we’re all riding the bandwagon, and that Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-news-is-that-jesus-died-for-bandwagon-followers-like-you-and-me">The good news is that Jesus died for bandwagon followers, like you and me.</h2>
<p>Jesus rose again from the dead for bandwagon followers, like you and me.</p>
<p>And Jesus offers a new life to bandwagon followers, like you and me.</p>
<p>When our loyalty runs out, he remains faithful to us. When we fail, over and over again, to give our own lives meaning, he gives us the love, the purpose, and the meaning in life that we’re searching for.</p>
<p>When we come up short, Jesus carries us through.</p>
<p>Because no, we don’t have what it takes. But he does.</p>
<p>And he delights to give us what it takes to follow him into new, eternal life.</p>
<p>So, even though it’s incredibly hard to get off the bandwagon and pick up our cross, even though it’s really hard to give Jesus complete control over our lives, and to give him ultimate loyalty, above everything and everyone else, <strong>even though it’s the hardest, most difficult thing we will ever do,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Following Jesus is also the easiest, most joyful thing we will ever do.</strong></p>
<p>It’s easier than living life on the bandwagon. Why?</p>
<p>Because you don’t have to <strong>lie</strong> anymore, pretending you’re a follower of Jesus when really you’re the one calling the shots.</p>
<p>You don’t have to exhaust yourself trying to give your own life meaning. It doesn’t all depend on you and your effort and your strength and your skills…</p>
<p>NO, it depends on your Heavenly Father, who created you.</p>
<p>It depends on Jesus Christ, who died and rose again for you.</p>
<p>It depends on the Holy Spirit, who strengthens and empowers you to live life God’s way.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-does-jumping-off-the-bandwagon-to-follow-jesus-really-look-like">So, what does jumping off the bandwagon to follow Jesus really look like?</h2>
<p>Does it have to be this super-emotional, tear-filled conversion experience?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But I think that, for most of us, it’s going to look a lot more <strong>boring</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s why: we’re never going to <strong>become</strong> the people who pick up their crosses and renounce all they have, if we’re not becoming that kind of a person <strong>today</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, we need to pick up the little crosses each day. We need to say the small goodbyes to all we have each day.</p>
<p>What’s this look like? I think it looks like <strong>taking more risks for Jesus</strong>.</p>
<p>You know, it’s crazy. I think I’m more afraid of standing up to peer pressure than standing up to martyrdom!</p>
<p>It’s like, sure, I’ll take a bullet for you, Jesus. But please don’t make me call out my friend for that inappropriate joke,</p>
<p>Sure, I’ll go on that missions trip. But please don’t make me skip the game to go to church.</p>
<p>Sure, I’ll risk my life to spread the gospel. But please don’t make me risk my reputation by reaching out to that weirdo.</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our popularity?</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our athletic accomplishments?</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our everyday comfort?</p>
<h3 id="what-risk-is-jesus-asking-you-to-take-for-him-right-now-today">What risk is Jesus asking you to take for him right now, today?<u> </u></h3>
<p>Maybe it’s a conversation you need to have.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s an addiction or habit you need to break.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a fear you need to let go of.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s admitting that, although you really are a Christian, you’ve been riding the bandwagon, and you need to get off.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s admitting that, although you look like a Christian, you’ve only been riding the bandwagon, and you really aren’t following Jesus at all.</p>
<p>That’s a very difficult thing to admit.</p>
<p>But I promise you, you’re better off admitting it <strong>now</strong> than hiding it for years.</p>
<p>Jesus knows who you really are. Jesus knows who <strong>we</strong> really are, all of us.</p>
<p>He doesn’t want bandwagon followers. He doesn’t want people who think they have what it takes to give their lives meaning.</p>
<p>But Jesus is waiting with open arms to catch us, if we’re willing to jump off the bandwagon and follow him.</p>
<p>Are we willing to take the leap? To take the risk?</p>

      <title>The Feast of St. James the Apostle: A Homily for Ministers</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-feast-of-st-james-the-apostle-a-homily-for-ministers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 22:18:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-feast-of-st-james-the-apostle-a-homily-for-ministers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Readings: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+34%3B+Jeremiah+16%3A14-21%3B+Mark+1%3A14-20&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34;&gt;Psalm 34; Jeremiah 16:14-21; Mark 1:14-20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many other feast days – scheduled, as they are, on the days of the namesakes’ deaths – the feast day of St. James the Apostle is &lt;strong&gt;a strong rebuke to our aspirations&lt;/strong&gt;. To our aspirations as human beings, and especially to our aspirations as ministers of Christ’s Church.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 id="james--john-fishermen-no-more">James &amp; John: Fishermen No More?</h2>
<p>You see, <strong>James started off as a mere fisherman</strong>. An admirable one, to be sure, because he and his brother John answered Jesus’ call in Mark 1. They left behind their father, their family, and – they grew to hope! – their family’s fishing profession.</p>
<p>James was off on a new adventure, hopeful and headstrong. So much so that, along with his brother John, he earned the nickname “<strong>Son of Thunder</strong>”! Coming from the Son of Man, that’s no small compliment!</p>
<p>But their headstrong passion proved to be a <strong>weakness</strong> as well. In Luke 9, after getting rejected in Samaria, the Sons of Thunder offer to call fire down from heaven to consume the Samaritan village! This earns them a stern rebuke from Jesus.</p>
<p>And, even more famously, they approached Jesus with the following request in Mark 10:37:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="princes-or-fishermen">Princes? Or Fishermen?</h2>
<p>Now, their request is, in effect: <strong>“O King Jesus, would you please make us <span style="text-decoration: underline;">princes</span>?”</strong></p>
<p>And, granted, this is <em>Apocryphal</em>, but I imagine Jesus putting his arms around them and saying the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Princes? Princes?! Boys, if I had wanted princes, I would have called princes! But, I don’t need <strong>princes</strong>!</p>
<p>No, no, no. What I need are new <strong>fishermen</strong>! And that’s why I’ve called <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></strong>!”</p></blockquote>
<p>You see, <strong>James had been hoping for a new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">position</span>. And instead he received his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">old profession</span> – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">transformed</span>!</strong></p>
<h3 id="james-was-no-longer-to-be-a-mere-fisherman-but-a-fisher-of-men">James was no longer to be a mere fisherman, but a fisher of men.</h3>
<p>And not even just a fisher of men like Jeremiah 16 spoke of – for there the fishermen and hunters are instruments of judgment and exile.</p>
<p>No! Instead, James was to go fishing <em>with</em>, go fishing <em>for</em> Jesus, <strong>to bring people back from exile</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="now-undoubtedly-this-is-a-step-up-from-fishing-for-literal-fish">Now, undoubtedly, this is a step up from fishing for literal fish.</h3>
<p><em><strong>Or is it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Not necessarily. At least, not in the world’s eyes.</p>
<h2 id="the-death-of-st-james-the-apostle">The Death of St. James the Apostle</h2>
<p>Here’s Jesus’ actual answer to the “prince” request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”</p>
<p>And they said to him, “We are able.”</p>
<p>And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, granted, this isn’t one of the assigned lectionary passages for today, but I’d like us to look at the beginning of Acts 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He killed James the brother of John with the sword</span>, and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Swept aside, in just one verse!</strong> I doubt that sort of an abrupt, violent end awaited most of the fishermen working for Zebedee’s family business.</p>
<h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h2>
<p>Was it worth it? Did James receive any sort of a promotion, after all?</p>
<p>Of course, we know the <strong>right</strong> answer. But <strong>do we live it out?</strong></p>
<p>Are we thankful, are we satisfied with our roles as servants within Christ’s Church?</p>
<p>Are we willing to be “just” fishermen, even if it costs us our ambitions? Even if it costs us our lives?</p>
<p><img alt="Guido_Reni_-<em>Saint_James_the_Greater</em>-_Google_Art_Project" loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Guido_Reni_-_Saint_James_the_Greater_-_Google_Art_Project-218x300.jpg">By God’s grace, <strong>I hope so</strong>.</p>
<p>By God’s grace, may we – with the Apostle James – be able to confess the final words of Psalm 34 with open eyes, and open hearts. Perhaps it will help to imagine the following words on the dying Apostle’s lips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<br>
but the Lord delivers him out of them all.<br>
He keeps all his bones;<br>
not one of them is broken.<br>
Affliction will slay the wicked,<br>
and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.<br>
The Lord redeems the life of his servants;<br>
none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>

<p>What makes a great wedding?</p>
<p>Is it the fragrance and color of the flower arrangements? The particular grandeur of the venue?</p>
<p>Is it the number and camaraderie of the guests? Or the quality and sound of the music?</p>
<p>Is it the menu at the reception? Or perhaps the selection at the (hopefully open) bar?</p>
<p>I hope it’s not the quality of the sermon!</p>
<p>But, really, <strong>what makes a wedding great?</strong></p>
<p>Surely (gestures toward bride and groom) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">these two</span> have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Is it, perhaps, their physical appearance? His rugged handsomeness? Her stunning beauty?</p>
<p>What about their relationship? Is the wedding great because of the intensity of their love for one another? Their glorious dreams for the future? The optimism of this moment between them?</p>
<p><em><strong>What is it that makes a wedding great?</strong></em></p>
<p>I guess, if most of us had to pick, we’d say that a wedding is great <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if the bride is happy</span>. Right? I mean, even if the weather stinks, the singers are off-key, and the sermon is just absolutely awful – if the bride is happy, everything is OK. Right?</p>
<p>Which is a great reminder that <strong>weddings are about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people</span>, not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">performances</span>.</strong></p>
<p>However, I’m here today to tell you all that, sure, you can have a <em><strong>good</strong></em> wedding if the <em><strong>bride</strong></em> is happy.</p>
<p>But, <strong>if you want a really great wedding – if you want a really great marriage – then it’s really all about the <u>groom</u></strong>.</p>
<h4 id="great-weddings-might-i-even-say-heavenly-weddings-are-all-about-the-groom"><u>Great</u> weddings, might I even say <em>heavenly</em> weddings, are all about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>groom</strong></span>.</h4>
<p>Now, either you’re not listening or I’ve probably upset you!</p>
<p>Really? Has the preacher lost his mind? Is he some sort of chauvinist pig?</p>
<p>This is the bride’s big day! That’s why her outfit is more impressive! That’s why we all stand when the bride walks down the aisle!</p>
<p>Are we really going to take this moment away from her and say that it’s all about this handsome chump here?</p>
<p>Well, <strong>no.</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly weddings <em><strong>are</strong></em> all about the groom, but you (gestures to the groom) better <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>not</strong></em></span> use this sermon as an excuse for anything resembling male chauvinism!</p>
<p>Because, for one thing, I’m an egalitarian!</p>
<p>And, for another, I’m not talking about <strong>you</strong> (gestures to groom), <em><strong>her</strong></em> (to bride) bridegroom, but rather to <strong><u>Christ</u></strong>, <em><strong>our</strong></em> (gestures to everyone) bridegroom.</p>
<h4 id="great-weddings-and-great-marriages-are-all-about-christ-our-bridegroom"><strong>Great weddings, and great marriages, are all about Christ, our Bridegroom.</strong></h4>
<p>Take a glance at the Bible readings on your order of service everyone.</p>
<p>Did you catch the names on the wedding invite in Revelation 19? We’re not invited there to this wedding, of this woman to this man, but the wedding of the <strong>Church</strong> to <strong>Christ</strong> himself!</p>
<p>This is the same marriage Paul speaks of in Ephesians 5. In both passages, the Groom, Christ, takes center stage.</p>
<p>You see, in the ancient Jewish culture out of which the Bible came, weddings were done a bit differently.</p>
<p>Modern weddings often center around the arrival of the <strong>bride</strong> to her groom, but these ancient Jewish weddings really hinged on the arrival of the <strong>groom</strong> to his bride.</p>
<p>First, what would happen is the groom would pay the bride’s father her bride price.</p>
<p>After this, the couple was betrothed – legally joined together, although not physically, for they still were not fully married.</p>
<p>Instead, they went their separate ways. He went to prepare their future living quarters as an addition to his father’s household. She went back to her father’s household to prepare <strong>herself</strong> – including the preparation of her beautiful wedding dress.</p>
<p>After the groom had completed their home, he would gather his friends to go and get his bride. She and her companions would have a ballpark idea of when he would come, but the exact hour was a surprise. So, <strong>the bridal party had to stay ready.</strong></p>
<p>This is the scene we read in Matthew 25, where things went <strong>wrong</strong>. Five members of the bridal party were ready for the bridegroom to arrive, but the other five were not ready to join the evening’s lamp-lit procession.</p>
<p>Ideally, the bride and all her friends and family would be awake and ready to join the groom on the journey back to his father’s household and their new living quarters. Once there, the real party began!</p>
<p>Which, by the way, if things have sounded real intense up to this point, let me assure you: these people knew how to party! The wedding celebration would go on for days and days, launching the couple into their new life together.</p>
<p>Now, why in the world am I telling you all this? I mean, first I steal the bride’s thunder, and then I give you a Jewish history lesson?!</p>
<p>Here’s why (looks directly at bride and groom): <strong>your wedding, and your marriage to each other, finds its true meaning and glory as a part of Christ’s Bride – the Church – preparing herself for the Bridegroom’s return.</strong></p>
<h4 id="great-weddings-and-marriages-are-all-about-the-bridegroom"><em><strong>Great weddings and marriages are all about the Bridegroom.</strong></em></h4>
<p>What does that mean for you? Well, as we read in Ephesians 5, it means <strong>you are to love each other sacrificially and humbly</strong>.</p>
<p>After all, our Bridegroom died for us. He cleanses us from sin. And he sets us apart as his holy people. Will your marriage be an image of this kind of love for each other?</p>
<p>Look around the room, you two.</p>
<p>Now look at each other.</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say that you will each bring the other more <strong>joy</strong> than anyone else in this room. However, I think it’s also safe to say that you will cause each other more <strong>pain</strong> than anyone else in this room.</p>
<p>Because you are sinners.</p>
<p>You each, like us all, have fallen short of the glory of God. And marriage is about to make you especially aware of your spouse’s sinful flaws!</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, that’s not the end of the story. Thankfully, <strong>your marriage can point beyond itself</strong>, and therefore be truly <strong>heavenly</strong>.</p>
<p>For you both have been <strong>bought</strong> by the very blood of Christ – a steep bride price if there ever was one!</p>
<p>You have both been <strong>betrothed</strong> to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who is preparing a place for you both in his Father’s household.</p>
<p>And you are therefore both called to <strong>prepare</strong> your wedding garments through holy living – especially in how you <strong>love</strong> one another as husband as wife.</p>
<p>Should you love each other as Christ loves his Bride, your marriage will be a powerful witness – through both laughter and tears – to a world which desperately needs the Bridegroom. It desperately needs the Bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong, and to make everything <strong>new</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you know what that’s going to be like?</p>
<p>It’s going to be like <strong>a wedding banquet</strong>.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21(:2-4), John writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a <em><strong>bride</strong></em> beautifully dressed for her husband.</p>
<p>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.</p>
<p>‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, we can anticipate that <strong>joy</strong> and <strong>celebration</strong> at the reception later today!</p>
<p>But we also get a glimpse of what’s coming when we partake of the <strong>Lord’s Supper</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as God has not left the two of your alone, but has blessed you with each other’s companionship, <strong>Jesus has not left his Church on her own</strong>, but promises to <strong>be with her</strong> in the breaking of the bread and the sharing of the wine.</p>
<p>Therefore, every time someone comes into contact with you as a Christ-centered couple, I pray they are reminded of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And every time the two of you, and all of you, partake of the Lord’s Supper, I pray you’ll remember that <strong>heavenly weddings, and the very best marriages, are all about the Bridegroom</strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-would-it-have-been-like-on-the-first-holy-saturday"><strong>What would it have been like, on the first Holy Saturday?</strong></h3>
<p>What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?</p>
<p>All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.</p>
<p>And so, some sorry snots get up to try and encourage us. They open up the Hebrew Scriptures and read about our great God.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, when He made the heavens, earth, and humans?</li>
<li>Remember, when He rescued Noah?</li>
<li>Remember, when he stayed Abraham’s knife-laden hand?</li>
<li>Remember, when he rescued us from Egypt?</li>
<li>Remember, when he promised to bring us back from exile, restore our fortunes, and open our… graves?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s too much, too soon. Shut up and sit down! Leave us mourn and weep awhile! Jesus is dead! The one we thought would save us is dead!</p>
<p>It’s been over a day. It’s been almost 2,000 years.</p>
<p><strong>Can these bones live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can these bones live?</strong></p>
<p>The question haunts us. The answer is so obviously “No! Of course not! They’re bones! No flesh, no breath, no life!”</p>
<p>And yet, God asks Ezekiel. And He asks us. Can these bones live?</p>
<p>And sure, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.</p>
<p>Can these bones live? Can <strong>Christ’s</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Surely this question must have flickered in someone’s mind on the first Holy Saturday. And, yes, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.</p>
<p>Look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">world</span>! Dealing in death, day by day. Wars. Famines. Floods. Diseases. Droughts. Death.</p>
<p>Can <strong>these</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Church</span>! Claiming with her lips to follow Jesus Christ, and yet so often proving with her life that she wants no such thing. Scandal. Hypocrisy. Idolatry.</p>
<p>Can <strong>these</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yourselves</span>! I’ll be honest, the question “can these bones live?” is put to every preacher facing a congregation! If the Spirit doesn’t move, I’m throwing hot air at dry bones!</p>
<p>Can <strong>your</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>But then, look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>! Just as scandalous, hypocritical, and idolatrous as any – and yet here I stand, presuming to proclaim the Word of God to you.</p>
<p>Who do I think I am? Can <strong>my</strong> bones live?</p>
<p><strong>Can all these dry, dead bones live?</strong></p>
<p>Friends, there’s a reason why we’re here, though it’s so dark, so late. Sure, it’s to bring in, bright and oh so early, the celebration of Easter.</p>
<p>But it’s also because <strong>keeping vigil is what the Church does every day</strong>. We keep vigil for the sake of a suffering and dying world. We keep watch for our bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong. We stay awake at the world’s late hour, surrounded by so many dry, dead bones.</p>
<p>Can these bones live?</p>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> They can. But, what do they need in order to do so?</p>
<p>First, they need some WATER. Did you notice how often water has appeared in tonight’s readings?</p>
<ul>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">creation</span>, out of which God called the dry ground – out of which He formed human beings.</li>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">judgment</span>, through which God saved Noah and his family in the Ark.</li>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">redemption</span>, through which God rescued Israel from the Egyptian house of slavery.</li>
<li>And the waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cleansing</span>, by which the Lord promised in the prophets to wash away His people’s guilty stains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Water, water, everywhere! Except the dry valley.</p>
<p>I think the dry bones need some sort of <strong>water</strong>.</p>
<p>They also need some sort of SPIRIT. You know, God’s Spirit, His breath, His wind, who hovered over the waters at creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who filled the first humans with life.</li>
<li>Who led God’s people.</li>
<li>Who inspired and preserved the words of Scripture we read this evening.</li>
<li>Who rushed upon the dry bones in Ezekiel’s vision – making them into a great army, alive!</li>
</ul>
<p>Dry bones need the <strong>Spirit</strong>.</p>
<p>But, the question isn’t “Can these bones get <strong>wet</strong> and <strong>windy</strong>?” It’s “Can they <strong>LIVE</strong>?!”</p>
<p>And, if they’re going to live, they’re going to need a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>RESURRECTION</strong></em></span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>They need the defeat of their most ancient enemy: Death!</li>
<li>They need Death’s reversal! They need Death’s death!</li>
<li>They need exactly what God promised Ezekiel: to open their graves, and lift them up, living!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amen! Glory, glory, hallelujah!</strong></p>
<p>But, if I hear Ezekiel’s glorious vision read at the first Holy Saturday, I’m tempted to <strong>lose it</strong> at this point. To bitterly ask those gathered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>When</strong>?! That sounds great, but <strong>when</strong>?! <strong>When</strong> is God going to do this?!</p>
<p>For over <strong>five hundred years</strong> since Ezekiel, we’ve been falling into our graves over and over again – and staying there! Sure, it’s no longer in Babylon, but we’ve been invaded and harassed and dominated here in Judah ever since!</p>
<p>Is it really that much better to fall into the grave under Rome’s heavy heel, like Jesus?</p>
<p>Why not Babylon’s?</p>
<p>Why not Assyria’s?</p>
<p>Heck, why not Pharaoh’s?</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> is God going to turn things around?!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, I wasn’t in the audience back then. But we’re here, tonight. And maybe you’re similarly tempted to lose it and freak out sometimes in church!</p>
<p>All this pretty Jesus-talk, when for over 2,000 years the Church has travailed in the midst of a deadly and dying world.</p>
<p>We thank Jesus for our oversized meals, cars, and houses, while thousands fall into their graves around us – tired, hungry, destitute, and alone.</p>
<p>So, on the first Holy Saturday and the 2,000th, the question is roughly the same:</p>
<p><strong>When</strong>?! <strong>When</strong> is God going to turn things around?!</p>
<p>And the answer is likewise the same. We sang it, earlier:</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS THE NIGHT.</strong></p>
<p>When did God open the grave?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>THIS IS THE NIGHT</strong>, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So, <strong>can these bones live? Yes!</strong></p>
<p>Can <strong>Christ’s</strong> bones live? Yes! For on this night, some 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ got up from the tomb. He was alive. He was dead. But he is now alive again.</p>
<p>Can <strong>our</strong> bones live? Yes!</p>
<p>How? Because Christ has provided the <strong>resurrection</strong>, the <strong>Spirit</strong>, and the <strong>water</strong> we need.</p>
<p>Because, through the waters of <strong>baptism</strong>, we receive the Spirit and the resurrection.</p>
<p>Now, we aren’t going to baptize anyone tonight. We’ll have to wait until later this morning to do so. But we are about to renew our baptismal vows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>preserved</strong>, like Noah, from the waters of Sin and Death, in the Ark, the Church.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>ransomed</strong> and rescued, like Israel, through the waters of the Red Sea.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>cleansed</strong> with the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, as God promised through Isaiah and Ezekiel.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>buried</strong> with Christ in his death, and are <strong>raised</strong> with him in newness of life.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>empowered</strong> and <strong>emboldened</strong> to <strong>proclaim</strong> the good news to a desperate world that JESUS CHRIST IS RISEN.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we can assure the world that their bones can live, because <strong>Christ has died</strong>.</p>
<p>We can rest assured that our bones can live, because <strong>Christ is risen</strong>.</p>
<p>And we can keep watch for the sake of a suffering world, because <strong>Jesus Christ will come again</strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <title>Three Recent Sermons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a grueling past few weeks at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson&lt;/a&gt;. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can’t come quickly enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have preached twice in the past month on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032&#34;&gt;Psalm 32&lt;/a&gt;. First, I delivered a sermon (“The Refreshment of Forgiveness”) designed for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearC_RCL/Lent/CLent4_RCL.html&#34;&gt;Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C&lt;/a&gt;, for Dr. Doug Webster’s Preaching Practicum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a grueling past few weeks at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson</a>. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can’t come quickly enough!</p>
<p>Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!</p>
<p>I have preached twice in the past month on <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032">Psalm 32</a>. First, I delivered a sermon (“The Refreshment of Forgiveness”) designed for the <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearC_RCL/Lent/CLent4_RCL.html">Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C</a>, for Dr. Doug Webster’s Preaching Practicum.</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249090987″ params=”color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>
<p>Then, I preached/presented on the same passage for Dr. Allen Ross’s Exegesis of Psalms (“Psalm 32: Psalm 1 for Screw-Ups”).</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248878329″ params=”color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>
<p>Preparing and preaching these very <strong>different</strong> sermons on the <strong>same</strong> passage was a good reminder of the inexhaustible richness of Scripture.</p>
<p>Most recently, I got to compose a “crisis sermon” for Dr. Webster’s Preaching Practicum (“Lamenting into Worship”). One of my classmates preached a post-9/11 sermon. Another, post-Pearl Harbor! These were great sermons, but I chose a different route: <strong>preaching to a congregation after the death of a well-known church family’s baby</strong>.</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249874403″ params=”color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>
<p>This was a stretching experience, to say the least. I pray I never have to preach this sermon in real life, but it was a good reminder to preach the good news to myself that God hates death more than we do.</p>
<p>You can listen to and/or read “The Refreshment of Forgiveness,” “Psalm 1 for Screw-Ups,” and “Lamenting into Worship,” along with my other sermons <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/sermons/">at the <strong>Sermons Page</strong> of this site</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there are much better preachers out there in the world, so if you’re short on time, go listen to them preach! But, if you’ve got the time to give these sermons a listen, I would greatly appreciate your <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/contact/"><strong>feedback</strong> </a>as I try to improve as a preacher and teacher of God’s Word!</p>

<h1 id="i-introduction-the-prodigal-son-part-2">I. Introduction: The Prodigal Son, Part 2</h1>
<p>What a relief, to get out of that house.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey!</p>
<p>But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that <em>prodigal</em>) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.</p>
<p>So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.</p>
<p>But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.</p>
<p>“Dad has <em><u>changed</u></em>. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the <u>only</u> son. Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally <u>proud</u> of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.</p>
<p>And then Ethan threw it all away.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what, as it that weren’t bad enough, <u>dad</u> threw it all away…<u>for</u> Ethan.</p>
<p>He received much more love than I ever did.</p>
<p>I used to get punished for much slighter infractions than throwing my entire life (along with our hard-earned savings) away!</p>
<p>I never got a <em>banquet</em> when I broke Sabbath…I got a <em>beating</em>!”</p>
<p>At this point, Jude’s unpleasant thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the homestead on the horizon.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the amount of trash bags on the front porch.</p>
<p>Not much later, the smell hit him. Odors he’d only ever experienced in faraway marketplaces, and therefore that much more memorable.</p>
<p>Barely believing his eyes and his nose, Jude took a closer look at the trash.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grilled pork chop remnants.</li>
<li>Crusty booze bottles.</li>
<li>Bacon pizza fragments.</li>
<li>Ashen cigarette butts.</li>
<li>The slimy shells of shellfish.</li>
</ul>
<p>His blood pressure rising, Jude spit on the refuse-pile and stormed in the front door.</p>
<p>“Dad! Where are you!? He’s done it again! Brought his dirty Gentile friends into our home! Dad?!”</p>
<p>A very obviously hungover Ethan stumbled into the main room, nibbling on a piece of bacon. “Jude! You’re back…”</p>
<p>And Jude <strong><u>broke</u></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Ethan! You <em>ethnoi</em>, you <u>Gentiles</u>!</p>
<p>How can you continually scorn <u>our</u> father’s, <u>the</u> Father’s, <strong><u>righteousness</u></strong>!?</p>
<p>First, you go and throw away your life and our life-savings to <strong>run away with swine</strong>?!</p>
<p>Then, after the Father <em><strong>somehow</strong></em> took you in – adopted you like some bastard, orphaned children – <em><strong>you bring the swine back into this house?!</strong></em></p>
<p>You think you’re so <u>strong</u>, so <u>powerful</u>, but you’re <strong>weak</strong>!</p>
<p>You think you know <u>who the Father is</u>, <u>what he’s like</u>, but you’re <strong>wrong</strong>!</p>
<p>We’re <u>strong</u>! We’re the <u>firstborn sons</u> of God!</p>
<p><em><strong>Who in the hell do you Gentiles think you are?!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>If you really loved God, you would <u>follow</u> the Law and <u>keep</u> the traditions…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>How can the Father love you? It’s embarrassing, really.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We never should have allowed you back into this <u>house</u></strong></em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>By now, Ethan was boiling over as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“Damn you, Jude! You Judaioi, you Jews!</strong></em></p>
<p>How can you continually forget <u>our</u> father, <u>the</u> Father’s <strong><u>grace</u></strong>?!</p>
<p>Don’t you realize by now that all your stupid <u>rituals</u>, all your hard <u>lessons</u> learned, were <strong><u>a complete waste of time</u></strong>!?</p>
<p>We Gentiles and God have moved on into the <strong><u>age of grace</u></strong>!</p>
<p>You Jews have FORGOTTEN the point of God’s grace, and so <u>He’s practically forgotten you</u>!</p>
<p>We’re the <u>firstborn</u>, <u>best-loved</u> sons now.</p>
<p>We’re the <u>strong</u> ones, and we <u>outnumber</u> you all at least three to one, so <strong>shut up and deal with it</strong>!</p>
<p>You’ve SCREWED UP so often, you got KICKED OUT of your land!</p>
<p>And you didn’t learn any lessons then, because you got yourselves THROWN OUT of Rome!</p>
<p><em><strong>How could Nero have let you back into this city? It’s shameful, really.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We never should have allowed you back into this Church, you…”</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]</p>
<p>Someone at the door.</p>
<p>The Roman Christians – Jew and Gentile alike – froze in fear.</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong> looked at the other <strong>Gentile leaders.</strong></p>
<p>Was it a centurion? Had their gathering been reported? Would they be asked to bow the knee, to offer a sacrifice, to the new emperor, Nero? If they weren’t willing to do so, would this be the end?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong> glanced at his wife, their children, and the other <strong>Jewish families.</strong></p>
<p>Had they already outstayed their recent welcome back to the city? After exile, they’d spent four hard, hard years rebuilding their life in Rome. Would they again be driven from their homes? Where would they go?</p>
<p>The <strong>slaves</strong> in the room – and there were <u>many</u> – anxiously retraced their steps throughout the day.</p>
<p>Which one of their fellow slaves had discovered their secret? Had followed them to this meeting? Had told their master? Would they merely get whipped again? Or had their master’s patience run out?</p>
<p>Jude whispered to Ethan, “You’re in charge here, get the door.”</p>
<p>He trudged to the threshold and pulled it open.</p>
<p>A hooded figure stepped through, walked to the middle of the room, and pulled the hood back.</p>
<p>Long brown hair flowed down.</p>
<p>The woman said <strong>“Christ is Risen!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“…He is…risen…indeed,”</strong> they all stammered in reply.</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“He is risen indeed. For twenty-five years now, in fact!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greetings. My name is Phoebe of Cenchreae.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Rummaging in her pack, she began to explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I bring something for all of you from Paul, the apostle…</strong></p>
<p><strong>It’s in here, somewhere. Not this theology textbook. Not this to-do list…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ah! Here it is, a <u>letter</u>.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>After carefully opening the document, she began to read the following words.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, her first audience didn’t have the benefit of reading these words off a page, but that’s no excuse for you not to follow along in your Bible, if you’ve got it with you.</p>
<p>Open up to Romans 1, and as I read these words, imagine Phoebe reading them for the first time to a room full of Roman Christians.</p>
<p>Reading these words like she was convinced they were absolutely true.</p>
<p>She began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ our Lord,<sup> </sup>through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles, among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called as saints:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God’s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you — that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.</strong></p>
<p><strong><sup> </sup>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, although that concludes the chunk of Romans we’ll consider today, Phoebe went on to read the rest of the <u>7,114 Greek words</u> in the letter.</p>
<p>And, as far as we know, as the one to deliver this letter, she would have also been its first <u>interpreter</u>. That is, she would have answered the <u>questions</u> of the first audience regarding what had been read.</p>
<p>Now, despite Paul’s wide influence in the early Church, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that at least one woefully-uninformed Christian at Rome would have raised his hand and asked: <strong>“Who is Paul?”</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>I mean, Who <u>was</u> Paul, really?</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="ii-from-paul">II. From Paul</h1>
<p>Well, as sister Phoebe mentioned, about <u>twenty-five years</u> separated the <u>Resurrection</u> of our Lord Jesus Christ and <u>Paul’s penning</u> of the letter to the Christians at Rome in 57, 58 AD.</p>
<p>If you wanted to find <strong>Paul</strong> in the <u>same year</u> that Jesus of Nazareth walked out of his grave, you might be a bit frustrated as you repeatedly flip through the “P” section of your Palestinian Phonebook. Because, see, <em><strong><u>Saul</u></strong></em>, of Tarsus, is your guy.</p>
<p>And, like some others whose names have changed, Paul had a <strong><u>past</u></strong>.</p>
<p>He’d <strong><u>done some things</u></strong>.</p>
<p>And I’m not going to spoil this with some alliterated list. I’ll let Paul tell you about his past:</p>
<p>In Acts 22:3-4, he says, if you’ll indulge the paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I’m a Jew. Sure, I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up right here in Jerusalem, educated in Dr. Gamaliel’s strict, strict seminary to learn and live the Law of Moses. I was just as zealous for God as any Jew. How zealous? I persecuted this Way, these Christians, to the death! I’d throw any of them I could, men or women, into prison!”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In Acts 26:5b, 9-11, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I wasn’t just any zealous Jew, either. I was a Pharisee! […] I hated and opposed the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Jerusalem was my first Christian-hunting ground! I asked my superiors for permission, then threw those Christians in jail! And when it was time for their death-row judgment, I always cast a kill-vote. Just for fun, sometimes, I’d try to trip them up in synagogue – ask them just the right theological questions to get them to show their heretical cards. But deep down, I hated them. When they fled Jerusalem, I pursued them.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In Galatians 1:13-14, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10px;line-height:10px;">“</span>You know what I did in my Jewish-only days, how I tried to wipe the church of God from the face of the earth. I was climbing the rungs of Judaism faster than anyone else my age. I was more zealous for the traditions than any of my old seminary buddies.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In Philippians 3:5-6, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I was circumcised, I was as Hebrew as Hebrew could be; as to the law, a righteous Pharisee – no one followed it better!; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church;”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:13, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I once was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent.</strong></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Jew.</li>
<li>A Pharisee.</li>
<li>A blasphemer.</li>
<li>A persecutor.</li>
<li>An insolent opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Such was Saul of Tarsus.</strong></em></p>
<p>And YET, here, Paul, to the Christians at Rome, declares himself, <u>first</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2 id="a-slave"><em><strong>A SLAVE.</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as previously, to his own <u>zeal for the traditions</u> and the so-called “righteousness” of the Law of Moses.</p>
<p>But a SLAVE of CHRIST JESUS. Taking orders from the one whose name he had <u>previously</u> and <u>viciously</u> endeavored to <u>oppose</u>!</p>
<p>Paul declares himself, second:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2 id="called"><em><strong>CALLED</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as he had previously supposed, to <u>persecute the Church</u>.</p>
<p>But to <u>plant churches</u>! To serve the church as an APOSTLE, as an ambassador, as an envoy – with a message from his master, Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>A slave. Called an apostle. Paul declares himself, third:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2 id="set-apart"><em><strong>SET APART</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as previously, for the sake of the Law as a Pharisee, which literally meant “one set apart.”</p>
<p>But set apart for the sake of the GOSPEL! The good news regarding his master!</p>
<p>Paul wants to <u>serve</u> the Church at Rome by <strong>preaching the gospel</strong> there, in order to <u>strengthen them spiritually</u>. This <u>letter</u> to the Romans will preach the gospel <u>in his stead</u> until he can do so <strong>face to face.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No longer a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But now a slave, an apostle, set apart for the gospel…Such was Paul!</strong></p>
<p>**Quite the transition! Don’t you think?**</p>
<p>It almost make us wonder:</p>
<p>“<strong>What could be <u>powerful</u> enough to <u>transform</u> someone like this?</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>What could be <u>powerful</u> enough to <u>transform</u> someone like this?</strong>”</p>
<p><u>But</u>…c’mon, we’re not studying Paul himself. We’re taking a look at <strong><u>Romans</u></strong>, remember? And, while no one would have asked sister Phoebe this question back then, we need to ask it today:</p>
<p><em><strong>**Who <u>were</u> the Romans? Who <u>were</u> these Christians at Rome?**</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="iii-to-the-roman-christians"><strong>III. To the Roman Christians</strong></h1>
<p>Well, like everyone, name-change or not, they had a <u>past</u>.</p>
<p>At <u>one</u> time – the Jews and the Gentiles alike – were both <strong><u>faithless</u></strong>. They were more or less <u>groping</u> along in the darkness until they came to know Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<p><u>Now, we don’t know much</u> about how Christianity first spread westward from Jerusalem to the center of the Roman Empire. However, it was <u>probably</u> taken there by Jewish Christians – perhaps by the Jewish “visitors from Rome” who, according to Acts 2:10, were present at Pentecost.</p>
<p>Regardless, those Christians present in Rome when Phoebe arrived were, in general, <strong>no longer <u>completely</u> faithless.</strong> After all, Jesus the Messiah had <u>enough</u> of a claim on their lives for them to risk attending <u>a potentially unpopular meeting</u>.</p>
<p>And yet, much like Saul had been <strong>ashamed</strong> of the <u>Jews</u> who had chosen to follow a <u>crucified Messiah</u> (…not to mention how much that Pharisee would have been ashamed of Gentile sinners!)…</p>
<p>Now, not just <u>annoyed</u>, or <u>irritated</u>. But ashamed. Embarrassed. Disgusted by the very existence of something, because it is humiliating.</p>
<p><u>Come on and feel</u> this for a second. We know what it’s like, <strong>to look in the mirror, to look back into our past, and feel gut-wrenching shame – at our high-handed sins, our careless words, our lies and our lusts. Because we’ve DONE some things. We have a PAST.</strong></p>
<p><em>**Shameful, really.**</em></p>
<p>Well…Much like the previous Paul, the Christians at Rome were <strong><u>ashamed</u></strong>.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, they were at least <u>tempted</u> to be ashamed of a <u>Savior</u> who didn’t exactly live up to the Roman ideals of <strong>power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>. This was real, this was raw. It may have been a bit <u>embarrassing</u> sometimes, to walk by the <u>huge buildings</u> and <u>striking soldiers</u> of the Empire to go and worship in secret a guy who had been</p>
<ul>
<li>mocked,</li>
<li>beaten,</li>
<li>stripped naked,</li>
<li>and nailed to a tree</li>
<li>until he died like a common criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ashamed, of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Second, they were ashamed of <strong><u>each other</u>.</strong></p>
<p>I hope my, admittedly apocryphal introduction gave you at least a <u>taste</u> of what it <u>could</u> have been like to be a Christian at Rome. Based on <u>historical evidence</u> and what Paul has to say at the <u>end</u> of this letter, we can surmise that the Roman church <u>shifted</u> from <u>predominantly <strong>Jewish</strong></u> to predominantly <strong>Gentile</strong>.</p>
<p><u>Positively</u>, this could have happened through <strong>new Gentile converts</strong>. <u>Negatively</u>, Emperor <strong>Claudius</strong> expelled the Jews from the city of Rome in <strong>AD 49</strong> due to a Jewish dispute about Christ. <strong>Acts 18:2</strong> mentions <strong>Priscilla</strong> and <strong>Aquila</strong> as two of the Jews thus exiled. With <u>most</u> of the Jews forced to leave the city, the churches would have become <strong>predominantly Gentile</strong>.</p>
<p>However, after Claudius’ death in <strong>AD 54</strong>, the Jews began to return to Rome under the new emperor, <strong>Nero</strong>. …To return to churches now <u>led by</u> and <u>populated with</u> <strong>Gentiles</strong> – Gentiles who no longer followed certain restrictions in the Mosaic Law.</p>
<p><strong>Jewish</strong> Christians were ashamed of their libertine <strong>Gentile</strong> brothers and sisters in Christ. How could these people so quickly forget the Jewish origins of their faith?</p>
<p><strong>Gentile</strong> Christians were ashamed of their <strong>Jewish</strong> brothers and sisters in Christ, because they were <em><strong>personae non gratae</strong></em> – <strong>unwelcome persons – to many Romans.</strong> They only <u>increased</u> the risk that the next knock on the door would be an unhappy centurion.</p>
<p><strong>Ashamed</strong> and <strong>divided</strong>. Such were <u>the Christians at Rome</u>.</p>
<p>And yet Paul writes to them, to <strong><u>call</u></strong> them – as <u>Christ</u> had called them – to something <em><strong><u>better</u></strong></em>. What was it?</p>
<p>The <strong><u>“obedience of faith”</u></strong> – and here <u>Paul’s</u> transformation links up with <u>theirs</u>.</p>
<p>Look at what he says in verse 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>through Christ <strong>“we have received grace and apostleship</strong> (Paul’s transformation) <strong>to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles</strong> (the Roman Christians’ transformation)”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, what does this <em><strong>obedience of faith</strong></em>, this <strong><u>obedient faithfulness</u></strong>, if you will, <strong>look like</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest with you, Paul doesn’t have <u>much</u> to say about this in these introductory paragraphs. <strong>He’s starting his audience off on a long trajectory</strong>, but he does <strong>return</strong> to the obedience of faith at the end of this letter! The exact phrase appears in the letter’s last sentence, in fact.</p>
<p>But the idea of obedient faithfulness appears a bit earlier.</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapters 1-3,</u></strong> we see what the <strong>opposite</strong> of obedient faithfulness looks like. At the end of chapter 3, we see what <strong>God’s saving faithfulness</strong> looks like (…It looks like Jesus!)</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapter 4</u></strong>, we see that obedient faithfulness still looked pretty similar in the Old Testament – with father <em><strong><u>Abraham</u></strong></em>, of whom it’s said in verses 20-21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in faith as he gave glory to God, (even before he was circumcised, mind you), fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><u>In chapters 5-8</u></strong>, we see various facets of God’s saving faithfulness as the foundation of our obedient faithfulness.</p>
<p><strong><u>In chapters 9-11</u></strong>, we are reminded that there is HOPE for obedient faithfulness among the Jewish people, because God remains utterly faithful to his promises.</p>
<p>And, I suggest to you that Paul refers to this <em><strong>obedient faithfulness</strong></em> in the well-known beginning of chapter 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your <u>spiritual worship</u>,”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>or your “<em><strong>rational service</strong></em>,” or your “<em><strong>obedient faithfulness</strong></em>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In <strong>the rest of</strong> <strong><u>chapter 12</u></strong>, we find out that obedient faithfulness looks like <strong><u>humility</u></strong> (12:3-8) and love (12:9-21).</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapter 13</u></strong>, we find out what <strong><u>humility</u></strong> and <strong><u>love</u></strong> look like when translated from another person to an impersonal government.</p>
<p>And then <strong><u>in chapters 14 and 15</u></strong> we get to the pastoral heart of Paul’s letter. The <strong>Christians at Rome were letting holy days and food laws come between them</strong>.</p>
<p>I find two verses of rebuke especially poignant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Romans 14:15 – <strong>“For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.”</strong></li>
<li>Romans 14:20 – <strong>“Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what I’m getting at: Paul calls the <u>ashamed</u> and <u>divided</u> Christians at Rome to the <strong><u>obedient faithfulness of UNITY</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Consider 15:5-7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,<sup> </sup>that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Think about it: this is a far cry from Jude and Ethan’s passionate argument at the beginning! Again, we must ask:</p>
<p><em><strong>What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?</strong></em></p>
<p>The same thing that was powerful enough to change Saul to Paul: <em><strong><u>the gospel.</u></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><u>What is the gospel?</u></strong></em></p>
<h1 id="iv-through-the-gospel">IV. Through the Gospel</h1>
<p>Well, much like God’s people, including Paul and the Roman Christians, God’s gospel <strong><u>has a past</u></strong>.</p>
<p>See, it was once a <u>partial promise to the people of Israel</u>. Writing to his divided and divisive audience of Jew and Gentile Christians, Paul begins with the gospel’s Jewish roots:</p>
<p>Look at verses 2-3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God had promised the gospel <strong>“beforehand through his prophets in the holy [Hebrew] Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Jewish mission.</li>
<li>A Jewish hope.</li>
<li>A Son of David, in <u>human flesh.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>But how is this <u>powerful</u> enough to <strong>transform</strong>?</p>
<p>How does this <u>Jewish</u> mission have a claim on the faithful obedience of the <strong>Gentiles</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>**Because the Son of <u>David</u> is the Son of <u>God</u>.**</strong></p>
<p>The one <u>born</u>, and <u>crucified</u>, in the <u>weakness</u> of human flesh, is <strong>RAISED</strong> by the Holy Spirit in the <strong>power</strong> of <strong>resurrection</strong>! And this powerfully risen Messiah is the <strong><u>LORD</u></strong>. The <strong><u>Lord</u></strong> over more than Emperor Nero’s puny Roman playground. He is the Lord of heaven and earth! Of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p>You know, <u>merely</u> <u>crucified</u> Messiah is a <em><strong>poor</strong></em> Messiah indeed – worthy of <em><strong><u>shame</u></strong></em>. But a RISEN Messiah is a TRUE Messiah – worthy of <em><strong><u>obedience</u></strong></em> and <em><strong><u>faithfulness</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>Paul is therefore not ashamed of the gospel, because he recognizes its resurrection <strong>power</strong> – a power to <u>save</u> and <u>transform</u> <strong>ALL</strong> those who believe – both Jews and Gentiles who <u>trust</u> that <strong>Jesus Christ is who he says he is – the Son of God!</strong>,</p>
<p>Who <u>trust</u> that <strong>he has done what he set out to do –</strong> <strong>to <u>save</u> and to <u>redeem</u> through his life, death, resurrection and ascension.</strong></p>
<p>The gospel is therefore powerful enough to <u>save</u> and <u>transform</u> all those who <strong><u>trust</u></strong> that <strong>God is who he says he is</strong> – which is to say all those who <strong><u>believe</u></strong> that God himself is <strong><u>righteous</u></strong>.</p>
<p>He is <strong><u>faithful to keep his promises</u></strong> – his <strong><u>covenants</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to Adam,</li>
<li>to Noah,</li>
<li>to Abraham,</li>
<li>to Moses,</li>
<li>to David,</li>
<li>to Jeremiah,</li>
<li>and to all of creation –</li>
</ul>
<p>his <em><strong><u>promises</u></strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>to put the world back together again,</li>
<li>to not let Sin and Death have the final word,</li>
<li>but to <u>raise</u> his people from their graves,</li>
<li>to <u>melt</u> their hearts of stone,</li>
<li>to <u>breathe</u> breath, his <u>Spirit</u>, into their dry bones and lifeless flesh,</li>
<li>to bring the dead back to <u>life</u>,</li>
<li>to bring <u>US</u> back to life, read Romans 8!</li>
<li>to make the <u>faithless</u> ones <strong>faithful</strong>, to make <u>US</u> <strong>faithful</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>**God’s saving faithfulness to all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – through Jesus the Messiah calls forth, by the Holy Spirit, obedient faithfulness from all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – <u>to</u> Jesus the Messiah.**</strong></span></p>
<p>His <u>saving</u> faithfulness <strong>demands</strong> <u>obedient</u> faithfulness, and his Holy Spirit <strong>enables</strong> it.</p>
<p>God’s saving faithfulness <strong>demands</strong> and the Holy Spirit <strong>enables</strong> obedient faithfulness:</p>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as Paul says in 5:21,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as in 8:38,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“neither <u>death</u>, nor <u>life</u>, nor <u>angels</u>, nor <u>heavenly rulers</u>, nor things that are <u>present</u>, nor things to <u>come</u>, nor <u>powers</u>, nor <u>height</u>, nor <u>depth</u>, nor <u>anything</u> else in creation will be able to <u>separate</u> us from the <u>love</u> of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as in 15:5-6,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“the God of endurance and comfort [may] give you <u>unity</u> with one another in accordance with Christ Jesus, so that <u>together</u> you may with <u>one voice</u> glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<h1 id="v-conclusion-obedient-faithfulness-today">V. Conclusion: Obedient Faithfulness Today?</h1>
<p>Now, I’m speaking to a room full of <em><strong><u>seminarians</u></strong></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We <strong><u>know</u></strong> that the gospel is <u>powerful</u> enough to conquer Sin and Death.</li>
<li>We <strong><u>believe</u></strong> that the blood of Jesus is a <u>powerful</u> enough <u>detergent</u> to <strong>wash away our guilty stains.</strong></li>
<li>We <strong>feel an adrenaline rush</strong> when we read Romans 8:38,
<ul>
<li>because we <strong><u>trust</u></strong> that NOTHING will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We <strong><u>know</u></strong> that’s why Romans is so stinking long, why Paul couldn’t just start with chapter 14…</li>
<li>Because <strong><u>we know</u></strong> that the only thing <u>powerful</u> enough
<ul>
<li>to <strong>unite</strong> divided and ashamed Jews and Gentiles is the <strong>gospel</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We <strong><u>have faith</u></strong> that the gospel is powerful enough
<ul>
<li>to transform Saul into Paul,</li>
<li>to unite Jews and Gentiles, to transcend their divisions!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>***BUT: Do we have faith that the gospel is powerful enough to transcend OUR divisions?**</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>…Is the gospel powerful enough to transcend our differences?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>…Is the gospel powerful enough:</strong></em></p>
<p>To unite liturgy-loving Anglicans with Bible-thumping Baptists?</p>
<p>To bring together, in LOVE:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contemporary and the traditional,</li>
<li>The “smells and bells” with the seeker-sensitive,</li>
<li>The 1928 Prayer Books with the 1979 Prayer Books,</li>
<li>with the “What’s a Prayer Book?”s</li>
<li>The Lutherans and the Reformed</li>
<li>The Democrats and the Republicans</li>
<li>The Calvinists and the Arminians</li>
<li>The Blacks and the Whites</li>
<li>The Piperites and the N.T. Wrightians</li>
<li>The Latinos and the Asians</li>
<li>The egalitarians and complementarians</li>
<li>The rich and the poor</li>
<li>The paedobaptists and the credobaptists?</li>
</ul>
<p>…the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>“Do not destroy someone for whom Christ died.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of _______,</strong></p>
<p><strong>be it your prayer-book preferences or your theological idiosyncrasies.”</strong></p>
<p>See, Paul <strong><u>could</u></strong> have attempted to <u>unify</u> the Roman Christians by <strong>turning their faith in on itself</strong>. By encouraging them to <u>admire</u>, as if in a mirror, the <em><strong>surprising fact that their diverse church existed in the center of a pagan empire!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><u>But he did NOT do that! </u></strong></em></p>
<p>Instead, he maintained that the <u>gospel</u> reveals God’s righteousness <em><strong><u>“from faith to faith”</u></strong></em> –</p>
<p><strong>FROM</strong> the Faithful God <strong>TO</strong> his <em>previously</em> <strong>faithless</strong>, but <em>potentially</em> <strong>faithful</strong> and <strong>unified</strong>, people! <strong>FROM GOD TO US</strong></p>
<p>That <strong><u>order</u></strong> is important! <u>Because it will not do</u> to engage in <em><strong>ecclesiastical navel-gazing!</strong></em> We can’t just look at <u>ourselves</u> and marvel at the fact that <em><strong>our diverse seminary exists in the center of a pagan empire!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><u>No! We must look to Christ!</u></strong> For he himself is our <strong><u>peace</u></strong>, first with <u>God</u> and then with <u>one</u> <u>another</u>!</p>
<p>If we look at <u>one another</u>, before looking at <u>Christ</u>, and try to transcend our differences <u>on our own</u>, then <em><strong>we will inevitably become <u>ashamed</u> of one another</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em>Ashamed.</em></p>
<p><em>I can’t believe that God let some of y’all into his Church!</em></p>
<p>I’m embarrassed and frustrated by some of you. Sure, on my better days, I’ll admit you’re my brothers and sisters. But most days, we don’t feel much like siblings. Or maybe, we feel a bit TOO MUCH like human siblings, <u>bickering</u> and <u>nagging</u> and <u>fighting</u>.</p>
<p>And sure, I know I embarrass and frustrate some of you. And if that doesn’t apply to you <u>yet</u>, just <strong><u>wait</u></strong>! I’ll get there.</p>
<p>Friends, Sisters, Brothers, If we are <u>on our own</u> in this crazy thing called <strong>Church</strong>, it’s a hopeless, frustrating <em><strong><u>mess</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>But <u>if we trust that Paul knew what he was doing</u> when he began with the <strong>GOSPEL</strong> in this <u>lengthy pastoral letter to a <strong>divided</strong> church</u>,</p>
<p>If <u>we look to Christ Jesus</u> and <strong>trust</strong> that the gospel is <strong><u>powerful</u></strong> enough, not just to save, transform, and unify <em><strong>them</strong></em>, back <em><strong>then</strong></em>… but <strong>US, RIGHT NOW…</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>If we look to Christ and trust: </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Then,</u></strong> TOGETHER we <strong>“may with <u>one</u> voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Then,</u></strong> TOGETHER we may <strong>“<u>receive</u> one another, just as Christ also received [us], to God’s glory.”</strong></p>
<p>Then, TOGETHER we may <u>sing</u> and <u>believe</u> the words of the following hymn:</p>
<p>You’ve got a handout with the words. Would you stand and sing it with me?</p>
<p><strong>The Church’s one foundation<br>
Is Jesus Christ her Lord,<br>
She is His new creation<br>
By water and the Word.<br>
From heaven He came and sought her<br>
To be His holy bride;<br>
With His own blood He bought her<br>
And for her life He died.</strong></p>
<p><strong>She is from every nation,<br>
Yet one o’er all the earth;<br>
Her charter of salvation,<br>
One Lord, one faith, one birth;<br>
One holy Name she blesses,<br>
Partakes one holy food,<br>
And to one hope she presses,<br>
With every grace endued.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Though with a scornful wonder<br>
Men see her sore oppressed,<br>
By schisms rent asunder,<br>
By heresies distressed:<br>
Yet saints their watch are keeping,<br>
Their cry goes up, “How long?”<br>
And soon the night of weeping<br>
Shall be the morn of song!</strong></p>
<p><strong>’Mid toil and tribulation,<br>
And tumult of her war,<br>
She waits the consummation<br>
Of peace forevermore;<br>
Till, with the vision glorious,<br>
Her longing eyes are blest,<br>
And the great Church victorious<br>
Shall be the Church at rest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;relief&lt;/span&gt;, to get out of that house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey! But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand. But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">relief</span>, to get out of that house.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey! But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.</p>
<p>So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand. But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.</p>
<p>“Dad has <em><strong>changed</strong></em>. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span> son.</p>
<p>Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally <span style="text-decoration:underline;">proud</span> of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.</p>
<p>And then Ethan threw it all away.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what, as it that weren’t bad enough, dad threw it all away…<span style="text-decoration:underline;">for</span> Ethan!</p>
<p>He received <span style="text-decoration:underline;">much</span> more love than I ever did. I used to get punished for much slighter infractions than throwing my entire life (along with our hard-earned savings) away! I never got a <em>banquet</em> when I broke Sabbath…I got a <em>beating</em>!”</p>
<p>At this point, Jude’s unpleasant thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the homestead on the horizon.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the amount of trash bags on the front porch. Not much later, the smell hit him. Odors he’d only ever experienced in faraway marketplaces, and therefore that much more memorable.</p>
<p>Barely believing his eyes and his nose, Jude took a closer look at the trash.</p>
<p>Grilled pork chop remnants.</p>
<p>Crusty booze bottles.</p>
<p>Bacon pizza fragments.</p>
<p>Ashen cigarette butts.</p>
<p>The slimy shells of shellfish.</p>
<p>His blood pressure rising, Jude spit on the refuse-pile and stormed in the front door.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Dad! Where are you!? He’s done it again! Brought his dirty Gentile friends into our home! Dad?!”</strong></em></p>
<p>A very obviously hungover Ethan stumbled into the main room, nibbling on a piece of bacon. <em><strong>“Jude! You’re back…”</strong></em></p>
<p>And Jude <span style="text-decoration:underline;">broke</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Ethan! You <em>ethnoi</em>, you Gentiles! How can you continually scorn our father’s, the Father’s, righteousness!?</p>
<p>First, you go and throw away your life and our life-savings to run away with swine?! Then, after the Father somehow took you in – adopted you like some bastard, orphaned children – you bring the swine back into this house?!</p>
<p>You think you’re so strong, so powerful, but you’re <strong>weak</strong>! You think you know who the Father is, what he’s like, but you’re <strong>wrong</strong>!</p>
<p>We’re strong! We’re the firstborn sons of God! Who in the hell do you Gentiles think you are?!</p>
<p>If you really loved God, you would follow the Law and keep the traditions…</p>
<p>How can the Father love you people? It’s embarrassing, really.</p>
<p>We never should have allowed you back into this house.”</p></blockquote>
<p>By now, Ethan was boiling over as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Jude! You <em>judaioi</em>, you Jews!</p>
<p>How can you continually forget our father, the Father’s grace?!</p>
<p>Don’t you realize by now that all your stupid rituals, all your hard lessons learned, were a complete waste of time!? We Gentiles and God have moved on into the age of grace!</p>
<p>You Jews have forgotten the point of God’s grace, and so He’s practically forgotten you! We’re the firstborn, best-loved sons now. We’re the strong ones, and we outnumber you all at least three to one, so shut up and deal with it!</p>
<p>You’ve screwed up so often, you got kicked out of your land! And you didn’t learn any lessons then, because you got yourselves thrown out of Rome!</p>
<p>How could Nero have let you people back into this city? It’s shameful, really.</p>
<p>We never should have allowed you back into this Church, you…”</p></blockquote>
<p>[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]</p>
<p>Someone at the door.</p>
<p>The Roman Christians – Jew and Gentile alike – froze in fear.</p>
<p>Ethan looked at the other Gentile leaders.</p>
<p>Was it a centurion? Had their gathering been reported? Would they be asked to bow the knee, to offer a sacrifice, to the new emperor, Nero? If they weren’t willing to do so, would this be the end?</p>
<p>Jude glanced at his wife, their children, and the other Jewish families.</p>
<p>Had they already outstayed their recent welcome back to the city? After exile, they’d spent four hard, hard years rebuilding their life in Rome. Would they again be driven from their homes? Where would they go?</p>
<p>The slaves in the room – and there were many – anxiously retraced their steps throughout the day.</p>
<p>Which one of their fellow slaves had discovered their secret? Had followed them to this meeting? Had told their master? Would they merely get whipped again? Or had their master’s patience run out?</p>
<p>Jude whispered to Ethan, “You’re in charge here, get the door.”</p>
<p>He trudged to the threshold and pulled it open.</p>
<p>A hooded figure stepped through, walked to the middle of the room, and pulled the hood back. Long brown hair flowed down.</p>
<p>The woman said “Christ is Risen!”</p>
<p>“…He is…risen…indeed,” they all stammered in reply.</p>
<p>She smiled: “He is risen indeed. For twenty-five years now, in fact! Greetings. My name is Phoebe of Cenchreae.”</p>
<p>Rummaging in her pack, she began to explain:</p>
<p>“I bring something for all of you from Paul, the apostle… It’s in here, somewhere. No, not this theology textbook. No, not this to-do list… Ah! Here it is, a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>letter</strong></span>.”</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A homily on Mark 8:11-21 (ESV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.” And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. And he cautioned them, saying, “Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<blockquote>

Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.” And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.</p>

And he cautioned them, saying, “Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1974feb23-00025">In an interview, published in 1974</a>, with famed thinker Bertrand Russell, Leo Rosten asked Russell the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let us suppose, sir, that after you have left this sorry vale, you actually found yourself in heaven, standing before the Throne. There, in all his glory, sat the Lord—not Lord Russell, sir: God.”</p>
<p>Russell winced.</p>
<p>“What would you think?”</p>
<p>“I would think I was dreaming.”</p>
<p>“But suppose you realized you were not? Suppose that there, before your very eyes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, was God. What would you say?”</p>
<p>The pixie wrinkled his nose. “I probably would ask, ‘Sir, why did you not give me better evidence?’ “</p></blockquote>
<p>In Numbers 14:11, YHWH says to Moses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?”</p></blockquote>
<p>As we return to consider our passage from Mark 8, keep in mind that in the region of Tyre, Jesus has just performed a long-distance exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman’s daughter (7:24-30). He has just healed a deaf mute in the region of the Decapolis (7:31-37). He has just fed at least four thousand people with just seven loaves of bread in a desolate place (8:1-10).</p>
<p>And yet, in the region of Dalmanutha, the Pharisees have the audacity to <em><strong>demand a sign</strong></em> from heaven, to <strong>test</strong> Jesus in a manner not unlike the Adversary tested him in the wilderness (Mark 1:13).</p>
<p>Why does this demand exasperate Jesus? Surely, given his recent actions, he is not averse to the supernatural in-breaking of God’s kingdom as demonstrated in his miracles. Instead, he astutely recognizes <strong>the incompatibility of this sign-seeking pharisaical power-play with true trust, true faith.</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.catholiccommentaryonsacredscripture.com/volumes-authors/mary-healy/">Catholic scholar Mary Healy </a>rightfully observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“to insist on irrefutable evidence is really a demand for control, as if to say ‘Force us to believe, so that we will not have to trust you or change our hearts.’ But faith that is compelled is not faith at all” (<em>The Gospel of Mark</em>, 153).</p></blockquote>
<p>I am here reminded of the twin-error of fundamentalism and liberalism when it comes to biblical and theological studies: the insistence that <strong>we will only believe what is scientifically verifiable according to the standards we have inherited from Enlightenment Rationalism</strong>. The former group thinks <strong>everything</strong> can be verified, the latter group, very <strong>little</strong>.</p>
<p>Sure, OK, but <u>we’re</u> not fundamentalists or liberals, at least not on our <em>good</em> days. But, following the example of the disciples in the second half of our passage, <em>don’t we often pine for various other kinds of bread while we misunderstand and ignore the true bread of heaven among us</em>?</p>
<p>Will we be satisfied by God’s faithful provision of Word and Sacrament to nourish our faith? Or will we long for the more extraordinary manifestations? (As if Word &amp; Sacrament were ordinary!)</p>
<p>Now, can we, should we long for miracles, for healing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can God, will God continue to work wonders, heal sickness, and reverse death in our midst?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But we must be constantly <em><strong>vigilant</strong></em>, first, that we do not begin to value the healing more than the Healer, the wonders more than the One who works them.</p>
<p>And, second, that we do not, like the Pharisees (and even the disciples, for a time!), close our eyes, ears, and hearts to the miraculous things that God, in Christ, is <em><strong>already</strong></em> and <em><strong>always</strong></em> doing.</p>
<p>Whether we can discern it or not, <strong>God is making the world right again. He will not be thwarted in this mission</strong>.</p>
<p>Friends, God knows that we need some sort of sign, that we cannot keep the faith on our own, unaided. So he has given us sign-seekers His very self, His very Son!</p>
<p>He will not bow down to our demands for <em>verification</em>, but he will graciously meet our every need. He will give us enough to trust him along the road to cosmic redemption, even when that road passes through the deepest, darkest valley of doubt.</p>
<p>So, as we rightfully pray that God’s Kingdom would come, that His will might be done, let us pray to be satisfied in our King, in God’s Son.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A homily on Mark 1:29-45 (ESV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-29&#34;&gt;And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-30&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24242&#34;&gt;Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-31&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24243&#34;&gt;And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-32&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24244&#34;&gt;That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-33&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24245&#34;&gt;And the whole city was gathered together at the door.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-1-34&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24246&#34;&gt;And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homily on Mark 1:29-45 (ESV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Mark-1-29">And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-30" id="en-ESV-24242">Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-31" id="en-ESV-24243">And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Mark-1-32" id="en-ESV-24244">That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-33" id="en-ESV-24245">And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-34" id="en-ESV-24246">And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Mark-1-35">And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-36" id="en-ESV-24248">And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,</span> <span class="text Mark-1-37" id="en-ESV-24249">and they found him and said to him,“Everyone is looking for you.”</span> <span class="text Mark-1-38" id="en-ESV-24250">And he said to them, <span class="woj">“Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.”</span></span> <span class="text Mark-1-39" id="en-ESV-24251">And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="text Mark-1-40">And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, “If you will, you can make me clean.”</span> <span class="text Mark-1-41" id="en-ESV-24253">Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, <span class="woj">“I will; be clean.”</span></span> <span class="text Mark-1-42" id="en-ESV-24254">And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="text Mark-1-43" id="en-ESV-24255">And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once,</span> <span class="text Mark-1-44" id="en-ESV-24256">and said to him, <span class="woj">“See that you say nothing to anyone, but go,show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.”</span></span> <span class="text Mark-1-45" id="en-ESV-24257">But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Today’s Gospel lesson consists of at least three distinct episodes.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Mark 1:29-34, Jesus heals Peter’s mother-in-law before a night-long, town-wide round of healings and exorcisms.</li>
<li>Then, in Mark 1:35-39, Jesus absconds to a desolate place in the early morning hours to pray. When Peter and the others find him, he reaffirms the preaching focus of his ministry, before taking the disciples along with him as he proclaims the kingdom in Galilee, and demonstrates the kingdom by casting out demons.</li>
<li>Finally, in Mark 1:40-45, a leper courageously and somewhat scandalously approaches Jesus, asking to be made clean. Jesus, moved with compassion, grants his request, makes him clean, charges him with silence, and – partially because the request for silence went unheeded – is forced to remain in desolate places to avoid the growing attention his ministry is receiving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, what to make of these things? As ministers within the Church, as followers of Jesus, I think we naturally (and rightly) tend to place ourselves in the place of Christ’s <em><strong>disciples</strong></em> when we work our way through Gospel texts.</p>
<p>However, with today’s episodes, I’d like us to consider what we can learn about our vocations from <strong>Peter’s mother-in-law</strong>, from <strong>Jesus himself</strong>, and from the <strong>leper</strong>. These, I believe, demonstrate the importance of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">service</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">prayer</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">proclamation</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">worship</span></p>
<p>First, as with several of Jesus’ miraculous healings, Peter’s mother-in-law is raised from her bed as a <em>foreshadowing of Christ’s resurrection</em>. And although the use of the verb <em>diakoneo</em> to mean “to serve, to wait upon,” is perfectly within the term’s semantic range, we should not fail to notice that the woman provides an apt example of the Christian life: just as she was raised from her bed and began to serve Christ and the disciples, we are raised from our sickness of Sin and Death for a purpose, unto a life of <em><strong>service</strong></em> within Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>Secondly, after an eventful night of healings and casting out demons, Jesus demonstrates for us the sustaining importance of <em><strong>prayer</strong></em>, even and especially in the lives of ministry big shots, by retreating to a deserted place in the early morning hours to pray to the Father. This lifestyle of prayer is what sustains his healing ministry, and also, thirdly, it sustains his <em><strong>preaching</strong></em> ministry.</p>
<p>Jesus does not lose focus in the midst of growing crowds. He takes time to be alone, to pray – and he relentlessly proclaims the coming Kingdom of God to the people. May we strike the same balance as our Lord in our ministries today.</p>
<p>Service. Prayer. Proclamation. And finally, <em><strong>Worship</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Notice the leper, condemned to a life of painful illness and perhaps even more painful social exclusion. Taking the risk that Jesus might recoil in horror at his presence, like countless others would have, the leper boldly asks, notice, not primarily for physical healing, but for <em>restoration to the worshiping community</em>!</p>
<p>We must keep the biblical, and not the clinical, meaning of “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">clean</span>” in mind here: <em><strong>acceptable and ready to worship the living God</strong></em>! Jesus reverses the normal contagion movement, transferring his cleanliness to the unclean man, restoring the leper to a life of worship. A beautiful exchange, one which Christ is still willing to make with us today! <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>However, are we as eager as the leper to be healed in order to worship God? To serve God? To pray to God? To proclaim God’s Kingdom?</strong></span></p>
<p>Let us not make healing a <em>self-centered</em> occurrence. Christ offers us healing and restoration for this fourfold purpose: <strong>service</strong>, <strong>prayer</strong>, <strong>proclamation</strong>, and <strong>worship</strong>.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A homily on James 2.1-13 (ESV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-1&#34;&gt;“My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,the Lord of glory.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-2&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30279&#34;&gt;For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-3&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30280&#34;&gt;and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-4&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30281&#34;&gt;have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-5&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30282&#34;&gt;Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-6&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30283&#34;&gt;But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-7&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30284&#34;&gt;Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homily on James 2.1-13 (ESV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Jas-2-1">“My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,the Lord of glory.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-2" id="en-ESV-30279">For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,</span> <span class="text Jas-2-3" id="en-ESV-30280">and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”</span> <span class="text Jas-2-4" id="en-ESV-30281">have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-5" id="en-ESV-30282">Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-6" id="en-ESV-30283">But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-7" id="en-ESV-30284">Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?</span></p>
<p><span class="text Jas-2-8" id="en-ESV-30285">“If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-9" id="en-ESV-30286">But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-10" id="en-ESV-30287">For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.</span><span class="text Jas-2-11" id="en-ESV-30288">For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-12" id="en-ESV-30289">So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-13" id="en-ESV-30290">For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The verse immediately preceding this morning’s lesson, James 1:27, says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em><strong>religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world</strong></em>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">purity from the world</span></em> on one hand, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>social justice for the oppressed</em></span> on the other. And yet, in a world which is stained by rampant injustice, <strong>these are not two different pursuits, but different facets of the same agenda</strong>. Just as we must not allow the manifold sins of the world to stain our souls, we must take care to not allow the deathly and selfish perspectives of the world to stain our vision!</p>
<p>The world says that this [slaps Bible] is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just a book</span>. We <strong>disagree</strong>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The world says that this [slaps altar] is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just a table</span>. Just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bread</span>. Just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">wine</span>. We <strong>disagree</strong>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>.</p>
<p>This [gestures to room] is <strong>more</strong> than mere <span style="text-decoration:underline;">meditation</span>. Our God is <strong>more</strong> than a divinized <span style="text-decoration:underline;">delusion</span>.</p>
<p><strong>We have wiped the world’s mud out of our eyes, to see more clearly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Very good!</strong></p>
<p>The world says that a poor, homeless, drug-addled woman is a broken human being. We <strong>agree</strong>.</p>
<p>The world says that a rich, well-dressed, influential man is a less-broken human being, or at least broken in a more comfortable way.</p>
<p>We <strong>agree</strong>. Or at least we’re constantly tempted to in the everyday moments of our lives! Sure, theoretically, in the midst of a homily perhaps, we’d give the right answer. But practically, brothers and sisters, we’re <em><strong>partial</strong></em>. Our vision is still <em><strong>stained</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We’ve been wooed by the world’s wisdom.</p>
<p>We allow the stratified contents and contours of the world <span style="text-decoration:underline;">around</span> us to dictate the distinctions <span style="text-decoration:underline;">among</span> us.</p>
<p>We make evil judgments – very subtle, to be sure, but just so, that much more evil judgments! – based on the way things <em><u>are</u></em>.</p>
<p>We are naïve newcomers to the law of liberty – to the law which gives freedom <em><strong>from</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are</span>, <em><strong>from</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">have been</span> as long as we can remember, and freedom <em><strong>for</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">once were</span>, in a garden unstained by Sin and Death. A freedom <em><strong>for</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ought to be</span>, and will be in a city illuminated by Christ himself.</p>
<p>Christ himself, the One of whom Isaiah spoke thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear, but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth</span>; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins”</strong></em> (Isaiah 11:1-5).</p></blockquote>
<p>Friends, the rich are not inherently evil because of their possessions. We know this. They, <strong>we</strong>, have their own pains and problems, which we will need to address thoughtfully as a church providentially located in one of the world’s most affluent communities – and <strong>this is no easy task</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>But</strong></em></span> it would be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">easy</span> for us to allow the stratified realities around us to stain our vision, to keep us short-sighted, to keep us complacent that <strong>it would be just as unusual for the homeless and shabbily-clothed to join <span style="text-decoration:underline;">our</span> community</strong> (really <span style="text-decoration:underline;">join</span> us, not just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">visit</span>), <strong>as it would be for the rich and well-dressed to have joined the earliest Christians, or many of our impoverished brothers and sisters around the world today</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us fight hard against this subtle temptation.</p>
<p>Let us consider how we should best love and welcome those the world <span style="text-decoration:underline;">calls</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">treats</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sees</span> as “<em><strong>the least</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Let us <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>disagree</strong></span>! And <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>!</p>
<p>Let us treat them as “<em><strong>the loved</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<p>—</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The “hometown,” “home court” advantage is a very real occurrence in many areas of life. Familiar fans and supportive surroundings help us humans to perform better at many tasks, from singing to sports.</p>
<p><em><strong>But not in sermons.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is very seldom a home court advantage in preaching!</p>
<p>Family and close friends may inspire us to make the game-winning shot, or hit the highest note, but when it comes to the intimate affair of preaching God’s Word — of transcending the divide between <em>there &amp; then</em> and <em>here &amp; now</em>, making it clear how the words of Scripture should enlighten, encourage, confront, and challenge us — when it comes to preaching to family and friends, it’s <em><strong>hard</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Granted, it might be easier to impress, to invigorate, to lay on the rhetorical relish with grandiose gestures, dazzling diction, and absolutely awesome alliteration.</p>
<p>But that’s not preaching. That’s a <em><strong>show</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Preaching takes guts… It takes bravery to do the necessary hard work at the intersection between the stuff of God and the stuff of life.</p>
<p>Because, <strong>if what we Christians believe is TRUE, everything changes</strong>, and a preacher’s job is to make that clear.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to family and friends, it’s difficult to preach repentance to those who changed your diapers, calmed your tantrums, kept your secrets.</p>
<p>But every stressed out seminarian, every nervous young pastor preparing to preach to the home crowd, can take heart that the very One we preach, Jesus the Messiah, faced a similar challenge during his earthly preaching ministry.</p>
<h2 id="mark-1-5">Mark 1-5</h2>
<p>Please turn with me to the Gospel of Mark, beginning on page 836 of your pew Bibles.</p>
<p>To understand today’s Gospel text from Mark 6, we first need a bit of context from Mark chapters 1 through 5. Please follow along with me in your Bibles, glancing at the pages as I summarize these chapters.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I’d like us to note is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>Jesus is on a roll</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>Mark’s Gospel takes off quickly into the narrative of Jesus, who, after he is baptized by his forerunner John, is affirmed of his identity by the very voice of God. He is then driven yet sustained by the Spirit through the wilderness testings of Satan.</p>
<p>Jesus then returns from the wilderness and begins his preaching ministry in Galilee — boldly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.&rsquo;” (1:15)</p></blockquote>
<p>He then calls his first disciples, who join him in his whirlwind ministry of preaching and teaching with authority, healing the sick, and casting out demons. So much for chapter 1!</p>
<p>In chapter 2, he challenges Jewish conceptions about the forgiveness of sins, fasting, and keeping Sabbath.</p>
<p>In chapter 3, we witness the first hints of outright opposition to Jesus on account of his unorthodox Sabbath practices, yet this is immediately followed by a description of Jesus’ growing crowd of followers.</p>
<p>Unfazed, Jesus calls and appoints the twelve apostles. He challenges the experts in Jewish Law, and scandalously stretches the boundaries of family.</p>
<p>In chapter 4, he teaches in parables, before commanding and calming the wind and the sea.</p>
<p>In chapter 5, he upsets an entire region by casting out a legion of demons. And before we get to chapter 6, he reverses death itself for the sake of a synagogue official, and reverses disease for the sake of a woman with a discharge of blood.</p>
<p><strong>In the face of FAITH,Jesus tells the dead to get up. He calls the physically, financially, and relationally destitute one “daughter.”</strong></p>
<p>Jesus is on a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>roll</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Jesus is up to something <strong>BIG</strong>, something <strong>NEW</strong>. He is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>bringing in the very kingdom of God</strong></span>, unexpectedly centered around HIMSELF, and NOTHING, NO ONE –</p>
<ul>
<li>not winds,</li>
<li>not waves,</li>
<li>not Pharisees,</li>
<li>not scribes,</li>
<li>not disease,</li>
<li>not destitution,</li>
<li>not demons,</li>
<li>not even DEATH – can stand in his way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, maybe <em><strong>one</strong></em> thing can.</p>
<h2 id="our-text-mark-61-13">Our Text: Mark 6:1-13</h2>
<p>We’re now on page 841, Mark chapter 6 begins this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He [Jesus] went away from there and came to his hometown [Nazareth], and his disciples followed him.</p>
<p>And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?”</p>
<p>And they took offense at him.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, before I get to two negative aspects of the Nazarenes’ reaction, let’s consider two positives:</p>
<h3 id="first-in-verse-2-they-are-asking-the-right-questions">First, in verse 2, they are <strong>asking the right questions</strong>.</h3>
<p>They recognize that Jesus has wisdom, mighty works, mighty hands – things which should have reminded them of God himself:</p>
<p>The God who, according to Jeremiah (51:15),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“made the earth by his <strong>power</strong>, who established the world by his <strong>wisdom</strong>, and by his <strong>understanding</strong> stretched out the heavens.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The God who, according to Deuteronomy (4:34 and 7:19), rescued Israel from the house of slavery with a “<strong>mighty hand</strong> and an outstretched arm.”</p>
<p><strong>Jesus’ wisdom and mighty deeds should have persuaded them that God was up to something big, something new</strong>.</p>
<p>The Creator was <strong>re-creating</strong>. The Redeemer was <strong>rescuing</strong> and <strong>restoring</strong> — like Jesus had just done with Jairus’ daughter and the bleeding woman in chapter 5.</p>
<h3 id="second-in-verse-3-everything-the-hometown-crowd-says-is-factually-correct">Second, in verse 3, <strong>everything the hometown crowd says is factually correct!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Jesus was <em>in fact</em> a carpenter by family trade.</li>
<li>And although it’s perhaps a slur, or a reference to Joseph’s prior death, Jesus is <em>in fact</em> the “Son of Mary.”</li>
<li>He did <em>in fact</em> have siblings.</li>
<li>He was <em>in fact</em> from Nazareth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what’s wrong with the hometown reaction? Let me focus on two things:</p>
<h3 id="first-their-reaction-shows-us-that-you-can-ask-the-right-questions-with-the-wrong-attitude">First, their reaction shows us that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>you can ask the right questions with the wrong attitude</strong></span>.</h3>
<p>Sure, Jesus’ wisdom and mighty deeds should have persuaded them that God was up to something big, something new – and that they might have to change their lives because of it.</p>
<p>But instead, they ask their questions with incredulous skepticism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just who does Jesus think he is?</p>
<p>What right has he to say these things? To act this way?</p>
<p>We know who he really is. We watched him grow up!</p>
<p>He’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>just one of us</strong></em></span>, a normal Nazarene.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="second-then-their-reaction-shows-us-that-you-can-know-the-facts-and-miss-the-point">Second, then, their reaction shows us that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>you can know the facts and miss the point</strong></span>.</h3>
<p>In fact, sometimes, you can use the facts in order to miss the point!</p>
<p>You can miss Truth with a capital “T” by focusing on the lowercase.</p>
<p>That’s what they’re doing here. The scandalized hometown crowd is bringing up the familiar, comfortable aspects of Jesus’ existence to give themselves a way out from underneath Jesus’ powerful claims on them and their future.</p>
<p>After all, they don’t have to repent in light of the coming Kingdom of God if this “King Jesus,” what with his preaching and working wonders like some kind of prophet, is really just the homeboy handyman who’s out of his mind, right?</p>
<p>So, Jesus responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.”</p>
<p>And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Citing a familiar proverb of the day — something close to “familiarity breeds contempt” – Jesus steps into a long tradition of rejected prophets — those sent by Yahweh to diagnose the sins of his people and point them back to covenant loyalty, but repeatedly rejected because of their intensely unpopular proclamations.</p>
<p>Hear the haunting words of 2 Chronicles 36(:15-16). Commenting upon the faithlessness of Judah, it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.</p>
<p>But they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose against his people, until there was no remedy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>(…speaking there of the Babylon exile)</p>
<p>Friends, <strong>Jesus is the remedy! He is Yahweh’s true Prophet! He brings us back from exile. He is the King in the Kingdom of God, with dominion over demons, disease, and death!</strong></p>
<p>And yet, in the face of stubborn unbelief at Nazareth, Mark is willing to say that Jesus was <em><strong>UNABLE</strong></em> to so a mighty work there.</p>
<p>Sure, he healed a few sick people, but <strong>whereas elsewhere in the Gospels it is the crowds who marvel at the mighty words and works of Jesus, here he himself is STUNNED by their unbelief!</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Sisters, brothers: <strong>You can know the facts, and miss the point. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Because FACTS aren’t FAITH.</span></strong></p>
<p>FAITH is not merely intellectual assent to true propositions about Jesus. Look back at Mark 5, to Jairus and the bleeding woman!</p>
<h4 id="faith-is-about-entrusting-yourself-your-entire-life-to-jesus-as-your-king--your-only-hope-your-only-lord"><strong>Faith is about entrusting yourself, your entire life, to Jesus as your King – your only Hope, your only Lord.</strong></h4>
<p>When you hear “<strong>faith</strong>,” think “<em>faithfulness</em>.” Think “<em>trust</em>.” Think “<em>loyalty</em>.”</p>
<p>Faith is something absolutely necessary for a relationship to exist. This is true with humans, and it’s true with God.</p>
<p>Knowing the right things, having the Creed memorized backwards and front, is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> the same as <strong>life-changing loyalty to Jesus Christ</strong>.</p>
<p>And, to be sure, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">faith cannot merely be produced by sheer force of will</span>. We would be nothing but <em>faithless</em> were it not for God’s <strong>grace</strong>.</p>
<p>But faith does involve our <strong>wills</strong>, our entire <strong>selves</strong>. It is something we <strong>commit</strong> to. It is something that, by God’s grace, we <strong>participate</strong> in.</p>
<p>And it is something that can be <em><strong>rejected</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Now, there are some in the world who would be perfectly comfortable to come right out say “<em>I reject and refuse Jesus as Lord.</em>” Unbelief can take the form of outright opposition to Jesus. In the Gospels, we see this in those who want Jesus dead.</p>
<p>But that’s not the rejection Jesus receives here at Nazareth. And, my guess is, that’s not the refusal he receives from me, from you, either.</p>
<p>Because, see, <strong>we’re prone to the subtler (and therefore greater) rejection of Jesus by making him to “just one of us.”</strong></p>
<p>Now, don’t misunderstand me. <strong>Jesus was and is fully human</strong>. He doesn’t save us from a distance. He dove from heaven’s heights into the muck and mire of our sin-stained existence to bring us back to God.</p>
<p>But this salvation involves <strong>repentance</strong>. It requires turning away from our faithless pursuit of Sin and Death. And it requires the faithfulness of turning toward our faithful God.</p>
<p>Salvation does not require us getting back to God on our own efforts or merit, but it does entail <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>complete and utter dependence on and allegiance to Jesus as King</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>But, as we’ve seen, we can <span style="text-decoration:underline;">escape</span> total allegiance to King Jesus if he’s “<em><strong>just one of us Nazarenes</strong></em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Friends, King Jesus is not “<em>just one of us</em>“!</strong></p>
<p>He has his own agenda of cosmic redemption. He has his own approach, which often appears upside-down to us, because it involves repentance and self-sacrifice, because it includes suffering on a bloodstained Cross before the triumph of the Empty Tomb.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>King Jesus is not “<em>just one of us</em>“!</strong></span></p>
<h4 id="so-the-uncomfortable-question-stands-are-we-loyal-to-king-jesus-above-all-else-or-are-we-loyal-to-a-jesus-weve-made-in-our-own-image">So the uncomfortable question stands: Are we loyal to King Jesus above all else? Or are we loyal to a “<em>Jesus</em>” we’ve made <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in our own image</span>?</h4>
<p>King Jesus is not “<em><strong>middle-to-upper-class-American-Jesus</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, he cares about the welfare of those around the world and those in this country more than we do. His agenda surely has implications for life here in the United States of America, and it very well might require the hard work of being faithful with many resources and possessions.</p>
<p>But, hear me:</p>
<h4 id="king-jesus-doesnt-just-want-to-add-a-pearly-gate-to-our-picket-fences-he-doesnt-just-want-to-stamp-a-jesus-approved-ticket-to-heaven-on-our-pre-existent-american-dream">King Jesus doesn’t just want to add a pearly gate to our picket fences. He doesn’t just want to stamp a Jesus-approved ticket to heaven on our pre-existent American Dream.</h4>
<h4 id="he-wants-us-to-crucify-the-american-dream">He wants us to crucify the American Dream!</h4>
<h4 id="he-calls-us-to-abandon-our-self-centered-agendas-of-upward-mobility-and-instead-to-take-up-our-crosses-to-adopt-his-others-focused-agenda-of-self-sacrificial-love">He calls us to abandon our self-centered agendas of upward mobility, and instead to take up our crosses! To adopt his others-focused agenda of self-sacrificial love!</h4>
<p>And just like it was for Jesus’ hometown crowd back then, our easiest way out of this required repentance now is <strong>to make Jesus’ message a little less demanding and his mission a little bit more like our own</strong>, <em><strong>until finally, faithlessly – though we may worship Jesus with our lips – in our hearts, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">we worship only ourselves</span>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Briefly notice with me that, in Mark 6:7-13, Jesus sends out his disciples to do what he himself had been doing: preaching repentance, casting out demons, and healing the sick.</p>
<h4 id="king-jesus-followers-carry-forward-his-mission-do-we">King Jesus’ followers carry forward his mission. Do we?</h4>
<h4 id="will-we-in-faith-entrust-our-entire-lives-in-allegiance-to-him-no-matter-the-changes-no-matter-the-costs">Will we, in faith, entrust our entire lives in allegiance to him? No matter the changes? No matter the costs?</h4>
<h4 id="will-we-refuse-to-make-jesus-into-just-one-of-us">Will we refuse to make Jesus into “just one of us”?</h4>
<h4 id="king-jesus-has-dominion-over-disease-demons-and-death-does-he-have-dominion-over-our-dreams-and-desires">King Jesus has dominion over disease, demons, and death. Does he have dominion over our dreams and desires?</h4>
<p>By God’s grace — given to us in the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ our Lord — By God’s amazing grace, <strong>may these things be so, may we follow him <span style="text-decoration:underline;">faithfully</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<p><a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/12-28-14JoshSteeleHolyInnocents.mp3">Today is December 28</a> (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents">The Slaughter of the Innocents</a>,” the killing of the baby boys of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> by King <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great">Herod</a>.</p>
<p>The Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07419a.htm">to at least the fifth century</a>. In the fourth century, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatius">Chromatius</a> described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf.

<p>What if we knew the names of the victims of Herod’s infamous, paranoid rage?</p>
<p>What if the cries of Bethlehem took place today in Birmingham?</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED (NAMES OF BOYS IN CHURCH AGED TWO AND UNDER)]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED]</p>

<p>May it never, ever be.</p>
<p>But what if such a tragedy took place inside our community?</p>
<p>Bright young lives, cut short by darkness.A deafening silence replaces the cries of the young.The tears of the parents a lingering reminder of the tears of their lost children.</p>
<p>May it never, ever be.</p>
<p>But it has been… and it frequently is… true.The small and the young are slaughtered by the big and supposedly powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hebrew babies, by Pharaoh.</li>
<li>Bethlehem’s young, by Herod.</li>
<li>Babies not yet born, by their parents.</li>
<li>Babies already born, by their parents.</li>
<li>Sandy Hook Elementary students, by Adam Lanza.</li>
<li>Students in Peshawar, by the Pakistani Taliban.</li>
<li>Pakistani children, by U.S. drone strikes.</li>
<li>Central American children, by gangs and drug lords…</li>
</ul>
<p>May it never, ever be?</p>
<p>Lord , have mercy! Lord Jesus, come quickly! For these things so often ARE.</p>
<p>You do not have to look far to spot evil.You do not have to look much further to spot violence that victimizes children.</p>
<p>This is not an ancient Egyptian or Judean issue,it is an issue for today – an issue for eternity.If it is not happening today in our community,it IS happening right now in some community.</p>
<p>Consider this, today, as we commemorate the “Holy Innocents” of Bethlehem– nameless to us,but called by name by both their parents and their God.</p>
<p>Consider this, today, as we contemplate <strong>how the Incarnation unveils both the source of and the desperate need for hope</strong>…the brilliant light of Christ against the dark backdrop of intense evil and incomprehensible suffering.</p>
<p>Let us pray…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O ALMIGHTY God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by their deaths: Mortify and kill all vices in us, and so strengthen us by thy grace, that by the innocency of our lives, and constancy of our faith even unto death, we may glorify thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve said that the Incarnation unveils both the source of and the desperate need for hope.Let us consider both together as we turn to <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearABC/HolyDays/HolyInno.html#GOSPEL">today’s Gospel text, Matthew 2:13–18</a>.</p>
<p>The structure of this passage is easy enough to ascertain.</p>
<ul>
<li>It begins, in vv. 13-15, by depicting the flight of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus from Bethlehem to Egypt – concluding in v. 15 with a quotation from Hosea 11:1.</li>
<li>Then, in vv. 16-18, we witness the grisly scene at Bethlehem, which is then linked by Matthew to a quotation from Jeremiah 31:15.</li>
<li>Although this sermon will only address these 6 verses, vv.19-23 complete the symmetry of these events by depicting the return of the family from Egypt to Nazareth in Galilee.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, then:</p>
<h2 id="i-in-telling-of-the-flight-to-egyptvv-13-15-portray-jesus-as-the-new-moses-the-true-israeland-the-source-of-hope">I. IN TELLING OF THE FLIGHT TO EGYPT,VV. 13-15 PORTRAY JESUS AS THE NEW MOSES, THE TRUE ISRAEL,AND THE SOURCE OF HOPE.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”</p>
<p>And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod.</p>
<p>This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet,</p>
<p>“Out of Egypt I called my son.”</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="a-the-flight">A. THE FLIGHT</h3>
<p>Verse 13 begins by referring to the departure of the wise men, after offering their now-famous gifts. And just as they were warned in a dream to take an alternate route home to avoid Herod, so Joseph is commanded in a dream by a messenger of the Lord to flee to Egypt to avoid Herod.</p>
<p>Herod the Great’s attempts to destroy the Christ-child here echo the much earlier attempts of Pharaoh to kill Moses in the book of Exodus – first, generally and unwittingly, by ordering all Hebrew baby boys to be cast into the Nile (Exod. 1:22); and then, even more specifically, when Pharaoh tried to kill Moses after Moses’ had murdered a nameless Egyptian (Exod. 2:15). In this way, Matthew links Herod with Pharaoh, and Jesus with Moses.</p>
<p>Therefore , although Egypt was, in the immediate sense, a natural destination to escape Herod’s jurisdiction, Matthew is drawing deeper connections. Egypt was the house of slavery from which the nation of Israel was redeemed. It is significant, then, that the Son of God goes there as a refugee before returning to the land of Israel to redeem the world.</p>
<p>The urgency of the angel’s command matches the urgency with which it was obeyed. The family made the approximately 90 mile journey, beginning under cover of darkness. And they obediently remained there u<br>
ntil receiving further instructions – until Herod would later die, allowing them to return and to journey to Nazareth in Galilee.</p>
<h3 id="b-the-fulfillment">B. THE FULFILLMENT</h3>
<p>And then Matthew says that these things happened in order that that which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet – in this case, the prophet Hosea – might be fulfilled: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” As I have mentioned, this comes from Hosea 11, from a beautiful prophetic passage which begins by speaking of Israel and the Exodus – the formative event in the birth of the young nation, the young “son” of God.</p>
<p>This way of speaking about Israel as God’s son comes from the book of Exodus itself, when Moses is told to tell Pharaoh ***“Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son,*<em><strong>and I say to you ‘Let my son go that he may serve me” (4:22–23a).</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a metaphorical use of the word “son” to refer to the relationship between Yahweh and his people. However, as the Exodus passage continues, if Pharaoh refused to let Yahweh’s metaphorical firstborn son go, Yahweh would kill Pharaoh’s literal firstborn son.</p>
<p>Literal and metaphorical sonship collide in the person of Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God who fully shares the divine nature of his Father, and he is also the Son of God who fulfills the calling and the destiny of the nation of Israel.Here his sojourn in Egypt fulfills the Exodus. Later, in Matthew 4, his wilderness temptation fulfills the Old Testament wilderness wanderings.Jesus is not just the New Moses. He is the True Israel.</p>
<p>Only when divine sonship is seen as an important biblical theme does this Hosea quotation make sense. Matthew is not proof-texting here, because in the Hosea passage, the “son” immediately turns away from Yahweh to idolatry in the very next verse!Instead , Matthew is claiming that the link Hosea made between the people of Israel and God’s “son” finds its fullest meaning – it is fulfilled and completed – in the person of Jesus.</p>
<p>Already , early in Matthew’s Gospel, we get the sense that Christ is going to change things, He’s going to complete God’s mission of setting the world right again.</p>
<p>I wish I could end there. However,</p>
<h2 id="ii-in-telling-of-the-slaughter-of-the-innocentsvv-16-18-reveal-the-desperate-need-for-hope"><strong>II. IN TELLING OF THE SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS,VV. 16-18 REVEAL THE DESPERATE NEED FOR HOPE.</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.</p>
<p>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</p>
<p>“A voice was heard in Ramah,</p>
<p>weeping and loud lamentation,</p>
<p>Rachel weeping for her children;</p>
<p>she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="a-the-massacre"><strong>A. THE MASSACRE</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents#cite_note-17">estimates</a>, the number of baby boys killed in the region of Bethlehem would have been between 10 and 30.In the course of the Church’s commemoration of this event, the number has grown drastically – to 14,000; 64,000; or even 144,000.</p>
<p>Of course , some have gone to the opposite extreme and claimed that this event never actually happened.Matthew must have been making this story up to draw the connections between Jesus and Moses. He had the Old Testament texts and made a story to match.</p>
<p><strong>That’s one way around this difficult text,but I think it’s a cop-out.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew quotes Jeremiah 31:15 and therefore creates a link in reverse to the Old Testament passage. However, in a certain sense, this link only works in one direction. That is, if one only had Jeremiah 31:15, it is obviously not a straightforward prophecy of a bloodthirsty ruler killing babies.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew is using the Old Testament to make some sense of this senseless slaughter, not to create it.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore , this massacre at Bethlehem fits quite well with the historical portrait we have of Herod – especially in his later years. Herod was crazy. If he thought you were a threat to his power, goodbye! The man even killed three of his own sons.</p>
<p>It is therefore not altogether surprising that, as terrible as it was, the deaths of a dozen or so babies in the hill town of Bethlehem would not have made it into the secular history books of that violent period.</p>
<p>I still think it happened.</p>
<p>Does that make you feel any better?</p>
<p>Perhaps a victory for the historical reliability of the Gospel accounts, but at what cost?</p>
<p>We’re still left with bereaved mothers and bloodstained cribs.</p>
<p>I don’t feel any better.</p>
<p>Although I’m sure I’ll find this passage even more poignant when, Lord-willing, I am a parent myself someday,some of its true weight hit me for the first time when, after reading the passage together, my wife (a pediatric nurse) started to tear-up and, after a long silence, said: “<em><strong>I don’t understand why those children had to die for Jesus to come… If I’m honest, it makes me angry</strong></em>.”</p>
<p><u>She has a point, right?</u> If God could save Jesus from bloodthirsty Herod, why not the Bethlehem babies? Didn’t the angel of the Lord have enough free time to show up in the dreams of the other Bethlehem parents? Doesn’t this event, like all the others I mentioned in my introduction, rightly prompt the question, perhaps asked with a tone of weeping and loud lamentation: <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”?</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="b-the-fulfillment-1"><strong>B. THE FULFILLMENT</strong></h3>
<p>This passage sticks with me partially because my wife’s name is Rachel. She has wept, as a nurse, over the often senseless suffering of her patients. And she is not alone. Matthew draws our attention to Jeremiah 31:15, depicting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel">Rachel</a> – the wife of Jacob, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin – as weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are no more. <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”</strong></em></p>
<p>The original context of this passage is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity">the Babylonian invasion and exile</a> of the people of Judah. Ramah, just 5 miles north of Jerusalem, was where the exiles were assembled in 586 B.C. for the journey into Babylon.</p>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah witnessed Jerusalem destroyed and its inhabitants terrorized. He poetically depicts Rachel, the Old Testament’s paradigmatic and idealized mother of the people of Israel, as weeping for her children as they go into exile.</p>
<p>Imagine Eve, the mother of the living, weeping as she looks forward from the past to see all the horrible effects of the exile from Eden, and you’ll get a similar idea.</p>
<p><img alt="Mary Consoles Eve; Crayon and pencil by Sr. Grace Remington, OCSO. Copyright 2005, Sisters of the Mississippi Abbey" loading="lazy" src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/3db50ce023b508bf504989eb63cade85/tumblr_nudb6u53As1qfvq9bo1_r1_1280.jpg"></p>
<p>The connection is HOPE.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 31:15, although tragic, occurs in a hopeful section of the book. In fact, the chapter of Jeremiah 31 is best known for its depiction in vv.31–40 of the New Covenant! The quoted verse about Rachel weeping is followed by these two verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus says the Lord:</p>
<p>“ Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work, declares the Lord, and they shall come back from the land of the enemy.</p>
<p>There is hope for your future, declares the Lord, and your children shall come back to their own country.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rachel was weeping over the exile.And she is promised that it will one day end.The exiles will return – as they began to do,48 years later, in 538 BC.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that <u>this “prophecy” did not somehow cause the tragedy at Bethlehem</u>.As John Calvin notes in his Gospel commentary, because Jeremiah’s oracle had its own fulfillment regarding the exile to Babylon and the subsequent return, “Matthew does not mean that it foretold what Herod would do, but that the coming of Christ occasioned a renewal of that mourning, which had been experienced, many centuries before,” by the people of Israel.</p>
<p>Because , you’ll notice, <strong>the people of Israel were still in exile</strong>. Sure, five centuries had passed since they had physically returned, but they still lived under a foreign ruler, not a son of David, who could enter the city of David at will and have the baby boys slaughtered.</p>
<p><strong>We have an encounter between two kings in this passage</strong>. The first, a crazed old man, is the illegitimate king of the Jews – deathly afraid of pretenders to his throne. The second, a vulnerable human baby, is the legitimate king of the Jews and of the world.</p>
<p>When faced with the latter, the former should have bowed the knee – as did the wise men (who, you’ll notice, came from the exile-lands of Babylon and Persia). Instead, Herod draws the sword, and the Son of God goes into exile, a refugee in the ancient land of slavery from which his people were bought and delivered by Yahweh.</p>
<p>With the mothers of Bethlehem, Rachel was still weeping.</p>
<p>Her children were not yet home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>
<p>What do we make of this?</p>
<p>Although the Jeremiah quotation points in the direction of hope, you’ll notice that Matthew leaves it hanging on a note of lamentation.</p>
<p>Might I suggest that <strong><u>the yearly Feast of the Holy Innocents is our liturgical antidote to a merely superficial and sentimental Christmas season</u></strong>?</p>
<p>The realities of Bethlehem, of the Christian faith, and of our lives, often have more blood, sweat, and tears in them than we care to admit – more pain than our idyllic notions can contain.</p>
<p>The Incarnation is glorious, but it’s also <u>messy</u>. Because we are messy! The human race – this very room! – is filled with Herods. We may not all kill babies out of fear, but our fear does drive us toward death. Think of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do our fears – of rejection, of failure, of powerlessness – drive us to do to <em>rupture</em> our relationships with God and with our fellow humans?</li>
<li>What do our fears – of intimacy, of scarcity, of being taken advantage of – prevent us from doing to <em>foster</em> those same relationships?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sisters and brothers, we Christians cannot afford an escapist religion of mere sentimentality which is out of touch with this broken and twisted world.</p>
<h3 id="we-cannot-afford-an-escapist-religion-because-we-do-not-worship-an-escapist-god"><strong>We</strong> <strong>cannot afford an escapist religion because we do not worship an escapist God!</strong></h3>
<p>Now , remember: <strong>evil is incomprehensible</strong>. It is the impossible possibility – a headlong dive, away from the source of Life and Light, into the arms of nothingness and darkness. <strong>It</strong> <strong>makes no sense!</strong></p>
<p>Therefore , some neat and tidy “answers” to the problem of evil can themselves be evil – by trying to explain that which cannot be explained!</p>
<p>Don’t offer or seek such “answers.” It’s better to remain silent, or to cry out <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”</strong></em> Job did. Jesus did.</p>
<p>JESUS DID…on the Cross!</p>
<h3 id="evil-cannot-and-should-not-be-explained-but-it-can-has-been-and-will-be-defeated"><strong>Evil cannot and should not be explained. But it can, has been, and will be defeated!</strong></h3>
<p>Although it does not lessen the tragedy, King Jesus, the commander of heaven’s armies, did not abandon these baby boys, his very first standard-bearers, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Chrysologus">Peter Chrysologus</a> noted. Instead, he sent them on ahead of himself into victory.</p>
<p>Although it does not lessen the tragedies we face, our God does not escape evil and suffering at our expense.</p>
<p>Sure , he escaped Herod once…in order to make it to the <u>Cross</u>,where he took Sin and Death to their bitter end in our stead.</p>
<p>He went into the furthest and fullest exile – the grave –in order to bring us back from our exile.</p>
<p>This return will look a bit different from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Zion">return</a> in 538 BC, for it will be full and final.</p>
<p>As our <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearABC/HolyDays/HolyInno.html#EPISTLE">second lesson</a> today describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.</p>
<p>He will dwell with us, and we will be his people, and God himself will be with us as our God.</p>
<p>He will wipe away every tear from our eyes, from the eyes of Bethlehem’s mothers and from the eyes of Bethlehem’s babies.</p>
<p>And death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”</p></blockquote>
<p>God, the Alpha and the Omega, whose justice and mercy far outstrip our own, will make all things new.</p>
<p><strong>God will be our God.</strong></p>
<p>And because of His Son – who joined us in our distant depths, and went into exile in our stead to bring us home – <strong>We will be God’s daughters and sons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Image" loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fear-leaeds-to-anger-yoda-quote-from-star-wars.jpg?w=590"></p>
<p>A great green theologian of old claimed that anger is based on fear, that it leads to hatred, and results in suffering. And while I do not wish to disregard the wisdom of a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I would like to take a closer look at anger as discussed in Scripture, and to consider what makes certain instances of anger righteous or unrighteous, legitimate or illegitimate.</p>
<p>This is a question that has been on my mind throughout my final year at Cedarville University. After hearing of a few rumblings at the end of my Junior year, I left for the summer and got myself married. When my feet finally touched the ground at the beginning of term, my university felt like a battlefield. I heard that Michael Pahl had been “reviewed” and then fired over the summer months. Others were being reviewed to see if they really did toe the doctrinal line, or if they were guilty of mind crimes against the thought police. And things didn’t get any better from there.</p>
<p>I saw the havoc that the Cedarville environment was wreaking on my mentors, friends, and their families. My leaders got rid of and harassed beloved members of my community, and then deceptively refused to own up to their nefarious actions.</p>
<p><a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2786885016/098d40ad39a165603e09a1915c37f88a.jpeg"></a><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/">I got angry. I spoke up</a>. And I was convinced that my anger was righteous. Others were less convinced.</p>
<p>Some stayed poignantly and painfully silent throughout the chaos. Others repeatedly gave platitudes that everything was OK, that we were obligated to trust our leaders, that to question their actions was inherently disrespectful. And some from this latter group met my kind of anger with their own frustration and anger that I dared to criticize their beloved Cedarville.</p>
<p>I’d love to say that I met this opposition with nothing but grace and equanimity, but that wouldn’t be true. I frequently lashed out against these types of people – when they sent me long messages to accuse me of causing unnecessary dissentious strife, or when they parodied us student activists as complete morons with nothing better to do than cook up conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>My university’s behavior was sickening, but these people’s behavior was infuriating. I couldn’t comprehend how they could overlook the suffering I was witnessing and try to protect people who were clearly hiding the truth. So, at times, I lashed out in frustration. And I am convinced that my anger was unrighteous. But what’s the difference between these two types of anger?</p>
<p>Before considering how we should be rightly angry, I’d like to ask three questions. The first is for our great green theologian:</p>
<h1 id="yoda-does-righteous-anger-exist">YODA, DOES RIGHTEOUS ANGER EXIST?</h1>
<p>According to Yoda and friends, there is no such thing as legitimate anger, at least not humanly-speaking. After all, doesn’t Proverbs (29:11, NET) say that:</p>
<p>“A fool lets fly with all his temper,</p>
<p>but a wise person keeps it back.”?</p>
<p>And James (1:19-20) says:</p>
<p>“Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness.”</p>
<p>Or what about when Paul says (Eph 4:31-32):</p>
<p>“You must put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling, and slanderous talk—indeed all malice. Instead, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ also forgave you.”</p>
<p>When these verses are combined with our all-too-familiar ways of speaking about “gentle Jesus, meek and mild,” anger ends up getting quite the bad rap! Aren’t Christians supposed to “turn the other cheek” (Matt 5:39)? Aren’t we supposed to keep calm and stay in line – head down, Bible open, mouth shut?</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, Scripture provides a much more complex view of anger than this.</p>
<p>For example, consider Ephesians 4:26-27. Four verses before the command to “put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling … [and] all malice,” Paul tells the Ephesian believers to “Be angry and do not sin.” However, he then continues with the admonition to “not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger” and to “not give the devil an opportunity.”</p>
<p>Although Paul’s seemingly contradictory counsel here is usually used to denounce anger as an appropriate emotion, a closer analysis of these two verses in context appears to give righteous anger a legitimate place when sin infects the Christian community. That is, giving the devil a foothold could refer to either the sin which anger might produce, or to allowing the sin which caused the anger in the first place to fester, but it is not an indictment of the anger itself.</p>
<p>And this is probably for the best, because examples abound of Yahweh, his Son, and his servants getting quite angry!</p>
<p>Consider Exodus 22:22-24:</p>
<p>“You must not afflict any widow or orphan. If you afflict them in any way and they cry to me, I will surely hear their cry, and my anger will burn and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives will be widows and your children will be fatherless.</p>
<p>In the original Hebrew, this passage is even more intense, along the following lines: “If you afflict them <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in even the slightest way</span>, and they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">even think about crying out</span> to me, then I will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hearingly hear</span> their cry. My <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fiery anger will burn</span>, and I will kill you with the sword, so that, in exchange, YOUR wives will be widows and YOUR children will be orphans.” So much for gentle Yahweh, meek and mild!</p>
<p>In the New Testament, we see that the Son of God gets angry as well. After all, when he witnesses money-changers making his Father’s holy house into a marketplace, he doesn’t calmly suggest that they leave. Instead, he makes a whip, flips their tables, scatters their coins, and drives them out of the temple! (Jn 2:13-22).</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider Jesus’ anger at the hypocritical practices of both the scribes and the Pharisees (Matt 23). He calls them children of hell (23:15), blind fools (23:17), whitewashed tombs (23:27), the offspring of vipers (23:33), and descendants of those who murdered the prophets (23:31)!</p>
<p>And speaking of the prophets, as some of Yahweh’s most faithful servants in the midst of faithless generations, they got quite angry themselves! Examples abound, but one of my personal favorites is Amos 7:16-17, the prophet Amos’s response to being told by Amaziah not to preach against Jeroboam and Israel:</p>
<p>So now listen to the Lord’s message! You say, ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel! Don’t preach against the family of Isaac!’</p>
<p>“Therefore this is what the Lord says:</p>
<p>‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets</p>
<p>and your sons and daughters will die violently.</p>
<p>Your land will be given to others</p>
<p>and you will die in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.’”</p>
<p>Based on the behavior of Yahweh, Jesus, and the prophets, it seems that we should reconsider Yoda’s position and at least acknowledge that righteous anger exists. In at least some circumstances, it is possible to be angry and please God.</p>
<p>Our second question, then, is for the most successful Hebrew prophet, who got angry for all the wrong reasons:</p>
<h1 id="jonah-are-you-really-so-very-angry">JONAH, ARE YOU REALLY SO VERY ANGRY?</h1>
<h1><img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Jonah-_A_VeggieTales_Movie.jpg/220px-Jonah-_A_VeggieTales_Movie.jpg"></h1>
<p>I’m presupposing that you all know the basic story of Jonah. You know, the bit about how he refuses to go to the Assyrian capital (Nineveh), gets himself cast into the sea and swallowed by a huge fish, and eventually goes to preach a one sentence prophetic message that turns out to be remarkably successful – everyone from the Ninevite king to the Ninevite cattle repented in sackcloth!</p>
<p>However, the book of Jonah is a much richer literary work than we often give it credit. As just one example out of many ingenious literary moves in the book, us readers never find out Jonah’s motivation for his disobedience, reluctance, and frustration until the fourth and final chapter. As was read earlier, Nineveh’s repentance and Yahweh’s relent from judgment…(Jonah 4:1-4)</p>
<p>displeased Jonah terribly and he became very angry. He prayed to the Lord and said, “Oh, Lord, this is just what I thought would happen when I was in my own country. This is what I tried to prevent by attempting to escape to Tarshish!—</p>
<p>What Jonah has to say next, however, is even more shocking!</p>
<p>because I knew that you are gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in mercy, and one who relents concerning threatened judgment. So now, Lord, kill me instead, because I would rather die than live!”</p>
<p>Jonah’s not angry because of injustice or even inconvenience…he’s angry because of God’s mercy or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>hesed</em></span>: his gracious, compassionate, relenting, merciful, and steadfast love! But before we consider the heinous nature of such anger, let’s note that this is a theologically astute observation on Jonah’s part. He’s quoting a creed which gets at the heart of who Yahweh is:</p>
<p>Consider Exodus 34:6</p>
<p>The Lord passed by before him and proclaimed: “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in loyal love (hesed) and faithfulness,</p>
<p>Nehemiah 9:17</p>
<p>But you are a God of forgiveness, merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and unfailing in your loyal love (hesed).</p>
<p>Psalm 86:15</p>
<p>But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God.</p>
<p>You are patient and demonstrate great loyal love (hesed) and faithfulness.</p>
<p>Joel 2:13</p>
<p>Return to the Lord your God,</p>
<p>for he is merciful and compassionate,</p>
<p>slow to anger and boundless in loyal love—often relenting from calamitous punishment.</p>
<p>Yahweh is slow to anger (literally “long of nostrils,” picture the deep sigh you give when someone frustrates you) and abounding in <em>hesed</em>, which predisposes him toward mercy, compassion, and even relenting from judgment, as he had just done with the Ninevites. And THIS is what makes Jonah so upset.</p>
<p>Instead of being joyful at the broad scope of the Gospel as God’s redemptive mission, at the remarkable success of his brief prophetic endeavor, and at the complete repentance of the Ninevite people, Jonah is furious because God has broken his mold. Yahweh had chosen to relent and to redeem the Ninevite other, and for Jonah, this was simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>Yahweh’s first rhetorical question, “Are you really so very angry?” (4:4) fails to bring Jonah around. And things get even worse. Jonah goes to sit and see what would happen to Nineveh. God sends a <em>qiqayon</em>, a little plant, to provide shade for the ornery prophet, and Jonah was very delighted. However, Yahweh the masterful teacher then sends a worm to devour the plant and a hot east wind to make Jonah faint. True to form, Jonah again cries out in anger: “I would rather die than live!” (4:8).</p>
<p>Yahweh challenges Jonah again: “Are you really (or rightly) so very angry about the little plant?” Jonah replies: “I have good reason to be angry, even to death (NASB or) I am as angry as I could possibly be!” (4:9).</p>
<p>Then Yahweh brings the lesson home with force: “You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight. 11 Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city (implied: for which I worked and which I caused to grow!) in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals? (4:10-11, NASB)”</p>
<p>Jonah’s anger was unrighteous in that it was a self-centered hindrance to God’s mission. By scorning Yahweh’s mercy and ignoring the broad scope of his redemptive <em>hesed</em> love, Jonah disdained the repentance of the Ninevite other. He got angry for all the wrong reasons. And yet his failures are a powerful indictment against our own. After all, at least 90% of my anger is driven by selfish concerns. It’s not even an “us vs. them” moment most of the time. It’s usually ME vs. everyone else! and I can’t often care any LESS about God’s redemptive mission, as long as the checkout line’s moving too slowly for my liking, as long as the car in front of me just cut me off, as long as there’s someone on the internet with whom I disagree!</p>
<p>If it’s so easy to fall into Jonah-like frustration, is there any hope left for righteous anger?</p>
<p>Let’s ask the prophet who got to preach Jonah’s dream message against Nineveh:</p>
<h1 id="nahum-why-is-god-so-angryfilenahum-prophetjpg">NAHUM, WHY IS GOD SO ANGRY?<img alt="File:Nahum-prophet.jpg" loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Nahum-prophet.jpg"></h1>
<p>In the seventh century BC, Nahum got to preach the prophetic oracles against Nineveh that Jonah had wanted to utter. Apparently, although Nineveh and the Assyrians had been used by God as an instrument of judgment in the eighth century exile, they had grown prideful of their vicious pursuits. Drunk with the blood of their victims, the Assyrians paid no mind to Yahweh who had allowed them to thrive. This brought about a change in the divine approach to the Assyrian empire. We can see this in Nahum’s modification of the traditional credal statement mentioned above. Let’s take another look at Nahum 1:2-3:</p>
<p>The Lord is a zealous and avenging God;</p>
<p>the Lord is avenging and very angry.</p>
<p>The Lord takes vengeance against his foes;</p>
<p>he sustains his rage against his enemies.</p>
<p>3 The Lord is slow to anger but great in power;</p>
<p>the Lord will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.</p>
<p>If you’ll compare Nahum 1:3 with Jonah 4:2, you’ll see what I mean. Although the traditional form is “Yahweh is slow to anger, but great in <em>hesed</em>,” Nahum switches <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>hesed</em></span> out with <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>power</em></span>. No longer would the vicious Assyrians experience the merciful and steadfast love of Yahweh. As <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Nahum+1:3">one commentator puts it</a>, “God’s patience at the time of Jonah one century earlier had run out. Nineveh had exhausted the “great mercy” of God and now would experience the “great power” of God.” The rest of the book of Nahum is a series of oracles describing exactly what this would mean.</p>
<p>I believe that Nahum’s devastating oracles against Nineveh were important to the Hebrew mindset because they preserved Yahweh’s powerful justice as the counterpoint to the themes of merciful universalism in books like Jonah. Nahum’s relationship to Jonah is a bit like the relationship of Job and Ecclesiastes to Proverbs. The former provide important theological counterpoints to the latter books. In Jonah, Yahweh desires to teach the arrogant Hebrew prophet a lesson about the scope of the divine mission of mercy and redemption. Although it’s understandable why Jonah would have been hesitant to see Nineveh repent and be delivered from judgment (given Assyria’s messy relationship with Israel), Yahweh wanted to show Jonah that NO ONE was outside of his mercy’s reach. In fact, sometimes Ninevites repent better than God’s chosen people!</p>
<p>But what about when the Ninevites are consistently guilty of atrocities against God’s people? Sure, that doesn’t mean Israel should go all Jonah on them and discount the possibility of repentance/deliverance ever occurring, but what about on God’s end of the deal? Is he so merciful that he no longer cares about injustice? Is he getting soft? Turning into some passive nice guy who’s only mildly bothered by things like slaughter and oppression?</p>
<p>Books like Nahum answer those kind of painful questions cried out by victims of oppression:</p>
<p>No. Yahweh is not complacent when it comes to heinous sin. In fact, he hates it more than any human possibly could. This does not negate his mercy – the message of Jonah still stands – but he is not a passive onlooker when it comes to Sin and Death and those who enact them. He is a mighty warrior on a mission of redemption and deliverance, especially when it comes to the powerless and the oppressed. This theme echoes throughout the pages of Scripture, from the Exodus to the Cross to the coming Kingdom. The righteous anger of Yahweh is redemptive, and it usually focuses on the mistreatment of the weak.</p>
<h1 id="how-then-should-we-be-angry">HOW, THEN, SHOULD WE BE ANGRY?</h1>
<p>If Yoda, Jonah, and Nahum have taught us anything, we should acknowledge that the crucial difference between righteous and unrighteous anger is whether it helps or hinders God’s redemptive mission, the Gospel. It’s important, then, that we sit long with Scripture and the Church in order to better know what the Gospel really is. The more clearly we understand the foundational Gospel principles of things like <em>shalom</em> peace, <em>hesed</em> love, and <em>mishpat</em> justice, the more likely it is that we’ll recognize the appropriate things to get angry about. As we become more familiar with God’s redemptive mission, we should gently remind Yoda and others that there is indeed a place for anger which is pleasing to God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should heed the warnings of Jonah’s failures, lest our anger be just as self-centered and Gospel-opposed as his was. After all, we can ALWAYS stumble down Jonah’s path. When it comes to my anger against my alma mater and my online detractors, as much as I’d like to paint the unjust fundamentalists as the Jonahs of the story… I’m just as much like Jonah when I refuse to believe that God can work through them, when I place them outside of the scope of God’s redemptive mission. We do well to consider continually whether our anger is stubbornly self-centered, and to remind ourselves that Yahweh is (insert deep, calming sigh) slow to anger and abounding in hesed. The people of God should strive to exemplify the same attributes.</p>
<p>However, Nahum reminds us that God will not be mocked. He takes oppressive opposition to his redemptive mission very seriously, and the divine warrior’s wrath is kindled when Sin and Death rear their ugly heads in this world. He rages against the violence, poverty, famine, hunger, disease, disasters, and indifference which kill untold millions of his precious image-bearers each year. His fiery anger burns when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-selective_abortion">baby girls are killed for nothing more than their gender</a>, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Savar_building_collapse">people die amid the rubble of poorly-built factories for the sake of corporate greed</a> – the idols of wealth and power, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS">children have to witness their parents die from HIV/AIDS</a>, not knowing how long they and their siblings have before the disease takes their lives as well. If these things do not anger us, something is wrong.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most infuriating thing to Yahweh is when those who have been redeemed in and through his precious Son commit injustices in his holy name! I can only imagine how angry it makes God that his people treat others as inferior beings – be it <a href="http://dannimoss.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/paige-patterson-on-domestic-violence/">women</a>, or <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2006/winter/christian-nativism#.UZgp2LWG3ng">immigrants</a>, or <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">homosexuals</a>, or <a href="http://www.biblerays.com/race-mixing.html">other races</a>, or the poor – for the sake of a pretentious and profane pride they DARE to call holiness.</p>
<p>Or what about the divine heartbreak over the fragmentation of the Church? Can you imagine how much it upsets God when his people split for every little reason, in pursuit of supposed “purity,” ignoring that the goal of his redemptive mission is to reconcile all things to himself, to make us ONE in Christ?</p>
<p>To bring this closer to home, can you imagine how much it upsets God that <a href="http://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">my university</a>, which claims to exist “For the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ,” has repeatedly shown itself willing to mistreat godly people and then to lie about it? That the leaders of Cedarville are willing to buy the silence of the mistreated through non-disclosure agreements? That they are willing to appeal to God’s knowledge by using platitudes like “God is not surprised” to justify their actions against those who have less power? What happened to Michael Pahl and his family, <a href="http://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">in addition to many others this year within the Cedarville community</a> at the hands of those who claim Christ’s name has been appallingly shameful.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, we serve a God who is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast, merciful, and compassionate love. Let us not forget these things. May we, as God’s people, always be driven by the logic of his redemptive love.</p>
<p>But Yahweh is also immensely powerful and passionate, and often very angry about the effects of Sin and Death around the world and among his people. Therefore, let us not sin in our anger, as we are prone to do, but let us oppose sin in our righteous anger, with our eyes and our hearts turned toward the powerless, oppressed, sick, broken, and dying of this world as we further Yahweh’s redemptive mission and accomplish the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
