      <title>Christianity and Politics: My 2024 Reading List</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election. Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>As I’ve thought more about these topics, my reading list has grown, and I wanted to share it with you. It’s a mix of books I’ve read and some that are still on my to-read list. The first book that really shaped my thinking is <em><a href="https://amzn.to/43msglF">Resident Aliens</a></em>—a must-read if you’re interested in Christian political theology.</p>

<p>When it comes to abortion, I think it’s a tragedy that needs to be reduced, ideally through a consistent pro-life ethic. However, I’m also curious about progressive theological arguments for a pro-choice stance. Here are a few books I’m reading to explore those ideas:</p>

<h3 id="for-sleep">For Sleep</h3>
<p>O heavenly Father, you give your children sleep for the refreshing of soul and body: Grant me this gift, I pray; keep me in that perfect peace which you have promised to those whose minds are fixed on you; and give me such a sense of your presence, that in the hours of silence I may enjoy the blessed assurance of your love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<h3 id="in-the-morning">In the Morning</h3>
<p>This is another day, O Lord. I know not what it will bring forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I am to stand up, help me to stand bravely.

Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit of Jesus. <em>Amen.</em></p>

      <title>Logos 10 Bible Software: The Ultimate Theological Learning Tool</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/logos-10-bible-software-the-ultimate-theological-learning-tool/</link>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/logos-10-bible-software-the-ultimate-theological-learning-tool/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: If you’re serious about biblical and theological studies, you should invest in Logos 10 Bible Software. &lt;a href=&#34;https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;amp;AFID=529204&#34;&gt;Do so via my exclusive partner offer for Logos 10 here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp;amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quit laughing at &lt;em&gt;How to Read a Book&lt;/em&gt; by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study computer science sooner rather than later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR: If you’re serious about biblical and theological studies, you should invest in Logos 10 Bible Software. <a href="https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;AFID=529204">Do so via my exclusive partner offer for Logos 10 here!</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit laughing at <em>How to Read a Book</em> by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.</li>
<li>Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.</li>
<li>Study computer science sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when I finally became a Logos Bible Software customer in 2018 as a Ph.D. Student, Anglican Deacon, and Anglican website editor, it took my studies to the next level. I purchased a Logos 8 Anglican Silver package, <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/5758/barths-church-dogmatics">Karl Barth’s Church Dogmatics (31 Vols.)</a>, and <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/152651/dietrich-bonhoeffer-works-german-english">Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: German-English (34 Vols.)</a>, and I haven’t looked back since!</p>
<p>(NOTE: If you’re interested in the best FREE Bible and theology resources out there, then you NEED to check out <a href="https://bibleproject.com/">The Bible Project</a>, <a href="https://netbible.org/bible/Matthew+1#">The NET Bible</a>, and <a href="https://www.saet.ac.uk/index.php/articles">The St. Andrews Encyclopaedia of Theology</a>!)</p>
<h2 id="logos-10-worth-the-cost">Logos 10: Worth the Cost?</h2>
<p>Has it been a pricey investment over the years? To be sure.</p>
<p>However, even if I just consider the amount of <strong>time saved</strong> (1) looking things up and (2) citing works (which Logos handles AUTOMATICALLY when you copy and paste quotes!!!), I’ve come out on top</p>
<p>This is not to mention the breadth and depth that Logos Bible Software has added to my essays, sermons, emails (I used to receive a lot of Anglicanism-related questions!), and blog posts.</p>
<p>Now that Logos 10 is out, I can heartily continue to recommend Logos Bible Software. If you haven’t done so already, I strongly encourage you to consider buying (or upgrading to) Logos 10! (<a href="https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;AFID=529204">Again, you can do so via my exclusive partner link here!</a>)</p>

<h2 id="top-3-features-of-logos-10">Top 3 Features of Logos 10</h2>
<p>Real quick, here are my 3 favorite things about Logos 10 (compared to Logos 8 and 9).</p>
<h3 id="1-its-faster">1. It’s FASTER</h3>
<p>Right out of the box, you can tell that they’ve tweaked things under the hood to make Logos 10 run faster (noticeably faster on my 2016 MacBook Pro) than previous versions.</p>
<p>Especially when you’ve got a large library (I’ve got 3,975 items in my Logos library right now) and you’re using multiple resources at a time, running Logos Bible Software is computationally expensive. So I’m glad that the Logos team have made behind-the-scene improvements to the software that have yielded a noticeably superior user experience on my end!</p>
<h3 id="2-with-print-library-catalog-you-can-add-and-search-your-print-books">2. With Print Library Catalog, you can add and search your PRINT BOOKS</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/print-library-catalog">Print Library Catalog feature</a> is a game-changer, especially if you, like me, have quite a few physical biblical and theological books laying around!</p>
<p>If you add those physical books to your Logos Print Library Catalog, then, as long as Logos has digital versions of those books, you can use the power of Logos search to help you find things in your physical books!</p>
<p>This means that Logos Bible Software can now help you take better advantage of the physical books you already own! Genius.</p>
<h3 id="3-church-history-themes">3. Church History Themes</h3>
<p>As a student of historical theology, I’m a bit biased here, but I think that most Christians these days have a woefully inadequate understanding of Church history!</p>
<p>Granted, not everyone needs to become Church history experts! But all Christians should know at least the broad contours and the major themes from Church history. Let’s learn the most we can from saints who have gone before us!</p>
<p>Logos 10 makes a big step forward here with the new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/church-history">Church History Themes</a> feature. It’s a fantastic way to get up to speed on some of the most important movements and topics from the history of Christianity.</p>
<h3 id="4-bonus-auto-translation">4. (Bonus) Auto Translation!</h3>
<p>OK, we’re into the weeds a bit here, because I realize that not everyone will be interested in this. But, as someone who (attempted) a Ph.D. on two German-speaking theologians, let me just tell you that I REALLY wish this feature had been introduced earlier!</p>
<p>Logos 10’s new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/auto-translation">Auto Translation feature</a> makes it easier than ever to engage with works written in, say, Latin, French, or German right from Logos. I really hope that this kind of AI-assisted translation continues to improve, because there are so many works out there originally written in other languages. Plenty of these haven’t been translated into English yet. And, even when they have (looking at you, Barth’s Church Dogmatics), there’s really no replacement for engaging with a work in its original language.</p>
<h2 id="other-helpful-logos-10-bible-software-reviews">Other Helpful Logos 10 Bible Software Reviews</h2>
<p>I’ve only scratched the surface of the new and improved features of Logos 10. I’ll say it again, I strongly recommend that you <a href="https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;AFID=529204">invest in a Logos 10 Bible Software library</a>!</p>
<p>And don’t just take my word for it! Here are some other reviews of Logos 10 Bible Software that you should take a look at as you consider whether or not to purchase/upgrade:</p>

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the biblical and theological reasons for caring about social justice and systemic racism,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the unfair ways in which some have used accusations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Cultural Marxism to sideline legitimate Christian concerns about social justice and systemic racism, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the legitimate Christian critiques of CRT and Marxism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that there are plenty of resources out there that address each of the three items above!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<li>the biblical and theological reasons for caring about social justice and systemic racism,</li>
<li>the unfair ways in which some have used accusations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Cultural Marxism to sideline legitimate Christian concerns about social justice and systemic racism, and</li>
<li>the legitimate Christian critiques of CRT and Marxism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I <em>know</em> that there are plenty of resources out there that address each of the three items above!</p>
<p>I’m specifically looking for the resources that are the <em>easiest to understand</em> for someone who has little (or no) biblical, theological, or philosophical training. I’m thinking something that you could easily share with friends and relatives who have legitimate questions.</p>
<p>I’m also specifically looking for resources that address 2 or 3 of the items above, not just 1.</p>
<p>Do such resources already exist?</p>
<p>If not, should we start a Kickstarter to create a “Crash Course”-style YouTube video that addresses all three points above??</p>
<h2 id="my-current-shortlist-of-helpful-resources">My current shortlist of helpful resources</h2>
<p>To provide some grist for the mill, the following resources don’t address all three of my points above, but they <em>are</em> really good and they’re on my current short list of recommended resources for family and friends:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGUwcs9qJXY">Phil Vischer’s video on “Race in America”</a> (he’s the creator of VeggieTales and the voice of Bob the Tomato)</li>
<li><a href="https://ntwrightpage.com/2020/06/14/undermining-racism-complete-text/">N.T. Wright’s talk on “Undermining Racism”</a> (scroll to the bottom for a video of the talk)</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is a “collect” prayer that I composed for Juneteenth in 2020. What’s a “collect” prayer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short form of prayer, constructed (with many varieties of detail) from (1) an invocation, (2) a petition, and (3) a pleading of Christ’s name or an ascription of glory to God; and one of the most characteristic items in the W[estern] liturgy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3xqwpK0&#34;&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Almighty God, you rescued your people from slavery in Egypt, and throughout the ages you have never failed to hear the cries of the captives; We remember before you our sisters and brothers in Galveston, Texas who on this day received the glad tidings of their emancipation; Forgive us for the many grave sins that delayed that liberating word; Anoint us with your Spirit to bring good news to the poor, to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, and to proclaim the year of your favor; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

      <title>Top 3 Books, Movies, and Podcasts about Race for White Christians like Me</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/top-3-books-movies-and-podcasts-about-race-for-white-christians-like-me/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are PLENTY of resource recommendations out there for those interested in learning more about racism and anti-racism (just Google “best X (books, movies, podcasts, etc.) on racism,” “antiracist reading list,” etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’m worried that, especially for people who are not used to working their way through lengthy reading lists, getting so many recommendations at once will lead to nothing due to the paradox of choice. I’d much rather recommend a single book that someone will actually read than 100 books they won’t!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>However, I’m worried that, especially for people who are not used to working their way through lengthy reading lists, getting so many recommendations at once will lead to nothing due to the paradox of choice. I’d much rather recommend a single book that someone will actually read than 100 books they won’t!</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is the reading, viewing, and listening shortlist that I am starting with. I’ve been biblically and theologically opposed to racism for awhile now, but I was convicted by the Rev. Canon Dr. Esau McCaulley recently when he said, like a good professor, that “we can tell when you haven’t done the reading.” I’ve done a <em>bit</em> of the reading (mainly <a href="https://amzn.to/2zULBBn"><em>The Christian Imagination: Theology and the Origins of Race</em></a> by Willie James Jennings, <a href="https://amzn.to/3eUpvxz"><em>A Black Theology of Liberation</em></a> by James Cone, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2XyMloK"><em>How to be an Antiracist</em></a> by Ibram X. Kendi), but not nearly enough.</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking for a place to start, I recommend the following as a beginning. Within each category, take a brief look at all 3 and then start with the 1 that interests you the most.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2A8Lylg"> <em>White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism</em> </a>by Robin DiAngelo</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2XyMloK"><em>How to be an Antiracist</em></a> by Ibram X. Kendi (I’ve listened to this on Audible, but I need to revisit it, along with Kendi’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2UfR3Wh"> <em>Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America</em></a>)</li>

      <title>“But, What About the Riots and Lawlessness?”</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 21:47:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/but-what-about-the-riots-and-lawlessness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I commend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/race-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-one.html&#34;&gt;the entire interview series that Ed Stetzer recently did with Esau McCaulley&lt;/a&gt;. Among many highlights, I appreciate McCaulley’s following answer to the question of negotiating the differences between protests and riots. Again, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/racism-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-four.html&#34;&gt;read the whole interview&lt;/a&gt; and series, but here’s a key section related to concern about rioting and lawlessness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Ed Stetzer] We both agree: Protests are good. Riots are not. Unpack that for us from your context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esau: There is a cycle of what happens. There’s a racial incident. African Americans protest. Some of those protests from people inside and outside the community turn violent. People say, “Hey, look at this. Why aren’t the Christians who are speaking out against the racial injustice equally strong speaking about the riots?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Among many highlights, I appreciate McCaulley’s following answer to the question of negotiating the differences between protests and riots. Again, <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/racism-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-four.html">read the whole interview</a> and series, but here’s a key section related to concern about rioting and lawlessness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Ed Stetzer] We both agree: Protests are good. Riots are not. Unpack that for us from your context.</p>
<p>Esau: There is a cycle of what happens. There’s a racial incident. African Americans protest. Some of those protests from people inside and outside the community turn violent. People say, “Hey, look at this. Why aren’t the Christians who are speaking out against the racial injustice equally strong speaking about the riots?”</p>
<p>There are couple of things that I want to say about that. First, there is no real question as to where Christians stand on riots. There isn’t a kind of evangelical pro-riot, black riot faction. Therefore, on one level there is not a need to condemn rioting as a form of social protest, because everybody’s clear about this.</p>
<p>The problem is that the very people who are mad at us for not being strong enough against riots are the same people who say systemic racism isn’t a problem. This only manifests the contradiction.</p>
<p>There is no question we are all opposed to riots. There seems to be a question as to whether or not Christians should speak out against systemic oppression.</p>
<p>There needs to be a public and robust statement that the followers of Jesus are on the side of those who are being unjustly treated.</p>
<p>The second thing that I want to say about that is that if you want to talk to someone who is behaving in a way that is counterproductive, the first thing you need to do is actually show some empathy. If the first thing you do is you come in and say, “Law and order, law and order, law and order,” you’re not understanding the deep sense of frustration.</p>
<p>A riot is the manifestation of hopelessness.</p>
<p>The first thing that I try to do, and you’ve seen many African American leaders do this, is to say, “I get it. You’re frustrated. It seems like these videos will never stop, and this has been going on for years.” Then, once you’ve established that you care, you can begin to push back on the riot themselves.</p>
<p>You can’t come to a community that you hate and then rebuke them for behaving in a way that you don’t find is appropriate. You didn’t care about them anyway.</p>
<p>The only people who have the social and moral standing to speak to a community of unrest is people who at least can begin to understand the cause of that unrest.</p>
<p>As a Christian, I believe that the means and the ends must be one. You can’t have a good end with an improper means. If the end is justice, for the Christian the means themselves have to be just. The Christians who are protesting against systemic oppression, at least those who are biblically faithful, are the ones who are saying, “Ultimately, even if I understand some of the frustration that is going on, these riots are not a Christian means of advocating for social change.”</p>

      <title>Why is the word “systemic” a flashpoint for certain Christians?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/why-is-the-word-systemic-a-flashpoint-for-certain-christians/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 20:13:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/why-is-the-word-systemic-a-flashpoint-for-certain-christians/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the Bible has much to say about &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; sin and redemption. But (1) focusing on “systemic” issues doesn’t need to negate a focus on “individual” issues. In fact, a focus on “systemic racism” actually exerts a lot of pressure to evaluate people individually, and not on the basis of their race—as long as we keep in mind how those supposedly individual evaluations are often subtly (and nefariously) shaped by systemic issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Certainly, the Bible has much to say about <em>individual</em> sin and redemption. But (1) focusing on “systemic” issues doesn’t need to negate a focus on “individual” issues. In fact, a focus on “systemic racism” actually exerts a lot of pressure to evaluate people individually, and not on the basis of their race—as long as we keep in mind how those supposedly individual evaluations are often subtly (and nefariously) shaped by systemic issues.</p>
<p>And, more importantly, (2) the Bible also has a lot to say about structural sin and the communal nature of human life. For example, I’ve been reading through Ezekiel in the Daily Office, and he paints in some <em>really</em> broad brushstrokes when prophetically denouncing people. What about all the “good apples” that he and other prophets overlook? Sure, some of that is down to figures of speech that substitute the part for the whole and vice versa, but some of it is also the biblical truth that our actions have ripple effects in the various communities of which we are a part.</p>
<p>I’ll confess that, when I hear certain critiques of “systemic,” and especially “systemic racism,” those critiques sound like they’re based more upon Enlightenment individualism than they’re based upon the Bible. Now, of course, that doesn’t mean that everyone who speaks of “systemic” issues is speaking biblically!</p>
<p>But why shouldn’t Christians speak about “systemic” issues? It strikes me as unfair to assume that, once the word “systemic” is used, that we’ve abandoned the gospel. After all, “our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” (Eph 6:12). That’s one of the passages that come to mind when I speak against systemic racism.</p>
<p>Another passage that comes to mind is from earlier in the same epistle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11 So then, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, called “the uncircumcision” by those who are called “the circumcision”—a physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands— 12 remember that you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us. 15 He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace, 16 and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it. 17 So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; 18 for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father. 19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, 20 built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. 21 In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; 22 in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God. (Eph. 2:11–22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If these verses from Paul don’t at least have systemic implications (implications that, to be sure, involve human individuals!), then I don’t know what they’re about.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-fallibility-principle">1. The Fallibility Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Each participant in a discussion of a disputed issue should be willing to accept the fact that he or she is <strong>fallible</strong>, which means that <strong>one must acknowledge that one’s own initial view may not be the most defensible position on the question</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="2-the-truth-seeking-principle">2. The Truth-Seeking Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Each participant should be committed to the task of <strong>earnestly searching for the truth or at least the most defensible position on the issue at stake</strong>. Therefore, one should be willing to examine alternative positions seriously, look for insights in the positions of others, and allow other participants to present arguments for or raise objections to any position held on an issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-the-clarity-principle">3. The Clarity Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The formulations of all positions, defenses, and attacks should be <strong>free of any kind of linguistic confusion and clearly separated from other positions and issues</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the seventh edition, the following is added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is particularly important to <strong>define carefully any key words</strong> used in an argument or criticism that may be unclear or misunderstood.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-the-burden-of-proof-principle">4. The Burden-of-Proof Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>burden of proof for any position usually rests on the participant who sets forth the position</strong>. If and when an opponent asks, the proponent should provide an argument for that position.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5-the-principle-of-charity">5. The Principle of Charity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If a participant’s argument is reformulated by an opponent, it should be <strong>carefully expressed in its strongest possible version that is consistent with what is believed to be the original intention of the arguer</strong>. If there is any question about that intention or about any implicit part of the argument, <strong>the arguer should be given the benefit of any doubt in the reformulation and/or, when possible, given the opportunity to amend it</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="6-the-structural-principle">6. The Structural Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One who argues for or against a position should <strong>use an argument that meets the fundamental structural requirements of a well-formed argument</strong>. Such an argument does not use reasons that contradict each other, that contradict the conclusion, or that explicitly or implicitly assume the truth of the conclusion. Neither does it draw any invalid deductive inferences.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="7-the-relevance-principle">7. The Relevance Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One who presents an argument for or against a position should <strong>set forth only reasons whose truth provides some evidence for the truth of the conclusion</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="8-the-acceptability-principle">8. The Acceptability Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One who presents an argument for or against a position should <strong>provide reasons that are likely to be accepted by a mature, rational person and that meet standard criteria of acceptability</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="9-the-sufficiency-principle">9. The Sufficiency Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One who presents an argument for or against a position should <strong>attempt to provide relevant and acceptable reasons of the right kind, that together are sufficient in number and weight to justify the acceptance of the conclusion</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="10-the-rebuttal-principle">10. The Rebuttal Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One who presents an argument for or against a position should <strong>include in the argument an effective rebuttal to all anticipated serious criticisms of the argument that may be brought against it or against the position it supports</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="11-the-suspension-of-judgment-principle">11. The Suspension-of-Judgment Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If no position is defended by a good argument, or if two or more positions seem to be defended with equal strength, one should, in most cases, suspend judgment about the issue</strong>. If practical considerations seem to require a more immediate decision, one should weigh the relative benefits or harm connected with the consequences of suspending judgment and decide the issue on those grounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="12-the-resolution-principle">12. The Resolution Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An issue should be considered <strong>resolved if the argument for one of the alternative positions is a structurally sound one that uses relevant and acceptable reasons that together provide sufficient grounds to justify the conclusion and that also includes an effective rebuttal to all serious criticisms of the argument and/or the position it supports</strong>. Unless one can demonstrate that the argument has not met these conditions more successfully than any argument presented for alternative positions, one is obligated to accept its conclusion and consider the issue to be settled. If the argument is subsequently found by any participant to be flawed in a way that raises new doubts about the merit of the position it supports, one is obligated to reopen the issue for further consideration and resolution.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following checklist, found on pages 155–56 of Alan Jacobs’s excellent book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33TtBRv&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link), is a worthy addition to “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” (mentioned in my previous post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-come-up-with-rules-for-conversation/&#34;&gt;“Help me come up with ‘rules for conversation’!”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-embed-amazon-kindle wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-amazon&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-block-embed__wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;550&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?preview=inline&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;ref_=k4w_oembed_Eii2WAqN2ej4WE&amp;asin=0451499603&amp;tag=joshuapsteele-20&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%&#34; title=&#34;How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds&#34; type=&#34;text/html&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Emphasis added in **bold**.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When faced with provocation to respond to what someone has said, give it five minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. Take a walk, or weed the garden, or chop some vegetables. Get your body involved: your body knows the rhythms to live by, and if your mind falls into your body’s rhythm, you’ll have a better chance of thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value learning over debating&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t “talk for victory.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As best you can, online and off, &lt;strong&gt;avoid the people who fan flames&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to respond to what everyone else is responding to in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have to respond to what everyone else is responding to&lt;/strong&gt; in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness, or else lose your status in your community, then you should realize that &lt;strong&gt;it’s not a community but rather an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/&#34;&gt;Inner Ring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gravitate&lt;/strong&gt; as best you can, in every way you can, &lt;strong&gt;toward people who seem to value genuine community and can handle disagreement with equanimity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek out the best and fairest-minded of people whose views you disagree with.&lt;/strong&gt; Listen to them for a time without responding. Whatever they say, &lt;em&gt;think it over&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patiently, and as honestly as you can, &lt;strong&gt;assess your &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repugnance&#34;&gt;repugnances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes &lt;strong&gt;the “ick factor”&lt;/strong&gt; is telling; sometimes it’s a distraction from what matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of &lt;strong&gt;metaphors&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;myths&lt;/strong&gt; that do too much heavy cognitive lifting; notice what your &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terministic_screen&#34;&gt;terministic screens&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt; [See pages 90–91] are directing your attention to-and what they’re directing your attention &lt;em&gt;away from&lt;/em&gt;; look closely for hidden metaphors and beware the power of myth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to &lt;strong&gt;describe others’ positions in the language that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; use, without indulging in in-other-wordsing.&lt;/strong&gt; [See pg. 106: “We see it every day. Someone points at an argument—a blog post, say, or an op-ed column—and someone else replies, ‘In other words, you’re saying … ‘ And inevitably the argument, when put &lt;em&gt;in other words&lt;/em&gt;, is revealed to be vacuous or wicked.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be &lt;strong&gt;brave&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Help me come up with “rules for conversation”!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my role as Managing Editor for AnglicanPastor.com, I’m realizing the need to develop some “rules for conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the tone that we’re after as “clarity and charity,” which is an excellent summary. However, to guide our blogposts and comments, I think we need something more detailed and concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” seem like excellent starting points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, if you have any further suggestions, please let me know in the comments!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We describe the tone that we’re after as “clarity and charity,” which is an excellent summary. However, to guide our blogposts and comments, I think we need something more detailed and concrete.</p>
<p>With that in mind, “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” seem like excellent starting points.</p>
<p><strong>But, if you have any further suggestions, please let me know in the comments!</strong></p>
<h2 id="rapoports-rules">Rapoport’s Rules</h2>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/use-rapoports-rules-for-better-conversations-and-disagreements/">posted about these rules before on my blog</a>. Click that link for a bit more information. Here are the rules.</p>
<p>When critiquing someone else:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should <strong>attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”</strong></li>
<li>You should <strong>list any points of agreement</strong> (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</li>
<li>You should <strong>mention anything you have learned from your target.</strong></li>
<li>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of <strong>rebuttal or criticism</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adlers-advice">Adler’s Advice</h2>
<p>Rapoport’s Rules are an excellent start, but surely there’s more out there!</p>
<p>Mortimer Adler’s book, <em>How to Speak How to Listen</em> contains some practical advice in Chapter 11 on “How to Make Conversation Profitable and Pleasurable.”</p>
<p><em>(NOTE: Page numbers below are from the Scribd e-book. They might not perfectly coincide with the hardcover or paperback.)</em></p>
<h3 id="factorsobstacles">Factors/Obstacles</h3>
<p>First, Adler highlights four factors or obstacles that need to be recognized and overcome for a successful conversation to take place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: We must, of course, use it, but “it is a very imperfect medium of communication—cloudy, obscure, full of ambiguities and pitfalls of misunderstanding.” (136).</li>
<li><strong>Emotion</strong>(s): Perfectly fine in heart-to-heart talks, but “emotions are entirely out of place in impersonal conversations that have as their goal the achievement of better understanding and the attainment of agreement about the resolution of purely intellectual issues.” (138).</li>
<li><strong>Self-Knowledge</strong>: “Understanding one’s self is a necessary condition for understanding anyone else.” (138).</li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong>: “Saying what you mean is one of the hardest things in the world to do. Listening to what others say in order to discern what they mean is equally hard. Both call for expenditures of intellectual energy that many persons are loath to make.” (140).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Pick the right place and occasion for a conversation</strong>, one that provides sufficient time for carrying it on and one that is free from the annoyance of distractions that interrupt or divert it.” (140).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Know in advance what kind of conversation you are trying to have.</strong>” (141).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“For whatever kind of serious conversation it is to be, <strong>select the right people with whom to have it</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Don’t try to discuss everything with everybody. …</li>
<li>“Most important of all, never engage in the discussion of a problem with someone you know in advance has a closed mind on that subject.” (142).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Certain matters are undiscussable and, therefore, one should avoid discussing them</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“The familiar maxim, <em>de gustibus non disputandum est</em> [Latin: “about tastes, it should not be disputed”], is more often disobeyed than honored, and yet violating this rule always turns two-way talk into nothing more than an exchange of personal prejudices. …</li>
<li>“Only about matters concerning which objective truth can be ascertained is it worthwhile to engage in argument of one sort or another for the sake of ascertaining it.” (143–44).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t listen only to yourself</strong>.” (144).</p>
<ol>
<li>“All of us have had the experience of conversation that proceeds in the following manner. Brown speaks while Jones remains silent, not listening to what Brown says, but only waiting politely for Brown to finish, at which time Jones enters the conversation with a statement of something on his mind that may have no relation whatsoever to what Brown has just said. While Jones speaks, Brown also politely waits, but does not listen. When Jones finishes, Brown then expands on what he said earlier or talks about something else that in no way relates to what Jones has just expressed.</li>
<li>“They might just as well have been in different rooms talking to themselves, because that is the only person they have been listening to.” (144–45).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“A closely related rule calls on you to <strong>listen to a question with an effort to understand it before answering it, and then with an effort to address yourself to the question in the light of your understanding of it</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Many persons take questions as nothing more than signals for them to speak, uttering whatever happens to be on their mind at the moment, whether or not it has any relevance to the question that calls for their response.</li>
<li>“If you have any sense at all that you may not understand the question you have been asked, don’t try to answer it. Instead ask your interrogator to explain the question, to rephrase it in some way that makes it more intelligible to you.</li>
<li>“There is no point in trying to answer questions you do not completely understand. Keep at the task of reaching for that understanding before you attempt to answer.” (145).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“A parallel rule, if you are on the questioning rather than the answering end of a conversation, is to <strong>ask your questions as clearly and as intelligibly as possible</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“There is still one more rule about questions in relation to good serious conversation. <strong>Some people think that they are engaging in conversation when they ask another person one question after another, receiving each answer without commenting on it, and without any connection between the questions asked in sequence. This may be a form of interrogation that is useful under certain conditions and for certain purposes, but it is not a conversation in which the interchanges of two-way talk advance significantly from one point to another</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t interrupt while someone else is speaking</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t be rude</strong> by engaging in a side conversation while someone to whom you should be listening is talking.</p>
<ol>
<li>“<strong>At the same time, don’t be too polite. One should always be civil in the tone and manner of one’s utterances, but excessive politeness should not restrain one from saying what is on one’s mind.</strong></li>
<li>“If you think what you have to say may be offensive, try to phrase it in such a way that giving offense is avoided, but do not clam up when what you have to say deserves saying.” (145-46).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Recognize that <strong>anything that takes time should have a beginning, a middle, and an end.</strong> This is as true of a conversation as of a play or a symphony. …</p>
<ol>
<li>“The beginning should set the stage for the conversation by focusing on the theme—the problem, the question, the subject to be discussed.</li>
<li>“The middle, which should run for a longer time, should be devoted to exploring the problem, the question, or subject and should elicit all the differences of opinion that are relevant to it, with support for these opinions to be given by argument.</li>
<li>“The end should bring the conversation to a conclusion—a decision reached if the conversation has a practical purpose, a position agreed upon if the matter is theoretical.</li>
<li>“If agreement is beyond reach, then the conclusion may involve suspended judgment and the tabling of the matter in question for further conversation, and perhaps resolution, at a later time.” (145–47).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommendations-for-impersonal-conversations">Recommendations for Impersonal Conversations</h3>
<h4 id="intellectual-rules">Intellectual Rules</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“If you are an active participant in a conversation or discussion, your first obligation is to <strong>focus on the question to be considered.</strong> What is the problem to be solved, the issue to be settled, the subject to be explored? <strong>If the matter is complex</strong> and has a number of component elements, those engaged in the conversation would be well advised to <strong>break it up into its parts, label them, and put them in some order.</strong>” (150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Stick to the issue.</strong> Stay within the framework of the subject under consideration, either as a whole or with respect to one or another of its parts. Don’t wander off and talk about something else or intrude irrelevancies into the course of the conversation.” (150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Stick to the issue or the point, <strong>but don’t beat it to death.</strong> Don’t stay on it forever. Keep moving on to the next point when this one has been sufficiently explored or discussed.” (151).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Individuals not only bring unacknowledged assumptions to a conversation in which they are engaged, they also take part in it without knowing what their blind spots are—matters concerning which they lack understanding and have difficulty in attaining.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>“Like unacknowledged assumptions, blind spots can ruin a conversation or at least prevent the minds engaged in it from really meeting.”</li>
<li>“Be on the alert to <strong>recognize when you are failing to understand something and press for help in understanding it</strong>.</li>
<li>“You should <strong>be aware that you have certain preconceptions and assumptions, and try to dredge them up from the recesses of your mind and lay them on the table for everyone to examine</strong>.</li>
<li>“Since few conversations begin at the beginning and different things are taken for granted by the persons talking with one another, the rule might better be stated as follows. <strong>Ask your companions to grant the assumptions you wish to make, and state your own assumptions when it comes their turn to ask you for them.</strong>” (151–152).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Avoid the most obvious fallacies.</strong></p>
<ol>

<p>To make sure that you understand, before you disagree or agree, <strong>exercise the courtesy of asking the other person the following question: “Do I understand you to say that . . . ?”</strong> Fill in the blank by phrasing in your own words what you think you hear the other person saying. <strong>He may respond to this by saying to you, “No, that is not what I said or not what I meant. My position is as follows.”</strong> Then, after the other person has restated his position for you, you should once again try to state in your own words what you have understood the other to say. If the other still dissents from your interpretation, <strong>you must continue with this question and answer procedure until the other tells you that you have at last caught the point, that you understand him precisely as he wishes to be understood.

<li>“I think you hold that position because <strong>you are misinformed</strong> about matters that are critically relevant.” Then be prepared to indicate the mistakes the other has made, which, if corrected, would lead the other to abandon the position taken.</li>
<li>“I think you are sufficiently well informed and have a firm grasp of the evidence and reasons that support your position, but <strong>you have drawn the wrong conclusions from your premises because you have made mistakes in reasoning</strong>. You have made fallacious inferences.” Then be ready to point out those logical errors which, if corrected, would bring the other person to a different conclusion.</li>
<li>“I think you have made none of the foregoing errors and that you have proceeded by sound reasoning from adequate grounds for the conclusion you have reached, <strong>but I also think that your thinking about the subject is incomplete</strong>. You should have gone further than you did and reached other conclusions that somewhat alter or qualify the one you did reach.” Then be able to point out what these other conclusions are and how they alter or qualify the position taken by the person with whom you disagree.” (162–63).</li>

      <title>Two of Bonhoeffer&#39;s Most Convicting Paragraphs</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/two-of-bonhoeffers-most-convicting-paragraphs/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:33:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/two-of-bonhoeffers-most-convicting-paragraphs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is from Bonhoeffer’s &lt;em&gt;Discipleship&lt;/em&gt; (usually known as “The Cost of Discipleship” in English, although the original title in German was simply &lt;em&gt;Nachfolge&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonhoeffer considers how we might respond to Jesus if Jesus were to show up and make the same kinds of concrete commands that he did in the Gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: I’ve taken two paragraphs in the original and broken them up into smaller chunks to facilitate reading here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is from Bonhoeffer’s <em>Discipleship</em> (usually known as “The Cost of Discipleship” in English, although the original title in German was simply <em>Nachfolge</em>).</p>
<p>Bonhoeffer considers how we might respond to Jesus if Jesus were to show up and make the same kinds of concrete commands that he did in the Gospels.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: I’ve taken two paragraphs in the original and broken them up into smaller chunks to facilitate reading here.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Jesus Christ were to speak this way [he told the rich young ruler to sell his possessions] to one of us today through the Holy Scripture, then we would probably argue thus:</p>
<p>Jesus is making a specific commandment; that’s true. But when Jesus commands, then I should know that he never demands legalistic obedience. Instead, he has only one expectation of me, namely, that I believe.</p>
<p>My faith, however, is not tied to poverty or wealth or some such thing. On the contrary, in faith I can be both—rich and poor. The main concern is not whether or not I have any worldly goods, but that I should possess goods as if I did not possess them, and inwardly I should be free of them. I should not set my heart on my possessions.</p>
<p>Thus, Jesus says, “Sell your possessions!” But what he intends is that it is not important if you actually do this literally, outwardly. You are free to keep your possessions, but have them as if you did not have them. Do not set your heart on your possessions.</p>
<p>Our obedience to Jesus’ word would then consist in our rejecting simple obedience as legalistic obedience, in order to be obedient “in faith.”</p>
<p>This is the difference between us and the rich young man. In his sadness, he is not able to calm himself by saying to himself, “In spite of Jesus’ word, I want to remain rich, but I will become inwardly free from my riches and comfort my inadequacy with the forgiveness of sins and be in communion with Jesus by faith.” Instead, he went away sadly and, in rejecting obedience, lost his chance to have faith. The young man was sincere in going away. He parted from Jesus, and this sincerity surely had more promise than a false communion with Jesus based on disobedience.</p>
<p>Apparently Jesus thought that the young man was unable to free himself inwardly from his wealth. Probably the young man, as a serious and ambitious person, had tried to do it himself a thousand times. The fact that at the decisive moment he was unable to obey the word of Jesus shows that he failed. The young man was sincere in parting from Jesus.</p>
<p>By the way we argue, we distance ourselves fundamentally from a biblical hearer of Jesus’ word.</p>
<p>If Jesus said: leave everything else behind and follow me, leave your profession, your family, your people, and your father’s house, then the biblical hearer knew that the only answer to this call is simple obedience, because the promise of community with Jesus is given to this obedience.</p>
<p>But we would say: Jesus’ call is to be taken “absolutely seriously,” but true obedience to it consists of my staying in my profession and in my family and serving him there, in true inner freedom.</p>
<p>Thus, Jesus would call: come out!—but we would understand that he actually meant: stay in!—of course, as one who has inwardly come out.</p>
<p>Or Jesus would say, do not worry; but we would understand: of course we should worry and work for our families and ourselves. Anything else would be irresponsible. But inwardly we should be free of such worry.</p>
<p>Jesus would say: if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also. But we would understand: it is precisely in fighting, in striking back, that genuine fraternal love grows large.</p>
<p>Jesus would say: strive first for the kingdom of God. We would understand: of course, we should first strive for all sorts of other things. How else should we survive? What he really meant was that final inner willingness to invest everything for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Everywhere it is the same—the deliberate avoidance of simple, literal obedience.</p>
<p>How is such a reversal possible? What has happened that the word of Jesus has to endure this game? That it is so vulnerable to the scorn of the world?</p>
<p>Anywhere else in the world where commands are given, the situation is clear. A father says to his child: go to bed! The child knows exactly what to do.</p>
<p>But a child drilled in pseudotheology would have to argue thus:</p>
<p>Father says go to bed. He means you are tired; he does not want me to be tired. But I can also overcome my tiredness by going to play. So, although father says go to bed, what he really means is go play.</p>
<p>With this kind of argumentation, a child with its father or a citizen with the authorities would run into an unmistakable response, namely, punishment. The situation is supposed to be different only with respect to Jesus’ command. In that case simple obedience is supposed to be wrong, or even to constitute disobedience.</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>

      <title>Let&#39;s learn how to be bored again</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2019 17:32:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/lets-learn-how-to-be-bored-again/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://imagejournal.org/article/in-praise-of-boredom/&#34;&gt;“In Praise of Boredom,” by James K.A. Smith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know at least this: Instagram won’t save us, and tweeted verse will not undo what we’ve done to ourselves. But neither is there any special enchantment to reading in print. So this is not the Luddite’s redoubt, nostalgically canonizing codex or canvas as if history had come to an end in some glorious past. Every medium now reaches us inside the ecology of attention masterminded by Silicon Valley. We take pictures of our books and coffee, for heaven’s sake. The point isn’t platform but desire: what do we want when we pick up our phones? We don’t need better media, or to romanticize old media. We need to change what we want.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>In a world of incessant distraction, the way out might look like learning how to be bored. A little ennui could go a long way; it could be the wardrobe we need now. We need to learn how to be bored in order to wean ourselves off distraction and open ourselves to others and the Other—to make ourselves available for irruptions of grace.</p>

      <title>A Prayer of Confession</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To start off the semester the other day, we prayed this prayer of confession together as a class. The professor didn’t remember where the prayer was from, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/a-corporate-confession-of-faith-based-on-the-ten-commandments-and-the-sermon-on-the-mount/&#34;&gt;I tracked it down online. According to Justin Taylor, it was written by Bob Kauflin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy and righteous God, we confess that like Isaiah, we are a people of unclean lips. But it is not only unclean lips we possess. We are people with unclean hands and unclean hearts. We have broken your law times without number, and are guilty of pride, unbelief, self-centeredness and idolatry. Affect our hearts with the severity of our sin and the glory of your righteousness as we now acknowledge our sins in your holy presence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We have loved to praise our own glory more than yours.</p>

<p>We have prayed religious prayers to impress others.</p>
<p>We have uttered your name countless times without reverence or love.</p>

<p><strong>We have murdered in our hearts.</strong></p>

<p>We have justified our lusts by using the world as our standard.</p>
<p><strong>We have stolen what is not ours and coveted what belongs to others.</strong></p>
<p>Our lives overflow with discontent, ungratefulness, and envy.</p>
<p>We have complained in the midst of Your abundant provision.</p>
<p>We have sought to exalt ourselves through owning more.</p>
<p><strong>We have lied to you and to others.</strong></p>
<p>We have told distorted truths, half-truths, and untruths.</p>
<p>We have despised the truth to make ourselves look better.</p>
<p>Even in our confession, we look for ways to hide our guilt.</p>
<p><strong>O God, we have sinned against your mercy times without number. We are ashamed to lift up our faces before you, for our iniquities have gone over our heads. If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? How shall we answer you? We lay our hands on our mouths. We have no answer to your righteous wrath and just judgment.</strong></p>
<p>We have no answer. But God Himself has mercifully provided one for us.</p>

      <title>What Attracts People to Anglicanism? Here&#39;s My Take</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based upon my work over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/&#34;&gt;Rookie Anglican&lt;/a&gt;, I was asked by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teloscollective.com/&#34;&gt;The Telos Collective&lt;/a&gt; to write a blog post about the different ways that people are coming into Anglicanism. What’s drawing them in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teloscollective.com/what-attracts-people-to-anglicanism-subversive-cultural-resonance/&#34;&gt;read my full post over at the Telos Collective blog&lt;/a&gt;, but here’s a taste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based upon my work over at <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">Rookie Anglican</a>, I was asked by <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com/">The Telos Collective</a> to write a blog post about the different ways that people are coming into Anglicanism. What’s drawing them in?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com/what-attracts-people-to-anglicanism-subversive-cultural-resonance/">read my full post over at the Telos Collective blog</a>, but here’s a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).</p>
<p>No “culture of this world” can be equated with the culture of Jesus Christ. This is, I suggest, the important sense in which Christians (and not just Anglican ones) should not be “seeker-sensitive.”</p>
<p>And yet, on the other hand, the very mission of the church seems to demand that Christians be “seeker-sensitive” in the best sense of the phrase. This is because the gospel, though it does contain a powerful critique of a world alienated from God, is only “good news” to the extent that it resonates with (and does not merely refute) the cultures in which it is proclaimed.</p>
<p>So, perhaps we Anglicans need to do a better job of being “seeker-sensitive”—in the sense of resonating with the culture(s).</p>
<p>“Resonating” with the culture, however, does not necessarily mean “approving.” Instead, the church’s resonance with the cultures around it will frequently be “subversive” (again, see Scot McKnight’s previous piece).</p>
<p>Toward that end, I’d like to consider some ways in which I’ve noticed the Anglican tradition subversively resonating with the culture(s) around it—especially those in the United States of America in recent years.</p>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>“He was angry at God because women were rejecting him,” Mr. Peterson says of the Toronto killer. “The cure for that is enforced monogamy. That’s actually why monogamy emerges.”</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson does not pause when he says this. Enforced monogamy is, to him, simply a rational solution. Otherwise women will all only go for the most high-status men, he explains, and that couldn’t make either gender happy in the end.</p>
<p>“Half the men fail,” he says, meaning that they don’t procreate. “And no one cares about the men who fail.”</p>
<p>I laugh, because it is absurd.</p>
<p>“You’re laughing about them,” he says, giving me a disappointed look. “That’s because you’re female.”</p>
<p>But aside from interventions that would redistribute sex, Mr. Peterson is staunchly against what he calls “equality of outcomes,” or efforts to equalize society. He usually calls them pathological or evil.</p>
<p>He agrees that this is inconsistent. But preventing hordes of single men from violence, he believes, is necessary for the stability of society. Enforced monogamy helps neutralize that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, here is a perfect example of how easy it is to misunderstand Peterson. When he says “enforced monogamy,” he’s using a technical anthropological term, one that has to do with social norms, and not enforcing monogamy by assigning sexual partners through the use of state (or other) power/violence.</p>
<p><a href="https://jordanbpeterson.com/media/on-the-new-york-times-and-enforced-monogamy/">Peterson himself has attempted to clarify this since the NYT piece</a>, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, let’s summarize. Men get frustrated when they are not competitive in the sexual marketplace (note: the fact that they DO get frustrated does not mean that they SHOULD get frustrated. Pointing out the existence of something is not the same as justifying its existence). Frustrated men tend to become dangerous, particularly if they are young. The dangerousness of frustrated young men (even if that frustration stems from their own incompetence) has to be regulated socially. The manifold social conventions tilting most societies toward monogamy constitute such regulation.</p>
<p>That’s all.</p>
<p>No recommendation of police-state assignation of woman to man (or, for that matter, man to woman).</p>
<p>No arbitrary dealing out of damsels to incels.</p>
<p>Nothing scandalous (all innuendo and suggestive editing to the contrary)</p>
<p>Just the plain, bare, common-sense facts: socially-enforced monogamous conventions decrease male violence. In addition (and not trivially) they also help provide mothers with comparatively reliable male partners, and increase the probability that stable, father-intact homes will exist for children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, of course, you can still disagree with Peterson’s take here. However, it seems unfair to make it sound like he thinks women should be assigned to men against their wishes.</p>
<h1 id="the-shocking-truth-about-jordan-peterson-by-wesley-yang-tablet">“The Shocking Truth About Jordan Peterson,” by Wesley Yang (Tablet)</h1>
<p>This piece by Wesley Yang is currently my favorite take on Jordan Peterson, because it offers such a nuanced critique.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/262280/jordan-peterson">Wesley Yang writes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is something uneasily poised at the border of grandiosity and grandeur, heroism and quixotism, about Peterson that makes him appealing to undergraduates at the same time as it makes him a target-rich environment for haughty intellectuals and snarky journalists. There are literally tens of thousands of graduate students and ex-graduate students who know more about the intricacies of postmodern thought than Jordan Peterson does. Peterson’s tweeted and blogged responses to the Times piece are indicative of a person with virtually no sense of how he will be regarded by those who do not share his private system of reference. Why don’t you recognize that I’m not speaking of actual men and women but the symbolic Masculine and Feminine in Jungian archetypal thinking? Why don’t you know that “Enforced Monogamy” is an anthropological term? You won’t understand anything about Jordan Peterson until you realize that his confusion on these questions is entirely sincere.</p>
<p>So what does Peterson actually believe? He has consistently defended the moral position that the “individual is sovereign over the group,” a unique feature of Anglo-American political theory and practice that holds that citizens hold their rights against the state rather than through it, which is inscribed into our founding documents, and helps to account for the remarkable capacity of societies built around its doctrines to accommodate high levels of diversity while remaining democratic. The underlying sovereignty of individuals forces state power to operate against a hard constraint that limits coercion, and gives individuals the means by which to push back.</p>
<p>This position is not a “centrist” position between the poles of alt-right and the identity politics of the left, but a distinct position orthogonal to both. It rejects group identity as the foundation of politics in favor of strengthening the individual as a bulwark against what Peterson calls “ideological possession”—the temptation to subordinate the various ends of life into a contest for group dominance. Peterson sees the emergence of identity politics on both the right and left as a single phenomenon, with each pole feeding the growth of the other, as individuals lost amidst the chaos of contemporary life turn to ideologies providing simple solutions to complex questions, a corresponding set of friends—and a corresponding set of enemies. How anyone who has spent a single afternoon on Twitter can doubt that these polarizing group psychological dynamics exist—and explain the growth of political extremism at a time of relative prosperity—is frankly perplexing to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, on the one hand, Peterson should be held responsible for some of his rhetoric, and he should take a bit more care to ensure that he’s being correctly understood by his various audiences. On the other hand, Peterson’s views are quite MODERATE. He is not the radical right-wing ideologue that many people make him out to be.</p>

<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400introductionspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three or so decisions you make each day about what to eat are some of the most consequential choices you make in your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author Wendell Berry notes that, “eating is an agricultural act.” That is, eating is more than just the satisfaction of appetite. Our plates are food’s final destination in a long supply chain that runs </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">through a restaurant or grocery store, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">through food packing facilities, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">guided by the hands of food workers, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">often over thousands of miles via truck and train, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">through commodity processing facilities, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">all the way back to a farm. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This backstory is both daunting and empowering, because the food choices we make – what we eat, and who we buy it from – send economic signals through all corners of this supply chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a part of a broken world, contemporary food production it is filled with injustice and often creates suffering. But, it does not have to be that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bible clearly calls Christians to work towards a just future, to work with the grain of the gospel, as it were, by participating in the redemptive work that God is doing in the world. One of the most needed areas for this redemption is the modern food system. </span></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400factory-farmingspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factory Farming</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most consumers assume that their meat comes from farms where animals graze and wander around green, pastoral landscapes. That could not be further from the truth. </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400animal-sufferingspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animal Suffering</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://farmforward.com/ending-factory-farming/#easy-footnote-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vast majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (&gt;99%) of the more than 10 billion chickens, turkeys, pigs, and cows slaughtered each year in the US for meat are raised on factory farms, industrial facilities often referred to as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built to maximize efficiency and profits, these farms are hell on earth for their inhabitants. Animals are </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cafo+pictures&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGqOXlv6DYAhUL5oMKHUF2AogQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=835"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overcrowded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prevented from moving freely or performing natural behaviors. Many never see sunlight or grass at any point in their lives, and are fed unnatural diets of subsidized feed crops such as corn and soybeans — enduring </span><a href="https://www.mercyforanimals.org/the-problem"><span style="font-weight: 400;">miserable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lives that are cut short by slaughter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that they reach slaughter weight quickly, chickens have been bred to feel constant hunger and eat constantly. Breeds that used to take 6 months to reach full size now regularly attain that weight in one month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put that growth in perspective, imagine a human baby reaching full physical maturity at</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">age 3, instead of taking 18 years. As a consequence of this rapid growth, many chickens have an insufficient skeletal structure and are frequently crippled by bones that break under the stress of their unnaturally large weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this cruelty would be illegal if done to companion animals like dogs or horses, but it is regularly inflicted on billions of animals who have similar levels of intelligence and emotional complexity without a second thought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cows, pigs, chickens, and other animals experience a wide range of emotions, including curiosity, pleasure, pain, fear, joy, anger, sadness, playfulness and more. They most certainly have the capacity to suffer, and suffer they do, innumerable animals in unimaginable conditions. </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400environmental-costsspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, animal agriculture comes with a hefty environmental price tag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meat production is </span><a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/studies-link-red-meat-and-climate-change-20264"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resource-intensive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Producing one pound of feedlot beef takes an average of 2,500 gallons of water, 12 pounds of grain, 35 pounds of topsoil and one gallon of gasoline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation </span><a href="http://www.fao.org/animal-production/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that almost 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the planet’s total agricultural land is used for feeding or processing meat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, animal agriculture </span><a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emits more greenhouse gases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the entire transportation system – all cars, trains, planes and ships – and is responsible for more emissions than any other economic sector.</span></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-grain-of-the-gospel-eden-shalom-and-the-world-to-comespan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grain of the Gospel: Eden, Shalom, and the World to Come</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current food system bears all the markings of a broken system, and is surely not what Christians should envision for a redeemed world. The gospel message is that creation was made good, it belongs to God, it is in a broken state, but God is at work redeeming the world and bringing about its complete reconciliation.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-created-worldspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Created World</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the original created order of Eden, all creatures lived peacefully in community, and God told humans to consume only plant-based foods:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then God said, ‘I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.’ And it was so.” (Genesis 1.29–31) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animals were not created to be food for humans or for each other, but to be companions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Lord God said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.’ Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. [God] brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals” (Genesis 2.19-20)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this context, the God-given “dominion” over animals implies a parent-child relationship, not a hunter-hunted dynamic. As </span><a href="https://www.petalambs.com/scripture-and-testimonies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this piece from PETA LAMBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts it:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“God created humans in God’s image and according to God’s likeness and told humans to steward this new creation. And what is God’s likeness? Throughout the Scripture, God shows us mercy that we do not deserve, grace that we have not earned, and love that we cannot imagine. We are made in that likeness and are charged with reflecting those qualities to the whole of creation. Being made in the image of God is a call to caretaking, compassion, and mercy.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eden was a herbivorous world, filled with animals that were created to be companions with humans. Eating meat begins after human pride and greed allow brokenness into the world. </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-fallen-worldspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fallen World</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the new human-created order, Creation has been marred, good things have been repurposed for evil, blood is being shed, and instead of living in a peaceful community of God’s original design, humans are now violent toward animals and each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can choose to live either </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">against</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the grain of the gospel. Every time we eat meat, we necessarily participate in this fallen order and comply with the imperfections of this world. But, when we avoid killing other creatures, our efforts are directed away from brokenness and towards reversing the curse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Fall is a part of our present reality, Christians are called to work towards reversing its effects, not accentuating them. The Fall is the way the world is, but Eden and Heaven are the way it should be, and it seems good for Christians to participate in building the fully redeemed world to come rather than deepening the effects of the Fall.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-future-worldspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Future World</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prophecies such as Isaiah 11.6–9 seem to foresee a return to this vegetarian world: </span></p>
<p>The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat,<br>
</span>and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together;<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and a little child shall lead them.<br>
</span>The cow and the bear shall graze;<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> their young shall lie down together;<br>
</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.<br>
</span>The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra,<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den.<br>
</span>They shall not hurt or destroy<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> in all my holy mountain;<br>
</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord<br>
</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> as the waters cover the sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The redeemed world to come, the kingdom that God is building on earth, is an herbivorous kingdom, free from death and suffering. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God declares ownership of animals ( Psalm 50.10) </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God will protect all creatures (Isaiah 7.18-25), and they will all worship their Creator (Isaiah 43.20)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Righteous people are mindful of the needs of animals (Proverbs 12:10)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God makes a covenant with animals (Hosea 2.18)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God did not necessarily desire animal sacrifices (Isaiah 1.11)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murder of an ox or a human are both described as wrong (Isaiah 66.3)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God seems concerned for the welfare of both animals and people (Jonah 4.11)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, reconciled world, the wolf will lie down with the lamb, and a child will lead them. Hurt and destruction will pass away, and the lion will eat straw like the ox (Isaiah 11.3-9 and 65.25)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-this-a-valid-theological-argument">Is this a valid theological argument?</h2>
<p><strong>It is important to note that Christians should not always operate on the basis of the world to come in the midst of the world as it is.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There will not be marriage in the world to come (Matt. 22.30), nor will people teach each other about God (Jer. 31:34), but these are both acceptable things to do in the present age. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why should eating meat be any different?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their roots going back beyond the Fall to God’s good creation, marriage and teaching about God are good things to do in the present, but will become unnecessary in the world to come. Eating meat, on the other hand, cannot be traced back beyond the Fall. It is an unneeded, negative act in the present and will be impossible in a fully redeemed world. We do not have the license to act violently in the present world just because the future perfect world is not yet fully realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we eat meat-free diets, we are participating in the redemptive work that God is doing in the world, actualizing a future where humans and animals will live in community as nonviolent companions. </span><a href="https://www.thebanner.org/features/2018/02/eating-toward-shalom-why-food-ethics-matters-for-the-21st-century-church"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew C. Halteman summarizes it well</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Caring for animals was the very first responsibility bestowed to humankind by God—our very first chance to practice the capacities of love, power, and mercy that accompany the divine image within us…Someone seeking to eat mindfully aspires to live toward the biblical ideal of shalom—the peaceful state of holistic flourishing that is portrayed first in Eden and last on the holy mountain of the prophet Isaiah’s vision of a fully redeemed world.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400conclusionspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing meat consumption has many benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global poverty reduction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Food costs would decrease as less crops would be used for meat production and instead fed directly to humans</span></li>
<li><strong>Reduced animal suffering</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Fewer animals would be bred and raised in terrible conditions</span></li>
<li><strong>Improved public health</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Risks for cardiovascular disease and cancer – together responsible for 50% of U.S. deaths – would be reduced</span></li>
<li><strong>Healthier planet</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Air &amp; water pollution would be reduced and far fewer resources would be needed to produce our food</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating is an agricultural, economic, and spiritual act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we can eat either </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">with </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">against </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">the grain of the gospel, Christians need to see ethical food choices as everyday acts of virtue. Christians need to become food theologians, acquiring a moral imagination that sees animals as valuable co-heirs of the present and future world, and finding ways to look beyond the habits and comforts of our current food system to participate in a better, redeemed alternative.</span></p>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/what-to-make-of-jordan-peterson-some-takes-then-my-own/</guid>

<p>If I remember correctly, I first heard of and listened to Jordan Peterson on <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/08/31/podcast-335-using-power-myths-live-flourishing-life/">an episode of The Art of Manliness podcast</a>. (Or perhaps it was <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2018/02/06/12-rules-for-life-jordan-peterson-interview/">this episode</a>.)</p>

<p>Blog posts, podcast episodes, conversations with friends – Peterson has been popping up everywhere, so it seems.</p>
<h2 id="gerald-mcdermotts-take">Gerald McDermott’s Take</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/northamptonseminar/2018/02/03/biblical-wisdom-secular-psychologist/">old seminary professor, Gerald McDermott</a>, has blogged about Peterson’s new book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522244418&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=12+rules+for+life&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=joshuapsteele-20&amp;linkId=3dbfc723801c4d44e8f654a5e7da752c">12 Rules for Life: an Antidote to Chaos</a>,” saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a good book, blunt and inspiring.</p>
<p>We live in a time when so many young (and not so young) people feel lost, unsure of how they should approach their lives, or life in general. Mr. Peterson talks about the attitudes that will help find the path. It is not a politically correct or officially approved path, but it is an intensely practical and yet heightened one: This life you’re living has meaning.</p>

<h2 id="scot-mcknights-blogs-patrick-mitchells-take">Scot McKnight’s Blog’s (Patrick Mitchell’s) Take</h2>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/01/29/jordan-petersons-12-rules/">Scot McKnight blogged (or rather, published a guest post by Patrick Mitchell) about Peterson’s 12 Rules</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is he saying?</p>
<p>This is a big question because, as he says himself, he talks a lot, often too much and often at speed. He also covers a lot of ground from psychology, to philosophy, to men and women, to the Bible, to politics, to the world of work and freedom of speech. What follows is a snap-shot, drawn from listening to Peterson over the last year.</p>
<p>And the fact that what he is saying is now seen as ‘provocative’ or ‘radical’ or ‘patriarchal’ or ‘extreme’ says more about a contemporary culture of relativism and victimhood than it does about Peterson. Finding out more about his ‘reputation’, I have had to keep asking myself, ‘am I missing something?’. ‘Is this guy a member of some secret right-wing network?’ For I can’t see the evidence in his academic lectures, written material or YouTube videos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the post is <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/01/29/jordan-petersons-12-rules/">a pretty detailed look at various aspects of Peterson’s thought</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-infamous-channel-4-interview">The Infamous Channel 4 Interview</h2>
<p>Both of those blogs mention Peterson’s now infamous Channel 4 interview where Cathy Newman adopts some pretty aggressive and apparently unfair interviewing tactics (listen for “so you’re saying…,” followed by caricatures of Peterson’s claims):</p>

<h1 id="other-takes-on-peterson">Other Takes on Peterson</h1>
<hr>
<p>First, here are a couple explicitly “theological” takes:</p>
<h2 id="first-things-jordan-peterson-unlikely-guru-matthew-schmitz">First Things: “Jordan Peterson, Unlikely Guru” (Matthew Schmitz)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/04/jordan-peterson-unlikely-guru">Schmitz’s entire piece</a> is worth reading, but here was the kicker, in my opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What critics and fans alike miss is just how unlikely a guru Peterson is. Though he brims with sympathy for the confused, he is uncertain about where they should go. He advocates for rules but is vague on who should set them. He believes in the importance of religion, but he doesn’t quite have one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schmitz concludes the piece with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Young men look to Peterson for answers, but he is still turning the kaleidoscope, searching for pattern and form. Earlier this year, an interviewer for VICE asked him, “Who is your target audience, who are you trying to reach?” With eyes downcast he said, “Partly me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="think-theology-peterson-driscoll-and-the-millenial-man-matthew-hosier">Think Theology: “Peterson, Driscoll, and the Millenial Man” (Matthew Hosier)</h2>
<p><a href="http://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/peterson_driscoll_the_millennial_man">Mathew Hosier, at Think Theology, confesses that some of Peterson’s talk of personal responsibility reminds him of Mark Driscoll</a>. Nevertheless, he admits that he thinks Peterson is different than Driscoll:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of what happened at Mars Hill, it is undeniable that Driscoll’s genius was connecting with and motivating young men. They responded in their droves to his yelling at them to take responsibility for themselves and others. He painted a picture of the possible that was more compelling for many Millennials than the needs-based, rights-oriented culture in which they had been raised.</p>
<p>Peterson has observed how his lectures attract a surprisingly large number of young men too. Peterson is a very different character from Driscoll, but his challenge to young men to ‘pick up the heaviest rock you can and carry it’ is strikingly similar. Many Millennial young men seem confused about what it is to be a man and something leaps in them when another man tells them what they can do about it: shoulder a load, take some responsibility, clean your room and make life better for you and for those around you.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Other, less (explicitly) theological takes on Peterson abound:</p>
<h2 id="the-atlantic-why-cant-people-hear-what-jordan-peterson-is-saying-connor-friesdorf">The Atlantic: “Why Can’t People Hear What Jordan Peterson is saying?” (Connor Friesdorf)</h2>
<p>Focusing on the Channel 4 interview, Friesdorf concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…this is neither an endorsement nor a condemnation of Peterson’s views. It is an argument that the effects of the approach used in this interview are pernicious.</p>
<p>For one, those who credulously accept the interviewer’s characterizations will emerge with the impression that a prominent academic holds troubling views that, in fact, he does not actually believe or advocate. Some will feel needlessly troubled. And distorted impressions of what figures like Peterson mean by the words that they speak can only exacerbate overall polarization between their followers and others, and sap their critics of credibility to push back where they are wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="vox-jordan-peterson-explained-zack-beauchamp">Vox: “Jordan Peterson, Explained” (Zack Beauchamp)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144166/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life">Zack Beauchamp has a long write-up on Jordan Peterson in Vox magazine</a>, which concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Peterson has inextricably intertwined his self-help approach with a kind of reactionary politics that validates white, straight, and cisgender men at the expense of everyone else. He gives them a sense of purpose by, in part, tearing other people down — by insisting that the world can and should revolve around them and their problems.</p>
<p>This painful contrast is on display later in that very interview, in which he explicitly argues that concern for sexism is to blame for the plight of the West’s young men.</p>
<p>“We’re so stupid. We’re alienating young men. We’re telling them that they’re patriarchal oppressors and denizens of rape culture,” he says. “It’s awful. It’s so destructive. It’s so unnecessary. And it’s so sad.”</p>
<p>The empathy that he displays for men and boys in his BBC interview and 12 Rules for Life is touching. The problem is that he can’t seem to extend it to anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: From what I know of Peterson, Beauchamp’s take strikes me as unfair. Peterson himself isn’t trying to validate “white, straight, and cisgender men at the expense of everyone else</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-new-york-times-the-jordan-peterson-moment-david-brooks">The New York Times: “The Jordan Peterson Moment” (David Brooks)</h2>
<p>In my opinion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/opinion/jordan-peterson-moment.html">David Brooks hits the nail on the head here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of Peterson’s advice sounds to me like vague exhortatory banality. Like Hobbes and Nietzsche before him, he seems to imagine an overly brutalistic universe, nearly without benevolence, beauty, attachment and love. His recipe for self-improvement is solitary, nonrelational, unemotional. I’d say the lives of young men can be improved more through loving attachment than through Peterson’s joyless and graceless calls to self-sacrifice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I wouldn’t exactly call Peterson’s calls to self-sacrifice “joyless and graceless.”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-new-yorker-jordan-petersons-gospel-of-masculinity-kelefa-sanneh">The New Yorker: “Jordan Peterson’s Gospel of Masculinity” (Kelefa Sanneh)</h2>
<p>Similarly, I think that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/jordan-petersons-gospel-of-masculinity">Kelefa Sanneh hits the nail on the head here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peterson sometimes asks audiences to view him as an alternative to political excesses on both sides. During an interview on BBC Radio 5, he said, “I’ve had thousands of letters from people who were tempted by the blandishments of the radical right, who’ve moved towards the reasonable center as a consequence of watching my videos.” But he typically sees liberals, or leftists, or “postmodernists,” as aggressors—which leads him, rather ironically, to frame some of those on the “radical right” as victims. Many of his political stances are built on this type of inversion. Postmodernists, he says, are obsessed with the idea of oppression, and, by waging war on oppressors real and imagined, they become oppressors themselves. Liberals, he says, are always talking about the importance of compassion—and yet “there’s nothing more horrible for children, and developing people, than an excess of compassion.” (This horror, he says, is embodied in the figure of the “Freudian devouring mother”; as an example, he cites Ursula, the sea witch from “The Little Mermaid.”) The danger, it seems, is that those who want to improve Western society may end up destroying it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, time for some thoughts of my own.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="my-current-take-on-jordan-peterson">My Current Take on Jordan Peterson</h1>
<h2 id="first-hes-definitely-on-to-something">First, he’s definitely on to something.</h2>
<p>There’s no denying it, Jordan Peterson is striking a chord. And, I believe, that’s at least partially due to the fact that he’s RIGHT.</p>
<p>Despite the existence of structural sins and systems of oppression, it simply will not do to blame the world for all of one’s problems. At some point, we must take responsibility for our own lives.</p>
<p>I believe that the Christian doctrine of the imago Dei — of humans being created in the image of God — can theologically underwrite Peterson’s emphasis on responsibility. We humans have been created by God and given stewardship over the earth (see Genesis 1-2). Perhaps, despite the effects of the Fall (see Genesis 3), we have more control over our lives than we might realize.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there’s plenty of content in biblical Wisdom Literature (see Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, especially) to support what Peterson is saying about how to live your life in a way that fights back against the chaos of the world.</p>
<h2 id="and-yet-his-individualism-worries-me">And yet, his individualism worries me.</h2>
<p>Sure, we’re created in the imago Dei, and that means we have control and responsibility for our lives.</p>
<p>And yet, humans are communal creatures. So, if we overemphasize <em>individual</em> responsibility, we might end up underemphasizing the ways in which we are responsible for one another, including — and especially — the oppressed and the outcasts.</p>
<p>Now, Peterson is prone to claim that any talk of systemic oppression these days is due to the Radical Left, but I don’t buy his over-generalizations on that count. The Bible seems to bear witness to the existence of structural sin, and Christians must take systems of oppression into account as they discern how to follow Jesus.</p>
<p>Granted, Peterson isn’t simply saying “it’s every man for himself, forget about the losers.” He’s much more nuanced than that.</p>
<p>But still, I find his views of the world — at least as expressed in 12 Rules for Life — to be more individualistic than the account I see in Christian Scripture.</p>
<h2 id="furthermore-he-seems-to-fall-into-the-very-trap-he-attempts-to-avoid-victimhood">Furthermore, he seems to fall into the very trap he attempts to avoid: victimhood.</h2>
<p>Peterson is trying to provide an alternative, a middle way, to the Radical Left and the Radical Right. However, some of his rhetoric about the Radical Left — justified though it may be in certain circumstances, given what appear to be widespread mischaracterizations of his thought! — sometimes seem to fall into the very trap of “victimhood” that he encourages his audience to avoid.</p>
<p>It goes something like this: Peterson claims that it’s the Radical Left that’s oppressing people — specifically, men — by insisting that people are either oppressors or the oppressed.</p>
<p>Again, Peterson’s not flat-footed or unnuanced about this, but in some of his less-careful moments, he seems to fall into what he’s labeling as the Radical Left’s trap by painting himself and his audience as victims of a Radical Leftist conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Then again, perhaps that’s because Peterson’s been the target of quite a few misinterpretations and attacks. Maybe he gets some grace to have certain less-careful moments, as it were.</p>
<p>And yet, if he’s <em>really</em> going to provide a middle way between Right and Left ideologies, he needs to avoid the victim/oppressed rhetoric consistently.</p>
<h2 id="finally-he-plays-fast-and-loose-with-divine-revelation-and-religious-traditions">Finally, he plays fast and loose with divine revelation and religious traditions.</h2>
<p>I think it’s great that Peterson has respect for religion and religious narratives.</p>
<p>And yet, I think it’s pretty awful that Peterson feels free to float lightly above all religious narratives and basically craft a Petersonian “meta-religion” of his own out of the bits and pieces of religious narratives that he finds most useful and compelling.</p>
<p>Sure, sometimes his theological interpretation of biblical texts seems pretty thought-provoking, excellent, and faithful to the Christian tradition. However, at other times I find myself bracing at the idiosyncrasies of his interpretations — not to mention the ease with which he pulls in building blocks from various traditions to craft his own narrative. It makes me wonder if adherents of other religious traditions would feel a similar unease when their narratives are used in such a construction project.</p>
<p>By respecting all/most religious traditions, Peterson may very well end up respecting no particular religious tradition. As a Christian theologian, I find that troublesome.</p>
<h2 id="hes-worth-reading">He’s worth reading.</h2>
<p>After listening to the book on Audible, I bought myself a physical copy of 12 Rules for Life.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=joshuapsteele-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=0345816021&asins=0345816021&linkId=798f148b4266de5cd4854d35961356ee&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;"></iframe>
<p>I plan to read the book again and discuss it with friends. It’s currently the top non-fiction book on Amazon for good reason: it’s thought-provoking and it will get you thinking deeper about how to live your life in this world.</p>

      <title>Please Don&#39;t Leave Me Alone: On Male Friendships, or the Lack Thereof</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, consider yourself quite the introvert. Maybe you, like me, have a difficult time walking the tightrope between feeling quickly overwhelmed by interpersonal relationships, on the one hand, and feeling incredibly lonely, on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I’m sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be “alone together,” looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you, like me, consider yourself quite the introvert. Maybe you, like me, have a difficult time walking the tightrope between feeling quickly overwhelmed by interpersonal relationships, on the one hand, and feeling incredibly lonely, on the other hand.</p>
<p>Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I’m sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be “alone together,” looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).</p>
<p>Maybe we’re not alone.</p>
<h1 id="the-lonely-american-man">The Lonely American Man</h1>
<p>I just got done listening to a fantastic episode of the podcast Hidden Brain called <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/594719471/guys-we-have-a-problem-how-american-masculinity-creates-lonely-men">The Lonely American Man</a>.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you give this episode a listen, because it’s devoted to an important topic: how certain Western/American ideals of masculinity – the mythic man as a rugged individualist, needing no one in order to succeed – have led to men feeling increasingly isolated and lonely as they grow older.</p>
<p>I really resonated with this episode. Although my current role as a Ph.D. student (and my previous roles as a high school student, college student, and then a seminarian) have included some built-in male “acquaintances/colleagues,” at the very least, I’ve recognized how each stage has felt increasingly lonely. In fact, my closest male friendships now are with a couple people I know from high school – and we only see each other in person 1 or 2 times a year.</p>
<p>Sure, I spend more time face-to-face with my male Ph.D. colleagues, but we’re all just so busy. School, work, marriage, kids, etc. At least for me, in addition to feeling the pressure to not be overly emotional or vulnerable, there’s the added pressure of not wanting to burden other people. I know they’re busy. They know I’m busy. So, we end up just leaving each other alone, persuaded that’s what will make us happy (even if we feel terribly lonely).</p>
<p>If you listen to the end of the podcast episode I linked to above, you’ll hear about an interesting study/experiment performed on commuters. When given the choice/assignment of (1) not interacting with other commuters, (2) interacting with other commuters, and (3) carrying on as normal during their commute, people predicted that they would be happiest – and that other people would be happiest! – when they just stayed out of each other’s way. However, it turns out that we’re much happier when connecting with other people, and that other people are much more willing to connect with us than we often imagine!</p>
<h1 id="men-how-can-we-do-better">Men, How Can We Do Better?</h1>
<p>I need to do a better job of taking these things to heart in how I go about my daily life. Although I truly <em>am</em> an introvert – meaning that I need some time alone each day in order to recharge – I’m persuaded that I could benefit from some more meaningful friendships in my life – especially some more face-to-face friendships.</p>
<p>Although I’m sure there’s other great stuff on this topic out there, if you’re interested in this topic, I highly recommend the following posts from The Art of Manliness:</p>

<h3 id="unfortunately-there-are-a-ton-of-resources-out-there">Unfortunately, there are a TON of resources out there.</h3>
<p>Seriously, where are you supposed to begin? I just went to Amazon, and there are over 200,000 results in the category of Books &gt; Christian Books and Bibles &gt; Christian Living. To narrow things down, I clicked on the sub-category “Spiritual Growth,” and there are still over 40,000 results.</p>
<p>Look, I don’t mean to slight all of these Spiritual Growth resources out there. I really don’t. Some of them are excellent, and I may even write one of my own someday.</p>
<h3 id="however-in-my-view-the-explosion-of-spiritual-growth-material-createsexacerbates-the-danger-of-an-individualistic-and-consumeristic-approach-to-the-christian-life">However, in my view, the explosion of spiritual growth material creates/exacerbates the danger of an individualistic and consumeristic approach to the Christian life.</h3>
<p>If you wanted to, you could spend the rest of your life bouncing around from niche spiritual growth resource to niche spiritual growth resource. From one book study to the next. Getting tired of something? Try something new!</p>
<p>While there’s nothing wrong with novelty or changing things up to keep one’s spiritual life fresh, as it were, the danger is that we might end up with nothing but novelty, nothing but our individual interests driving our walk with the Lord.</p>
<p>If that happens, we’re going to miss out on the riches of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripture. All of Scripture, not just our favorite parts.</li>
<li>The Church: All of the Church, not just our local church, now, but the global Church, throughout history.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-solution-the-daily-office-of-morning-and-evening-prayer">The Solution: The Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer</h1>
<p>HEAR ME, HEAR ME: Doing the Daily Office will NOT solve all of your spiritual problems. That’s not what I’m saying. For one thing, you need the ministry of the Holy Spirit. For another, you need baptismal and eucharistic communion with the people of God.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer is an ancient Christian (and, even before that, Jewish!) tradition that, I believe, can help us avoid the individualistic and consumeristic dangers of the Christian spirituality industrial complex.</p>
<p>The Daily Office is NOT just an Anglican thing. However, the Anglican tradition is one of several Christian traditions that have preserved the practice. And so it is something that the Anglian tradition can offer the entire Body of Christ.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="here-are-5-things-that-you-can-learn-from-the-daily-office-of-morning-and-evening-prayer">Here Are 5 Things that You Can Learn from the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer</h1>
<h2 id="1-your-mornings-and-evenings-belong-to-god">1. Your Mornings and Evenings Belong to God</h2>
<p>Hopefully, you and I both know this already. Our entire day belongs to God!</p>
<p>However, I don’t know about you, but I need regular reminders that time – all of it – is sacred. This is why I appreciate the <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/what-time-is-it-an-overview-of-the-church-calendar-and-liturgical-year/">Church Calendar</a>, and it’s also why I appreciate the Daily Office. Beginning and ending each day with Scripture and prayer reminds me that the day and night in between prayer services belong to God.</p>
<p>By the way, the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer is not new, nor is it esoterically Anglican.</p>
<p>As Arthur Paul Boers noted in his <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/january8/2.40.html">2001 Christianity Today piece, “The Rise and Fall of the Daily Office,”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The practice of daily, set prayer goes back to the Old Testament. The Psalms speak of prayer in the morning (5:3), early hours (130:6), evening (141:2), and day and night (92:2). Psalm 119:164a says, “Seven times a day I praise you.” Scripture also mentions thrice-daily prayers (Ps. 55:17, Dan. 6:10). Jews said the Shema (a Scripture-based prayer praising God’s greatness) two or three times a day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The practice of the Daily Office or “fixed-hour prayer” developed from the Early Church through the Middle Ages, by which time it had developed into quite an elaborate monastic practice that was, by and large, inaccessible to the laity</p>
<p>One of many brilliant moves of Thomas Cranmer was to pare the medieval monastic hours of prayer down to the Daily Office of Matins (Morning Prayer) and Evensong (Evening Prayer) as it was included in <a href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1549/BCP_1549.htm">the 1549 (and subsequent) Book of Common Prayer.</a> Instead of learning Latin and praying 7 or 8 times a day, people could now pray twice a day in English, their native tongue.</p>
<h2 id="2-your-walk-with-god-is-about-more-than-just-your-emotions">2. Your Walk With God is About More Than Just Your Emotions</h2>
<p>Growing up and into college, my “daily devotions,” “quiet time,” or the lack thereof frequently depended upon my emotions. When I felt super spiritual, maybe after a youth retreat or something, I was pretty regular in my daily devotions. However, as the emotional high faded, so did my daily quiet times.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I discovered the Daily Office in seminary that I realized just how beneficial a structured approach to Scripture and prayer was. Doing the Daily Office, even when I didn’t (and don’t) particularly feel like it is a good reminder that (1) God desires faithful obedience and (2) I am more than just my emotions.</p>
<p>It’s called the Daily “Office,” by the way, as in Daily “Duty” or “Obligation.”</p>
<p>Wait, isn’t that legalism?? Well sure, your approach to the Daily Office can become legalistic. You can doggedly do it, even when you don’t feel like it, thinking that doing so is somehow earning you more of God’s love and favor.</p>
<p>But you would be wrong!</p>
<p>We don’t obey God’s commands in order to earn God’s love. Rather, we obey God’s commands because we have already been shown God’s love! We are commanded, for example, to love one another. But, of course, we love because God first loved us! (See 1 John 4.)</p>
<h3 id="heres-the-thing-though-for-our-own-good-we-still-need-to-obey-god-even-when-we-dont-feel-like-it">Here’s the thing, though: For our own good, we still need to obey God, even when we don’t feel like it!</h3>
<p>Sure, there’s no explicit command in Scripture to “do the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer.” However, we are commanded to pray (and rejoice/give thanks, see 1 Thess. 5:16-18 for just one example). We are also commanded to heed God’s holy Word (see, for example, Josh. 1:8; Psalm 119; Matt. 4:4; 1 Tim. 4:13).</p>
<p>So, at the very least, the Daily Office gives us the opportunity to obey God’s commands – even when we don’t feel like it.</p>
<h2 id="3-scripture-and-prayer-are-your-daily-food">3. Scripture and Prayer Are Your Daily Food</h2>
<p>Of course, Jesus said this best when he quoted Deuteronomy 8:3 in Matthew 4:4: <span class="text Matt-4-4" id="en-ESV-23214"><span class="woj">“It is written, </span></span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">‘Man shall not live by bread alone, </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”</span></p>
<p>I have found that doing the Daily Office, even when I don’t particularly feel like it, is a helpful reminder that Scripture and prayer are my daily food.</p>
<p>Do I remember exactly what I ate for breakfast last Wednesday? No.</p>
<p>Do I know that I ate something? Yes. Did it help keep me alive that day? Yes.</p>
<p>Similarly: Do I remember exactly what I read and prayed during Morning Prayer last Wednesday? No.</p>
<p>Do I know that I did Morning Prayer? Yes. Did it help to sustain and to shape me as a follower of Jesus Christ that day? Yes.</p>
<p>Sure, sometimes we will have moments of particular “transcendence” when reading the Bible and/or praying. However, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that Scripture and prayer are only meaningful to the extent that they <em>feel</em> meaningful. That would be like thinking a meal is only a good meal when it’s a steak dinner or something spectacular.</p>
<p>Scripture and prayer are meaningful, valuable, and necessary, even when they don’t feel particularly earth-shattering on any given morning or evening during the Daily Office.</p>
<p>That’s OK. Do the Daily Office and trust that God is sustaining and shaping you, even when it doesn’t feel like it.</p>
<h2 id="4-you-are-not-alone">4. You Are Not Alone</h2>
<p>Doing the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer is a great reminder that you are not alone when you’re reading the Bible and praying.</p>
<p>Ideally, this should be a very visible and tangible reminder! We should do the Daily Office with other Christians whenever possible.</p>
<p>However, even when you’re doing Morning or Evening Prayer “by yourself,” it’s comforting to know that Christians around the world (and, on another level, throughout history) are doing Morning and Evening Prayer. You are praying with (and, hopefully, for) the global, historic Church of Jesus Christ!</p>
<h2 id="5-god-loves-you-even-when-you-cant-get-your-act-together-and-do-the-daily-office">5. God Loves You, Even When You Can’t Get Your Act Together and Do the Daily Office!</h2>
<p>The Daily Office can be an encouragement – it can be good news – even when you fail to keep it!</p>
<p>Doing the Daily Office ought to remind us that our acts of faithful obedience are both meaningful and frail.</p>
<p>After all, it is so easy to forget or to skip Morning or Evening Prayer. It is so easy to fly through the prayers and the readings because we’re busy, tired, anxious, or all of the above. It is so easy to “fall short.”</p>
<p>And that’s OK! God still loves you!</p>
<p>Don’t fall prey to the lie that, if you can’t do the Daily Office perfectly, you might as well not do it at all.</p>
<p>No! Not true! None of us does anything perfectly!</p>
<p>Yet, God still loves us. And he still wants what’s best for us.</p>
<p>He wants our faithful obedience, but, in the comforting words of Psalm 103:14, “he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.”</p>

&lt;p&gt;First, for me, Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism. Now, to be sure, we do have our own fundamentalists within the Anglican Communion!

</a></p>
<p>Why am I an Anglican Christian? Here are 3 reasons.</p>
<h1 id="1-anglicanism-as-a-refuge-from-fundamentalism">1. Anglicanism as a Refuge from Fundamentalism</h1>
<p>First, for me, Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism. Now, to be sure, we do have our own fundamentalists within the Anglican Communion! But, compared to some “ingrown enclaves” I’ve experienced in my Christian upbringing, Anglicanism has been a breath of fresh air. It has been an ecclesiological space for healing as I seek to “<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/08/on-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater-a-message-for-abused-ex-fundamentalists/">not throw the (gospel) baby out with the (fundamentalist) bathwater</a>.”</p>
<p>Why/How?</p>
<h1 id="2-anglicanism-has-theological-breadth">2. Anglicanism has Theological Breadth…</h1>
<p>This goes hand-in-hand with my previous reason. Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism thanks in no small part to its “theological wiggle room.” The greatest strength of Anglicanism – and also the source of much of its angst – is its theological breadth. As a Ph.D. student in theology, I appreciate the fact that it doesn’t feel like I’m walking along the edge of a knife, to the right or left of which my positions would quickly become <em>verboten</em> by the Anglican powers that be.</p>
<p>Instead, it feels like I’m operating on a field of acceptable Anglican theological convictions/positions.</p>
<h1 id="3-within-a-tradition">3. …Within a Tradition</h1>
<p>However, that “field” does have boundaries, for which I am grateful!</p>
<p>And, for Anglicanism at its best, those boundaries largely coincide with the overarching tradition of the Christian Church as she has been sustained and guided by the Holy Spirit throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>So, on the one hand, I’m grateful for some theological wiggle room, as it were. On the other hand, I’m grateful that it’s not “just me and my Bible” as if I had to try to figure everything out anew!</p>
<p>The same Spirit, whom I trust to illuminate my mind and heart as I read Scripture, has provided the Church with teachers and leaders throughout the ages. This doesn’t mean that the “tradition” should be adopted wholesale, unthinkingly, and uncritically – far from it! But, the traditions of the Church ought to be received humbly and prayerfully.</p>
<p>So, to sum up: <strong>I’m an Anglican Christian because, with its theological breadth within the overarching Christian tradition, Anglicanism has provided a salutary refuge for me from fundamentalism.</strong></p>
<h1 id="why-are-you-an-anglican-christian">Why Are You an Anglican Christian?</h1>
<p>I could mention other reasons why I’m an Anglican Christian – such as the emphasis on the habitual rhythms of the Christian life (e.g., the <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/dailyofficebooklet/">Daily Office</a>, the liturgical <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/what-time-is-it-an-overview-of-the-church-calendar-and-liturgical-year/">calendar</a>, etc.). However, I’m going to stick with these 3, because I want to hear your story!</p>
<p>If you’re an Anglican Christian – why?</p>

      <title>Christians and Wealth: An Argument for Downward Mobility</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/christians-and-wealth-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2016 01:00:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/christians-and-wealth-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Great news! If you only have a minute to read about wealth, here’s my argument in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;outline-of-my-argument&#34;&gt;Outline of My Argument&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Claim: American Christians should reduce their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor and oppressed.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is the firmest advocate for human flourishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pursuit of wealth is spiritually dangerous and crippling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our culture’s inclinations toward upward financial mobility go against the message of the New Testament and the life of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is revealed in Scripture to have a special concern for the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians will be held accountable for how they treat the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objections:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This line of reasoning is advocating asceticism and is unbiblical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians have every right to keep what they have earned and to do what they wish with their excess funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the poor are lazy, Christians should not feel pressured to give, in case their generosity is taken advantage of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warrant:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians want to remain true to Scripture and submit to God’s way of life in order to find satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<p>Still interested in reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_poverty_and_wealth">this contentious topic</a>? Continue below.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In our current context of wealth and poverty existing side by side in a milieu of materialistic consumerism, the Christian gospel of denying ourselves and making much of God is being abandoned for the American gospel of denying others and making much of ourselves.</p>
<p>American Christians have become content to live a baptized version of the American dream, a hollow faith that is about maximizing your earthly portfolio once your salvation is secured.</p>
<p>My main contention is that <strong>Christians in the United States should lower their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor</strong>. In doing so, they will remain faithful to Scripture and discover a more satisfactory way of life.</p>
<h2 id="isnt-that-asceticism">Isn’t That Asceticism?</h2>
<p>At this point, some may claim that I am trying to advocate for a form of asceticism.</p>
<p>While my claim might appear that way when viewed through our culture’s thick lens of materialistic consumerism, I believe that I am actually advocating for a more satisfactory way of life.</p>
<p>God is revealed in Scripture to be the firmest advocate for human flourishing. That is, he desires what is truly best for his creation and his people. He created everything to be structurally good and is currently in the process of redeeming the universe from its directional digression away from its intended God-exalting purposes.</p>
<p>Things like hunger and poverty are on the chopping block in this redemptive mission. The standard to which everything is being drawn is not an eternally unsatisfying state of Spartan living and ascetic suffering. It is the eternally satisfying and rich state of glorifying God like creation was intended to.</p>
<p>I am advocating for a <em><strong>return</strong></em> to standards of living necessary for human flourishing, realizing that this standard will vary greatly from person to person and culture to culture.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> The problem is that <strong>what appears to be the standard of human flourishing to us is often quite damaging</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="false-wealth-the-dangers-of-materialism">False Wealth: The Dangers of Materialism</h2>
<p>The Bible pulls no punches in describing the dangers of a materialistic pursuit of wealth.</p>
<p>While money is nowhere declared to be intrinsically evil, Scripture makes it clear that we are all sin-stained creatures prone to greed and self-justification, and that an abundance of wealth and possessions makes it very hard to rise above our idolatrous inclinations and serve God well.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In addition, although it exceeds the scope of this essay, a strong argument can be made that our society’s pragmatic commitment to “getting ahead” is destroying our ability to experience genuine delight in the small things in life which do not increase our bottom line.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Despite our initial reactions, it appears as though what our culture is encouraging us to pursue is actually quite destructive to our ability to serve God well and genuinely enjoy life.</p>
<h2 id="downward-mobility">Downward Mobility</h2>
<p>While the culture around us is calling us towards a lifestyle of upward financial mobility, “the emphasis of the New Testament lies not on the acquisition side of things…but on sacrifice and divestiture”.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The incarnation of Jesus is a clear example of the kind of God we serve, one who emptied himself of the riches of heaven in order to take on human flesh and demonstrate a fiercely sacrificial obedience that took him all the way to the cross. Although there is a big gap between <em>kenosis</em> and a Christian’s obligation to give to the poor, it nonetheless serves as an example of the kind of living we are called to by the gospel.</p>
<p>At the very least, it is reasonable to say that the life of Jesus the Messiah was an atrocious failure when judged by our society’s standards of materialistic consumerism, and yet as Christians, we would all (presumably) confess that we are called to follow his example.</p>
<p>Again, keep in mind that we are not all called to live ascetically and to spurn the legitimate pleasures of this life. However, one would be hard pressed to find biblical support for our culture’s view of wealth and success.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-my-rights">What About My Rights?</h2>
<p>At this point, we are all tempted to rebuff and claim that we have every right to keep all of what we have “earned” and do as we wish with our excess funds.</p>
<p>However, the Bible presents us with the uncomfortable truth that <strong>everything we “own” is in fact owned by God and has been given to us to steward well</strong>.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>A prosperous Christian is not an intrinsic oxymoron, and there are examples in Scripture of wealthy people who seem to have genuinely loved God and served him well. However, there is no example of a person who selfishly viewed their possessions as their own, lived a lifestyle of extravagant wealth, and honored God by doing so.</p>
<p>Even more uncomfortable is the fact that, if God expects us to follow his example in our stewardship of his resources, then we are faced with a strong biblical mandate to give generously to the poor and fight for their justice.</p>
<h2 id="arent-the-poor-just-lazy">Aren’t the Poor Just Lazy?</h2>
<p>In my own experience, our culture’s stereotype of the poor consigns their condition to <em><strong>laziness</strong></em>. Evangelical Christians seem to use this stereotype to effectively avoid giving generously to the poor under the pretense of good stewardship and not wanting their giving to be taken advantage of by lazy individuals.</p>
<p>With regards to being taken advantage of, <strong>Christians should perhaps be the most willing people to be taken advantage of in their giving</strong>. After all, we frequently take advantage of God’s grace in our own lives, and if he modeled the same attitude to us that we display to the poor, we would be in a sorry state of affairs.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>However, <strong>the biblical picture of the poor emphasizes their destitution, need, lack of resources, and suffering under oppression.</strong><a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In contrast to our frequently apathetic response, God seems to have a bias to the poor. Karl Barth claimed that “<em><strong>God always takes his stand unconditionally and passionately on this side and this side alone: against the lofty and on behalf of the lowly; against those who enjoy right and privilege and on behalf of those who are denied it and deprived of it</strong></em>”.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Consider the biblical account.</p>
<ul>
<li>God intervened to save his people from the oppression and poverty they suffered in at the hands of the Egyptians.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn9">[9]</a></li>
<li>He made his frustration at his people’s improper treatment of the impoverished known through the prophets.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn10">[10]</a></li>
<li>Jesus the Messiah cited his own mission as one that was inextricably tied to the poor and oppressed.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn11">[11]</a></li>
<li>The final judgment will be executed (at least partially so) with regards to the treatment (or mistreatment) of the poor.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn12">[12]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture makes it abundantly clear that <strong>God’s heart is for the impoverished, destitute, and oppressed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As Christians, we must take seriously the words of our Savior that how we treat “the least of these” has serious import on how we treat and serve Christ himself.</p>
<p>We must take the whole witness of Scripture into account and realize that the God we serve and whose resources we steward shows special concern for the poor and oppressed.</p>
<p>We must be willing to acknowledge that our culture’s values of materialistic consumerism run against the grain of the gospel of “sacrifice and divestiture,” opening our eyes to the spiritual dangers of pursuing wealth and possessions.</p>
<p>Above all, perhaps, we must be willing to eschew the idolatry in our hearts and trust that our Heavenly Father knows what is best for us and desires to see us truly flourish in our sacrifice and generosity.</p>
<p>Then, and only then, will we be able to reduce our extravagant standards of living, give to the poor from our excess resources out of genuine generosity, and flourish as human beings by fulfilling our primary purpose: exalting and making much of our Maker.</p>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/give-thanks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not the most thankful person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am a follower of Jesus, and one of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning this semester is that &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;praise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thanksgiving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gratitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; are closely intertwined. Worship should involve the public proclamation of who God is and what He has done — including specific, personal declarations of thanksgiving for God&amp;rsquo;s grace and good gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you have a hard time cultivating this worshipful practice of gratitude, then allow me to suggest the following prayers from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bcponline.org/&#34;&gt;Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt; to help get us started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not the most thankful person.</p>
<p>However, I am a follower of Jesus, and one of the lessons I&rsquo;ve been learning this semester is that <u><strong>praise</strong></u>, <u><strong>thanksgiving</strong></u>, and <u><strong>gratitude</strong></u> are closely intertwined. Worship should involve the public proclamation of who God is and what He has done — including specific, personal declarations of thanksgiving for God&rsquo;s grace and good gifts.</p>
<p>If, like me, you have a hard time cultivating this worshipful practice of gratitude, then allow me to suggest the following prayers from the <a href="http://www.bcponline.org/">Book of Common Prayer</a> to help get us started.</p>
<p>The first one is the simplest: a prayer for <u><strong>Grace at Meals</strong></u>. Perhaps this is an easily-overlooked truth, but <u>we can ask God for grateful hearts</u>! That is, instead of merely asking him for things…for which we will hopefully then be grateful… we can ask him for help in <strong>becoming grateful people</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Give us grateful hearts, our Father, for all Your mercies, and make us mindful of the needs of others; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em>&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If you have time for more than just the 25-word prayer above, consider using the following prayers as a springboard for a time of gathering together as a family to give thanks to God. The General Thanksgiving is said by Anglicans during daily prayer throughout the year. Consider praying through this together as a family or group of friends.</p>
<p><u><strong>The General Thanksgiving:</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks for all your goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all whom you have made. We bless you for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; but above all for your immeasurable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory. And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies, that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our selves to your service, and by walking before you in holiness and righteousness all our days; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be honor and glory throughout all ages.</strong> <em><strong>Amen</strong></em>**.&rdquo;**</p>
<p>Finally, this Litany of Thanksgiving is a bit longer, but consider pausing after each segment to think on all the good gifts God gives to us in each area of life. If you, like me, have a hard time thinking of things to be thankful for, allow this time of prayer to jog your memory.</p>
<p><u><strong>A Litany of Thanksgiving:</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Let us give thanks to God our Father for all his gifts so freely bestowed upon us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the beauty and wonder of your creation, in earth and sky and sea.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For all that is gracious in the lives of men and women, revealing the image of Christ,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For our daily food and drink, our homes and families, and our friends,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For minds to think, and hearts to love, and hands to serve,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For health and strength to work, and leisure to rest and play,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For the brave and courageous, who are patient in suffering and faithful in adversity,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For all valiant seekers after truth, liberty, and justice,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For the communion of saints, in all times and places,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Above all, we give you thanks for the great mercies and promises given to us in Christ Jesus our Lord;</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>To him be praise and glory, with you, O Father, and the</strong> <strong>Holy Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></em></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>What are you thankful for?</p>

This year’s theme is “the theological interpretation of Scripture,” and the plenary speaker is Wheaton’s <a href="http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/T/Daniel-Treier">Daniel J.

Here’s the abstract:</p>
<div>This essay endeavors **to demonstrate the theological and exegetical legitimacy of viewing the atonement as the act in which the one God fulfills his creative purposes by bringing his uniqueness and simplicity to bear on our sinful, divisive condition through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah in order to save a people to robust unity with himself, each other, and the entire creation**. Given Adam Johnson’s thesis regarding God’s triune being-in-act, the fullness of the divine perfections, and the unity and diversity of Christ’s saving work, I draw upon the theology of Karl Barth and pertinent biblical data to frame a theory of the atonement based on the unity of God. Although the lack of ecclesiological unity is the impetus for my study, I choose primarily to emphasize the synthesis of God’s unity and the doctrine of reconciliation. That is, I focus on the theological explanations within the atonement of *why* the church is to be unified. However, after framing a unity-based theory of the atonement, I conclude this study by casting a vision for the ecclesiological implications of such a theory.
</div>![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dCQpiZIQL._SY344_PJlook-inside-v2,TopRight,1,0_SH20_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)If you can’t make it to my presentation, but you’re interested in the topic, check out [my previous series of posts ](https://joshuapsteele.com/reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/)and the [undergraduate thesis paper](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof.pdf) from which this conference paper is drawn. Also, consider buying the new paperback edition of [Adam J. Johnson’s *God’s Being in Reconciliation: The Theological Basis of the Unity and Diversity of the Atonement in the Theology of Karl Barth* (T&amp;T Clark Studies in Systematic Theology)](http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Being-Reconciliation-Theological-Systematic/dp/0567123456/). It’s much cheaper than the previous hardcover edition, and without his fresh insights into the doctrine of the atonement and Barthian theology, my paper would not have been possible.
<p>Finally, please attend the entire conference at Beeson if possible! <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/assets/1346/ets_southeast_2014_schedule_1_page.pdf">Here’s the full schedule</a>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Comprehension of the passage’s contemporaneous Greco-Roman epistolary landscape facilitates a knowledgeable analysis of its constituent parts.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn2"><span style="color: #000000;">[2]</span></a> Subsequently, the interpretive insights yielded by this examination facilitate an application of the letter to the contemporary Christian church.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Originally referring to “an oral communication sent by messenger,” the Hellenistic ἐπιστολή eventually encompassed a wide variety of documents – from commercial to legal, political to personal.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn3"><span style="color: #000000;">[3]</span></a> As Greidanus notes, the basic form of a Greco-Roman letter was tripartite, consisting of introduction/opening, body, and conclusion.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn4"><span style="color: #000000;">[4]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first section named the sender and addressee, often including a brief greeting and “a wish for good health.”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn5"><span style="color: #000000;">[5]</span></a> Most difficult to analyze formally, the body of Hellenistic letters was flexible enough to encompass content suited to each writing’s particular communicative act.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn6"><span style="color: #000000;">[6]</span></a> Finally, “greetings to persons other than the addressee, a final greeting or prayer sentence, and sometimes a date” comprised a typical conclusion to Greco-Roman epistles.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn7"><span style="color: #000000;">[7]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In contrast to literary essays and official documents of the day, written to general audiences apart from any relational context, Paul’s letters are more private and personal – exhibiting his pastoral concern for those to whom he was a representative of Christ and an elder in the faith.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn8"><span style="color: #000000;">[8]</span></a> Nevertheless, the Pauline epistles arguably exceed their contemporaneous correspondence in length, structure, and didactic intent.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn9"><span style="color: #000000;">[9]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Although Paul understandably followed the prevailing Greco-Roman form in his own letters, he nonetheless freely adapted the epistolary conventions of the day to suit his own purposes. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, as O’Brien notes, although “on occasion the more intimate letters of the Hellenistic period began with a thanksgiving to the gods for personal benefits received,” Paul expanded and developed the introductory thanksgiving/blessing section in his writings more often than any writer of his day, yielding a mix of Hellenistic form with Jewish and Christian content which is present in most of his letters.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn10"><span style="color: #000000;">[10]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly, Paul often modified the Greco-Roman form by including a concluding paranetic section of exhortation after the body of his letters.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn11"><span style="color: #000000;">[11]</span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000analysis-of-philemonspan"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Analysis of Philemon</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">An appreciation of Pauline epistolary form in Greco-Roman context yields important interpretive insights relating to both the parts and whole of the letter to Philemon, in which Paul displays remarkable tact as he advances his request for reconciliation between Philemon and Onesimus.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn12"><span style="color: #000000;">[12]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although lacking a definite section of paranesis, the epistle is composed of </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">an opening greeting (Philem 1-3), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">thanksgiving/prayer (4-7), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">body (8-22), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">and closing (23-25).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn13"><span style="color: #000000;">[13]</span></a> </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opening-greeting">Opening Greeting</h3>
<p>Of immediate note, Paul atypically refers to himself, in the midst of an otherwise standard greeting, not as an apostle (cf. Gal 1:1) or servant (cf. Rom 1:1; Phil 1:1), but as “a prisoner of Christ Jesus” (Philem 1; NRSV) – perhaps best explained by his desire throughout “to entreat rather than command” (cf. 8-9), but also to stress Onesimus’ usefulness to him in his captivity (cf. 11-13).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn14"><span style="color: #000000;">[14]</span></a></p>
<p>Sender (“Paul…and Timothy”; Philem 1a), and addressee (“Philemon…Apphia…Archippus…and the church in your house”; 1b-2) thus identified, Paul’s signature greeting of χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη (3) functions as a benedictional transition to a section of thanksgiving and prayer (4-7), which – as elsewhere in the Pauline corpus – introduces the letter’s main themes.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn15"><span style="color: #000000;">[15]</span></a></p>
<h3 id="thanksgivingprayer">Thanksgiving/Prayer</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As Bruce notes, “the ground of the thanksgiving and the substance of the prayer are closely related to the purpose of the letter.”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn16"><span style="color: #000000;">[16]</span></a> Paul gives thanks to God because of Philemon’s love, faith, and refreshment of “the hearts of the saints” (Philem 5, 7). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The content of Paul’s subsequent prayer, then, is that “the sharing of [Philemon’s] faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ” (6; ESV). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the phrase ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου is better translated as “the mutual belonging which is proper to your faith,” referring to, as Wright puts it, “the mutuality of the Christian life which, springing from common participation in the body of Christ, extends beyond mere common concern into actual exchange” – a mutual belonging which lies at the heart of Paul’s argument and requests throughout the epistle.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn17"><span style="color: #000000;">[17]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to introducing the key themes of love/heart (cf. ἀγάπη, 4,7,9; σπλάγχνα, 7,12,20) and mutual participation (cf. κοινωνόν, 17), the thanksgiving/prayer rhetorically establishes mutual goodwill as an exordium in which Paul emphasizes characteristics of Philemon to which he can then appeal.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn18"><span style="color: #000000;">[18]</span></a></span></p>
<h3 id="body">Body</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The main request of the letter’s body – of noteworthy length in its Greco-Roman context – is that <strong>Philemon should receive Onesimus just as he would receive Paul</strong> (17b).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn19"><span style="color: #000000;">[19]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A</span><span style="color: #000000;">lthough Paul makes use of every persuasive tactic at his disposal – including concession of apostolic authority (8; 19b), emotional appeal (9, 12), pun (11), and appeal to honor (14) – the main thrust of the argument depends on the “<strong>mutual belonging</strong>” (6) between Philemon and Onesimus now that the latter has become a Christian during Paul’s captivity (10).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn20"><span style="color: #000000;">[20]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Regardless of the exact nature of the past estrangement (about which Paul remains virtually silent), Philemon is urged to interpret the seemingly unfortunate state of affairs as an opportunity for eternal reconciliation (15-16), transferring any debts that Onesimus had incurred to Paul’s own account instead (18). In receiving back Onesimus, Paul’s “very heart” (12b), as “a beloved brother” (16), Philemon would continue his refreshment of the saints’ hearts (7) by refreshing Paul’s heart (20).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn21"><span style="color: #000000;">[21]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Here, then, is an analogous microcosm of the gospel itself – a fulfillment of Paul’s prayer for κοινωνία (6) and of the cruciform “ministry of reconciliation” of 2 Corinthians 5:16-21 and Colossians 1:24-29.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn22"><span style="color: #000000;">[22]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As Wright notes, just as in Christ God reconciles the entire world to himself (2 Cor 5:19), “God is in Paul reconciling Philemon and Onesimus” – who both owed a debt, so to speak, to the apostle for their conversion (Philem 10, 19b).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn23"><span style="color: #000000;">[23]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Confident of Philemon’s compliance with his reconciliatory request (21), Paul makes an additional request for lodging based on Paul’s hope for release from imprisonment and subsequent travel to Colossae to be present with his audience (22) – an epistolary structure known as the “apostolic parousia,” revealing Paul’s consideration of his writings as substitutes for his physical presence.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn24"><span style="color: #000000;">[24]</span></a> </span></p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, Paul reports the greetings of his gospel co-workers to Philemon (23-24), before reverting to the plural to include the other addressees (2) in his concluding benediction.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn25"><span style="color: #000000;">[25]</span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000applicationspan"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Application</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If the consensus interpretation that Onesimus is Philemon’s runaway slave is correct, then Deuteronomy 23:15-16 would seem to mandate that Paul <strong>not</strong> return the fugitive to his estranged master. <a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn26"><span style="color: #000000;">[26]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the reality of their mutual belonging in Christ compelled the apostle to facilitate the reconciliation now possible due to the Messiah’s death, burial, and resurrection (cf. 2 Cor 5:16-21). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, Lightfoot reveals a potential hurdle for modern readers of this ancient text when he notes that, <strong>though “the word ‘emancipation’ seems to be trembling on [Paul’s] lips…he does not once utter it.”</strong><a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn27"><span style="color: #000000;">[27]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first step in resolving this frustration involves the clear delineation between the context of slavery in which Onesimus lived, the transatlantic slave trade of the 16<sup>th</sup> through 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, and the modern day slavery of human trafficking and forced labor – for it is far too easy to conflate the three in indignation at Paul’s failure to request Onesimus’ freedom.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn28"><span style="color: #000000;">[28]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then, once the anachronism of expecting Paul to be a modern abolitionist is noted, it can be clearly seen that, as Bruce observes, <strong>though the epistle to Philemon “throws little light on Paul’s attitude to the institution of slavery,” it brings “the institution into an atmosphere where it could only wilt and die.</strong>”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn29"><span style="color: #000000;">[29]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After all, the same κοινωνία that enabled Philemon and Onesimus to be reconciled could not help but <strong>destroy</strong> the dynamics of slavery within the kingdom of God and body of Christ – where “there is no longer slave or free,” but all are “one in Christ Jesus” (Gal 3:28). </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to the world, Onesimus belonged to Philemon as a slave. According to Christ, they belonged to one another as brothers. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although here in Philemon, as elsewhere (cf. Col 3:22-4:1), Paul stops short of prohibiting slavery, it is clear that he understood the gospel of Jesus Christ inescapably to transform the divisive condition of humanity into a restored, eternal unity which transcended all temporal divisions (cf. 1 Cor 7:17-24; Col 3:11). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Paul’s tactful requests reveal that <strong>the bond between Philemon and Onesimus as brothers in the Lord</strong> (Philem 16) <strong>was far stronger than the social expectations of master and slave.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transcending the issue of slavery – yet simultaneously striking at its very core – Paul’s masterfully crafted epistle to Philemon reminds Christians in every age to apply consistently the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ to their relationships, in spite of individualism’s siren song, which might tempt them to manipulate and dominate instead of to mutually belong to one another in κοινωνία. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, readers of Paul’s letter to Philemon should follow his peace-making example by seeking to be ministers of reconciliation in their respective contexts – no matter how discordant or seemingly insignificant. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This brief letter thus coheres with the biblical theme of <strong>unity</strong>. Because God is one, his people are called to be one as well – a community of forgiven women and men, Jews and Gentiles, even slaves and masters who forgive each other’s debts and refresh each other’s hearts in the κοινωνία of their faith in Jesus their Messiah.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn30"><span style="color: #000000;">[30]</span></a></span></p>

Aune, *The New Testament in Its Literary Environment* (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1987) 211-2 and W.W. Klein, C.L. Blomberg and R.L. Hubbard, Jr., *Introduction to Biblical Interpretation*, Rev. Ed. (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2004) 431. This paper assumes the “consensus view” of the epistle’s provenance: namely, that the apostle Paul is addressing Philemon of Colossae regarding the estranged slave and now convert, Onesimus. The creative reconstruction of J. Knox, in which the extant epistle to Philemon is the “letter from Laodicea” (Col 4:16) which was written by Paul to Archippus (Philem 2), master of Onesimus, is here ignored; cf. J. Knox, *Philemon Among the Letters of Paul* (New York: Abingdon, 1959). For critical responses to Knox’s claims from the consensus view, see F.F. Bruce, *The Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Ephesians*, NICNT (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1984) 198-202; G.B.

The theme of mutual belonging is also expressed in the use of fellowship terminology in the epistle’s opening and conclusion: ἀδελφὸς (1), συνεργῷ (1), ἀδελφῇ (2), συστρατιώτῃ (2), συναιχμάλωτός (23), and συνεργοί (24).</span>

Rhetorical arguments noted by Aune, *New Testament*, 211. As Patzia notes, per rhetorical criticism the epistle can be structured into exordium (4-7), proof (8-16), and peroration (17-22).

The list of names at Philem 23-24 mirrors that found at Col 4:10-17, except for the omission of Jesus Justus (Col 4:11). Of note, though impossible to explain fully, is Epaphras’ designation as Paul’s “fellow prisoner” instead of a “fellow worker” as the others. However, Bruce notes that, as “the evangelist of the Lycus valley” in which Colossae was located (cf. Col 1:7; 4:12), Epaphras “would be personally known to Philemon,” and thus merit distinct mention. Bruce*, Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians*, 213-4.

It is likely that Philemon and Onesimus’ relationship was different than that between a normal master and slave. See T.G.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Black Friday proves that the progress of (post)modernity has failed to eradicate the ills of idolatry. Lest we denizens of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index&#34;&gt;“highly-developed” world &lt;/a&gt;think that we have left the primitive vestiges of wood, rock, and gold idolatry behind, our shopping patterns (and indeed our shopping identities as consumers) should remind us of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-25153350&#34;&gt;our consumerism’s dark side&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blackfridaydeathcount.com/&#34;&gt;lethal one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Although physical idols may not be as universally common today as they once were, invisible idols are as prevalent as ever, especially within the context of Western materialism, where money, possessions, influence, and power are the modern-day &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal&#34;&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Friday proves that the progress of (post)modernity has failed to eradicate the ills of idolatry. Lest we denizens of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index">“highly-developed” world </a>think that we have left the primitive vestiges of wood, rock, and gold idolatry behind, our shopping patterns (and indeed our shopping identities as consumers) should remind us of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-25153350">our consumerism’s dark side</a> — a <a href="http://blackfridaydeathcount.com/">lethal one</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve put in <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/">“Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof”:</a></p>
<p>“Although physical idols may not be as universally common today as they once were, invisible idols are as prevalent as ever, especially within the context of Western materialism, where money, possessions, influence, and power are the modern-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal">Baal</a>.”</p>
<p>If you DO happen to find yourself shopping on Black Friday, or really at any point during the upcoming shopping/holiday (an increasingly blurred line) season — allow me to recommend heartily the following book: <a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/the-economy-of-desire/283830">The Economy of Desire by Daniel M. Bell, Jr</a>. Here’s a poignant quote:</p>
<p><strong>“Capitalism distorts the creative power that is human desire by constantly creating new objects/idols for its fascination. It entices desire with an endless array of distractions. The enchantments of capitalist production are distractions precisely because they cannot satisfy our desire. And as far as capitalism is concerned, this is a good thing, for satisfied desire would spell an end to capitalism, which depends on the frenetic power of unquenched desire to drive its productive engines.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“In contrast, Christianity proclaims the good news that we can indeed find rest from the rat race that is the conflict of the capitalist market. Our desire finds its true home, its rest, its delight in communion with God. Desire’s true fascination is the radiance of love that is the glorious life of the blessed Trinity. For this reason, humanity might rightly be called <em>homo adorans</em> — worshiping beings. We are not beings caught in an endless cycle of trucking and bartering (<em>homo economicus</em>) but beings inclined to worship and enjoy the divine love that provides all we need. In other words, because the Lord is our shepherd, we shall not want (Ps. 23:1). We need not strive endlessly but can be content.” (168)</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t feel like braving the crowds, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Economy-Desire-The-Christianity-Capitalism/dp/0801035732">Bell’s book is available on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>November pierces with its bleak remembrance<br>
Of all the bitterness and waste of war.<br>
Our silence tries but fails to make a semblance<br>
Of that lost peace they thought worth fighting for.<br>
Our silence seeths instead with wraiths and whispers,<br>
And all the restless rumour of new wars,<br>
The shells are singing as we sing our vespers,<br>
No moment is unscarred, there is no pause,<br>
In every instant bloodied innocence<br>
Falls to the weary earth ,and whilst we stand<br>
Quiescence ends again in acquiescence,<br>
And Abel’s blood still cries in every land<br>
One silence only might redeem that blood<br>
Only the silence of a dying God.</p>
<h3 id="then-volf-on-violence">Then, Volf on violence:</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://downloads.unmultimedia.org/photo/medium/119/119163.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>“Religions advocate nonviolence in general, while at the same time finding ways to legitimate violence in specific situations; their representatives both preach against war and bless the weapons of their nation’s troops. <strong>And so the deep religious wisdom about nonviolence boils down to a principle that no self-respecting war-lord will deny, namely that you can be violent whenever you cannot be nonviolent, provided your goals are just (which they usually are for the simple reason that they are yours)</strong>. Religious dialogue or no religious dialogue, <strong>without the principled assertion that it <em>is never appropriate to use religion to give moral sanction to the use of violence</em>, religious images and religious leaders will continue to be exploited by politicians and generals engaged in violence.</strong>” (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exclusion-Embrace-Theological-Exploration-Reconciliation/dp/0687002826">Volf, E&amp;E, 286</a>).</p>
<h3 id="finally-volfs-conclusion-eampe-306">Finally, Volf’s conclusion (E&amp;E, 306):</h3>
<p>“<strong>It may be that consistent nonretaliation and nonviolence will be impossible in the world of violence</strong>. Tyrants may need to be taken down from their thrones and the madmen stopped from sowing desolation. […] It may also be that measure which involve preparation for the use of violent means will have to be taken to prevent tyrants and madmen from ascending to power in the first place or to keep the plethora of ordinary kinds of perpetrators that walk our streets from doing their violent work. It may be that in a world suffused with violence the issue is not simply “violence versus peace” but rather “what forms of violence could be tolerated to overcome a social ‘peace’ that coercively maintained itself through the condoned violence of injustice” (Suchocki 1995, 117). <strong>But if one decides to put on soldier’s gear instead of carrying one’s cross, one should not seek legitimation in the religion that worships the crucified Messiah. For there, the blessing is given not to the violent but to the meek (Matthew 5:5)</strong>.</p>
<p>“<strong>There are Christians who have a hard time resisting the temptation to seek religious legitimation for their (understandable) need to take up the sword. If they give in to this temptation, they should forego all attempts to exonerate their vision of Christian faith from complicity in fomenting violence</strong>. <strong>Of course, they can specify that religious symbols should be used to legitimate and inspire only <em>just</em> wars. But show me one warring party that does not think its wars is just!</strong> Simple logic tells us that at least half of them <em>must</em> be wrong. <strong>It could be, however, that simple logic does not apply the chaotic world of wars. Then all would be right, which is to say that all would be wrong, which is to say that terror would reign — in the name of gods who can no longer be distinguished from the devils.</strong>“</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past week has been a great one for slipshod attacks on pacifism. First, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firstthings.com/&#34;&gt;First Things&lt;/a&gt; (Stephen H. Webb) on October 15 —- &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/10/john-howard-yoder-and-the-violent-power-of-pacifism&#34;&gt;“John Howard Yoder and the Violent Power of Pacifism”&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis added below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nevertheless, pacifists, at least the ones I know, can be very enthusiastic about the rightness of their cause. Since &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;there is no rational justification for pacifism&lt;/span&gt;, defenders typically turn their rhetoric against their critics by casting them as stooges of the status quo. Since pacifists are against all forms of violence, anyone who disagrees with them must be in favor of violence. What this ploy misses is obvious. In a fallen world, not only is violence pervasive but it is also a toxin that, when legitimately used, can cure as well as kill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past week has been a great one for slipshod attacks on pacifism. First, from <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/">First Things</a> (Stephen H. Webb) on October 15 —- <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/10/john-howard-yoder-and-the-violent-power-of-pacifism">“John Howard Yoder and the Violent Power of Pacifism”</a> (emphasis added below):</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, pacifists, at least the ones I know, can be very enthusiastic about the rightness of their cause. Since <span style="text-decoration:underline;">there is no rational justification for pacifism</span>, defenders typically turn their rhetoric against their critics by casting them as stooges of the status quo. Since pacifists are against all forms of violence, anyone who disagrees with them must be in favor of violence. What this ploy misses is obvious. In a fallen world, not only is violence pervasive but it is also a toxin that, when legitimately used, can cure as well as kill.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“So we now know that [John Howard] Yoder was a violent man who believed so wholeheartedly in his own non-violent theology that he thought he could re-order human sexual relations. This single case does not invalidate pacifism, but it does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reveal just how delusional the pacifist goal can be. The pursuit of peace at all costs is just as dangerous as any other dream that cuts against the realities of human nature</span>.”</p>
<p>Exactly one week later, <a href="http://theresurgence.com/authors/mark-driscoll">Mark Driscoll</a> came out with this gem, <a href="http://theresurgence.com/2013/10/22/is-god-a-pacifist">“Is God a Pacifist?”</a>:</p>
<h2 id="jesus-is-not-a-pansy-or-a-pacifist"><strong>“JESUS IS NOT A PANSY OR A PACIFIST</strong></h2>
<p>“One of the defining attributes of God’s coming kingdom is <em>shalom</em>—perfect peace untainted by sin, violence, or bloodshed of any sort. Such a kingdom is only possible if an all-powerful, benevolent Authority vanquishes his enemies. In other words, the Prince of Peace is not a pacifist.</p>
<p>“God is the author of life and sovereign over death.</p>
<p>“Those who want to portray Jesus as a pansy or a pacifist are prone to be very selective in the parts of the Bible they quote. But the God of the bloody Old Testament is Jesus Christ. When he became a man, he walked the earth as a working-class carpenter. The European, long-haired, dress-wearing, hippie Jesus is a bad myth from a bad artist who mistook Jesus for a community college humanities professor. But if we want to learn all about Jesus we have to read all that the Bible says about him. Here’s how Jesus will appear one day:” [Proceeds to quote his favorite Bible passage, <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rev.%2014.14%E2%80%9320">Revelation 14:14-20</a>.]</p>
<p><strong>What about you? What’s your take on pacifism? And, if you’re going to critique it, please do a better job than Driscoll &amp; Co.!</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The written Word of God is, therefore, the authority for followers of the living Word of God precisely because of its providential role in the divine speech-act, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>3</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Practically, this providential role has worked itself out in various ways throughout the history of the Church, perhaps most notably through the development of canon in the patristic era. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Theologically, the authority of Scripture is inescapably <strong>trinitarian</strong> in nature and <strong>ecclesiological</strong> in implication.</span></p>
<p>(For an explanation of the Trinity, see my essay “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/">Trinity: What is it? (Why) Is it important?</a>“)</p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000what-scripture-is-for-christiansspan"><span style="color: #000000;">WHAT SCRIPTURE IS FOR CHRISTIANS</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For Christians, Scripture is the indispensable lens through which, with the Spirit’s illumination, we view Christ, who is himself the fullest lens through which we view the Godhead. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, the Bible is a vital link in the revelatory chain which includes Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and humanity. However, the Bible’s role <em>in</em> and <em>for</em> the Church is inescapably intertwined with (1) how the Bible came to be and (2) how it is properly to be accessed and interpreted.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000how-the-bible-came-to-bespan"><span style="color: #000000;">How the Bible Came to Be</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although the story of how the table of contents at the beginning of each Christian Bible came into existence is an old one, questions of <em>canon</em> in this sense did not arise immediately after Christ’s resurrection and ascension.<a href="#sdfootnote4sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The earliest Christians, persuaded that Jesus of Nazareth was the foretold Messiah of Israel, eagerly adopted the Hebrew Scriptures, or <em>Tanakh</em>, as their own Scripture. Apart from the Bible’s narrative of YHWH’s redemptive mission with his covenant people, the Christ-event (life, death, and resurrection) made little sense. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the other direction, however, the early Church believed that, as the fulfillment of the <em>Tanakh</em>, Christ himself was its true message. Put differently, the Hebrew Scriptures and the Son of God were considered reciprocally-interpretive, and this relationship was the first sense in which canon was considered as “the rule of truth”: the Christ-event and the Scriptures illuminate each other.<a href="#sdfootnote5sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>5</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The link between this earliest consideration of canon and the table-of-contents approach begins with the role proclamation and confession of the Son of God as the Bible’s true meaning – of the Gospel of Christ <em>according to the Scriptures</em> – have in creating the Church proper (cf. 1 Cor. 15:1-9).<a href="#sdfootnote6sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>6</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because Christians are primarily interested in bringing people to faith in the faithful God through Christ, the proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Word of God constitutes the Church as the divinely-ordained way in which faith is brought about (cf. Rom. 10:17). To use a spatial metaphor, this ecclesial “point” of proclamation becomes a “line” throughout history by <em>tradition</em> as “the act of passing down” and “the content of what is passed down.”<a href="#sdfootnote7sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Church is thus formed by proclamation/confession of Jesus the Messiah according to the Scriptures, and preserved by tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the second century C.E., Irenaeus of Lyons relied upon the connection between Scripture and apostolic tradition to refute Gnostic heresies which threatened to destabilize the Christian community by, among other things, insisting that Scripture could not be read at face value.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>8</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This connection was so strong that he referred to the “traditioned” teachings of the apostles as <em>in scripturis</em>, responding to those who accused these apostolic “Writings” of novel fiction by delineating the unity of Christian doctrine which had been passed down from the apostles (eyewitnesses of the Christ-event) to the Church through a clear line of bishops.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>9</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was of crucial importance to Irenaeus that Christian doctrine was (1) unified and (2) in direct continuity with the apostles’ teaching (and therefore with the proclamation of Christ and the Christologically-fulfilled expectations of the Hebrew Scriptures).<a href="#sdfootnote10sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the Gnostic controversies of the second century led to canonization in its second sense: the Church’s recognition/acknowledgment of writings which already had authority due to their coherence with the complex dialectic between Scripture, the Christ-event, the apostles, proclamation, and tradition.<a href="#sdfootnote11sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>11</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Canon’s final sense, as a list of included and excluded books which comprise the Bible, came into being in the fourth century. The Church’s recognition of already authoritative writings culminated in C.E. 367 with the <em>Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle</em> of Athanasius – the first canon list to include “all, and nothing but, all [sic] the books of our New Testament.”<a href="#sdfootnote12sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>12</sup></span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000scriptures-proper-interpretation-and-rolespan"><span style="color: #000000;">Scripture’s Proper Interpretation and Role</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In interacting with the Word of God, it is imperative that the people of God resist the impulse to jump behind the text – either to a Gnostic-inspired and disembodied spiritual narrative, or to historical criticism’s rationalistic insistence on verifiable facts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Properly handled, the Bible results in the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in order to produce faith in the faithful God.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Arguably, the best interpretive method accounts for both Christ as the fullest truth of Scripture and the varied ways in which the Bible has been used by God through his Spirit to accomplish his redemptive mission in manifold ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, in terms of my thesis above, the best biblical hermeneutic accounts for both the central locution (Christ) and the varied perlocutionary effects accomplished in/through the Church by the Spirit throughout history.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It does not leave Christ behind in its insistence on esoteric behind-the-text matters, nor does it refuse the Spirit its right to bring the written Word to bear on the interpreter’s present context in fresh ways. In this way, interpretation of the Bible leads to faith through the faithful proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Scriptures.</span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000scriptures-own-authorityspan"><span style="color: #000000;">SCRIPTURE’S OWN AUTHORITY</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned above, Scripture’s authority comes from its providential role in the speech-act of God, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, although the illocutionary acts of the Bible are an indispensable link in the revelatory chain, they do not comprise the entire chain. Any discussion of Scripture’s authority must, therefore, take place with its discursive context in mind, by including a discussion of the Christological locution and Spirit-empowered, ecclesiological perlocutionary effects of the divine speech-act.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Christologically, the illocutionary acts of the written Word of God bear witness to Christ the living Word as their central meaning: the ultimate locution of God. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Jesus himself never shied away from claiming that he was the fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures (Matt. 5:17; Lk. 24:25-27, 44). Indeed, he chastised the Jewish leaders for thoroughly studying the Scriptures, yet failing to see that the <em>Tanakh</em> bore witness to him (John 5:39-40)! </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, in Acts, Peter (3:11-26), Stephen (7:1-53), and Paul (13:16-41) all portray Christ as the fulfillment of YHWH’s previous interactions with Israel in the <em>Tanakh</em>. The written Word of God is authoritative in that it bears witness to the Living Word as the zenith of God’s redemptive revelation – the “image of the invisible God” in whom “the fulness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col. 1:15, 19, ESV).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When the Bible speaks of its own authority, it never does so apart from the life of the faithful, the Church. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The two favorite passages for the inspiration (and often, the inerrancy) of Scripture both refuse to reduce the Bible to a set of propositions to be debated within a correspondence theory of truth. The Scriptures were “breathed out by God,” not to be profitable for scientific analysis, but for “reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16, ESV). Furthermore, “men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit,” (2 Pet. 1:21, ESV) for the sake of the people of God, that they might know Christ (2 Pet. 1:12-21). Arguably, then, the ties between inspiration and sanctification are stronger than those between inspiration and certain common notions of inerrancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At this intersection between the inspired illocutionary acts of Scripture and their perlocutionary effects lies the Spirit of God, who empowers the “inscripturate” Word to become “incardiate,” or “taken to heart” by God’s people.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>13</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Pneumatologically, then, the Bible is able both to <em>be</em> and <em>become</em> the Word of God, as its written words are used in various ways by the Spirit throughout the ages to effect God’s mission of redemption <em>in</em> and <em>through</em> his people.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>14</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The christological, ecclesiological, and pneumatological elements of the divine speech-act thus enable the written Word continually to be an indispensable part of divine discourse, instead of a merely static word.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>15</sup></span></a></span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000conclusionspan"><span style="color: #000000;">CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout the ages, God has used his Word – living and written – to do everything from creating the world, to redeeming it; from calling a people, to establishing orthodoxy and orthopraxy in his Church; from inspiring reformation, to drawing people from every tribe, tongue, and nation to himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In order best to appropriate the written Word of God and submit to its continuing authority in their lives, the people of God should focus on proclaiming its central message as the Gospel of Jesus Christ and allowing the Holy Spirit to accomplish fresh perlocutionary effects <em>in</em> and <em>through</em> them as God’s redemptive mission moves toward its consummation – when the written Word of God will be in their hearts and the living Word of God in front of their faces, forever (Jer. 31:33-34; Rev. 21-22).</span></p>

<div id="sdfootnote1">[1](#sdfootnote1anc) Unless otherwise noted, I use the terms “Son of God,” “Jesus,” “Christ/Messiah,” and permutations thereof interchangeably. The same applies to “Scripture” and “Bible.”
</div><div id="sdfootnote2">[2](#sdfootnote2anc) I here adopt J.L. Austin’s speech-act theory, as put forth in How to Do Things with Words (2nd ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975). Briggs offers the following helpful summary: “Austin sought to distinguish between the act performed in saying something and the act performed by saying something, labeling these ‘illocutionary’ and ‘perlocutionary’ acts respectively.” See Richard S. Briggs, “Speech-Act Theory” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 763. I am also heavily indebted to Kevin J. Vanhoozer, “Word of God” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 850-4.
</div><div id="sdfootnote3">[3](#sdfootnote3anc) Theologically modifying Austin’s framework, the “divine speech-act” consists of God the Father (locutor), God the Son (locution), Scripture (illocutionary act), and God the Spirit (who fulfills the perlocutionary effects).

&lt;p&gt;Gombis hits the nail on the head here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The Gospel is more than a checklist, more than a five-minute “yes-or-no” conversation in which you can make a new Christian… its a narrative of cosmic significance. If God really is reconciling <em><strong>all things</strong></em> to himself in and through Jesus Christ, then everything we do and say, ESPECIALLY when we’re speaking of the Gospel, must change.</p>

<h2 id="jeremiah-2911">Jeremiah 29:11</h2>
<p>When I accepted the invitation to speak at my parents’ church, I immediately started thinking about what message I would deliver. I decided to give a message on something that is very important to me after my four years at <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/">Cedarville</a> and something I am very passionate about. I hope it will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">engaging</span>; I hope it will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make you think</span>; and I hope it will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bring glory to God</span>. If I can accomplish those three things, I will be satisfied.</p>
<p>The Scripture I chose is Jeremiah 29:11 and I’m guessing that most Christians could recite the verse from memory. If not, once you read it, you’ll probably remember or recognize it.</p>
<p><em><strong>“’For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.’”</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a familiar verse for a lot of Christians. My question today is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether it should be</span>.</p>
<p>This might seem like a strange question, but I think you’ll understand what I mean soon.</p>
<p>So why is this verse so familiar to us? Well, it’s used a lot. Are you nervous about future uncertainties? <em>Jeremiah 29:11</em>. Are you starting a new job?  <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Graduating from high school or college? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> That teenage girl had her boyfriend break up with her? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Car trouble that makes you late to work? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Lost your lucky pencil? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em></p>
<p>I hope you’re catching my sarcasm.</p>

And maybe you think I’m exaggerating. But I did a Google search for Jeremiah 29:11 and you can buy folders, clocks, plaques, keychains, mugs, pictures, bumper stickers, aprons, tote bags, iPhone cases, tshirts, pillows, bracelets, and even playing cards that have this verse on them. It might be rivaling the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023&amp;version=NET">23rd Psalm</a> after all that. And I know for a fact that it can be found on countless greeting cards whether they be sympathy, graduation, engagement, or congratulatory cards.</p>

</p>
<p>I saw a meme on the internet the other day. It was an image of the Bible, and the text said: “This is not a bag of trail mix. You can’t just pick out the pieces you like and ignore the rest.” I’m afraid that the widespread use of Jeremiah 29:11 demonstrates a bigger problem: we really are guilty of treating the Bible like a bag of trail mix. Jeremiah 29:11 is an M&amp;M that we pull out time and time again while we ignore all the peanuts and raisins and cashews and granola all around it.</p>
<p>Christians claim to have a high view of Scripture—that is, we say that the Bible is the authoritative, divinely inspired Word of God. We are quick to use it to tell the world what they’re doing wrong whether that be gay marriage or murder or how to raise children. We say that we live by what the Bible says, but I’m afraid that we’re often guilty of not even knowing what the Bible says. For me, the widespread use of Jeremiah 29:11 proves this.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, does anyone know what Jeremiah 29:10 says? No, because it’s a peanut. Jeremiah 29:12? Sorry, I don’t like raisins. But I am feeling uncertain about this new job/relationship/house/baby/friend/responsibility/accomplishment/etc., so I like to be told that God has good plans for me. I like to imagine him saying, “I know the plans I have for you…”</p>

</p>
<p>Okay, not to be harsh, but <strong>the Bible isn’t supposed to be about us.</strong> It’s actually not about us at all and it’s high time we quit acting like it’s a self-help book or a book full of timeless, ready-to-be-applied principles. It takes study—actual study—and hard work to read and understand the Bible and what God is saying to us. And if any book in the world is worthy of our time and energy and study, it’s got to be the Bible. But we so often pretend like it’s not.</p>
<p>Now, let me stop real quick and make sure you’re not hearing me say something I’m not. I’m not saying that the Bible isn’t applicable to you and your life. It is. <strong>But most of the Bible is not written to be timelessly applied to anyone, anywhere.</strong> The book of Romans was written to people who lived in Rome during the 1st century, not to people in America in 2013. Genesis was written for the Jewish people wandering in the desert and then entering the Holy Land during the time of Moses and Joshua, not for the people of your church. And Jeremiah, where this particular verse comes from? Well, we’ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>Now there are two doctrines that I want to highlight before I go any farther to make sure I express fully how Scripture should be applied to our lives. One is the doctrine of <strong>inspiration</strong> and the other is the doctrine of <strong>perspicuity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>First, the doctrine of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inspiration</span> means that <strong>the Bible is a divine product</strong>: it is inspired by God. God worked through the process of the composition and preservation of the books of the Bible. Therefore, yes, they were kind of written <em>for</em> us, but that’s different than them being written <em>to</em> us. God knew we would be reading Genesis someday, but Moses didn’t. And so the words that Moses wrote, although inspired by God, are not written to believers in the 21st century. When Paul wrote Romans, it never crossed his mind that Amy Chase from Ohio would be reading and studying them in 2013. So even though God inspired Paul to write and to write things that would remain applicable to people in 2013, Paul wasn’t intending to do that.</p>
<h2 id="perspicuity">Perspicuity</h2>
<p>The next doctrine is that of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perspicuity</span> of Scripture. Perspicuity is just a fancy word for “<strong>clear</strong>.” (Biblical scholars love fancy words for things.) Basically, the biblical text can be clearly understood by the ordinary reader. Someone can pick up the Bible and read it and understand it. It’s not gibberish. Anyone who can read can read the gospel accounts and understand that the story is about Jesus the Messiah, coming to earth, dying on a cross, and rising from the dead.</p>
<p>So, yes, you can pick up the Bible and “just read it.” And you do have, as a believer, the Holy Spirit helping you and guiding you. <strong>But the Holy Spirit is not, I believe, a big fan of laziness.</strong> He’s ready to help and guide you, but there are some things, like the geographic position of Jerusalem or the historical situation that caused Paul to write to the Romans, that he’s not going to be able to inspire in you. Well, he could, but that would be strange. Imagine if you just woke up tomorrow and could draw a detailed map of Israel, having never studied it. It’d be kind of like cheating, especially since that’s an assignment I had to do a lot of studying to be able to do. It’s a little like a parent helping a child with homework. If my mom had done my math homework for me, it wouldn’t have done me any good. But she did help me connect the dots and understand what I was supposed to be doing to get the right answer. <strong>The Holy Spirit will help you understand the Bible, but he’s not going to just read it for you and then inspire in your some kind of otherworldly, enlightened understanding.</strong> You will have to exert some effort. The knowledge is there for you, but you have to learn it.</p>
<p>At Cedarville, I majored in Bible and one of the very first things we were taught to do was to interpret Scripture well and then to be aware of when someone wasn’t. And, at Cedarville, when a chapel speaker or someone else mentions Jeremiah 29:11, all the Bible majors groan. It’s because Jeremiah 29:11 was the go-to verse that professors used to show us how the Bible is mishandled. Like I joked above, we decide that the “<em>you</em>” in “<em>I know the plans I have for you</em>” is the person starting the new job or the person who has lost their lucky pencil. Does God have good plans for your life? Yes, absolutely. But this isn’t the verse to prove it. And it certainly isn’t the verse to put on a graduation card. Let me explain why.</p>

<h2 id="inductive-bible-study-7-steps-to-study-the-bible">Inductive Bible Study: 7 Steps to Study the Bible</h2>
<p>But first, let me say a couple things about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">process</span> I’ll be using. At Cedarville, everyone takes certain classes and in one such class we were taught Bible study method, in particular, the <strong><em>inductive Bible study</em>.</strong> It’s a process by which anyone—and I mean anyone—can come to an educated understanding of what a passage is saying. I can do it, my grandma can do it, pastors can do it, and my 5th grade cousin can do it.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-survey-reading-and-historical-background">Step One: Survey Reading and Historical Background.</h3>
<p>Want to know what Jeremiah 29:11 means? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Read Jeremiah.</em></span> Okay, that’s a really long book. Sorry. Take that up with Jeremiah or God, I guess. Want to understand 1 Corinthians 13, the love chapter? Read 1 Corinthians. Want to understand John 3:16? Read John. Now, I’m not saying to study the whole thing to every minute detail, just read it. You can read it quickly even. Hey, college students know: a lot of assignments that are assigned to be “read” can be “skimmed.” I’m not suggesting we slack when reading the Bible, but you as long as you’re getting an idea of the book and what is being said, then you’re doing fine. Take a couple notes while you read: Who wrote the book? To whom? When? Why? What is the tone? What seems to be the big idea? What is each chapter about?</p>
<h3 id="step-two-unaided-observations">Step Two: Unaided Observations.</h3>
<p>Read the passage you want to study and understand. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Take notes.</span> When I did inductive studies for class, I had to do upwards of 10 observations per verse. To start, just aim for 3 or 4 per verse. They can be as simple as “Paul is making a statement here,” or “Jesus gives a command,” or “This verse switches from third person to first person.” They are called unaided because it’s just things you can come up with on your own. Things like repeated words and cause and effect statements are important to point out in your observations.</p>
<h3 id="step-three-interpretive-questions">Step Three: Interpretive Questions.</h3>
<p>After you make your observations, you’ll probably have some questions like, “Why did Paul say it that way?” or “What does this word mean?” If they’re questions you can’t answer on your own about your passage, that’s an interpretive question. Moving forward, it will be your goal to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">find an answer to your interpretive questions.</span> Try to come up with about five, but you can have as many as you want.</p>
<h3 id="step-four-word-studies">Step Four: Word Studies.</h3>
<p>All right, this is where it might seem to get complicated, but remember: I said that everyone could do this method. When we read the Bible, what we read is a translation. Although these translations are wonderful gifts for which we should be immensely grateful, they are also, unfortunately, a bit removed from the original. This means that some of the depth or nuance of the original might be lost without additional study.</p>
<p>Your Bible isn’t wrong, it’s just that the word in the original language might have more meaning than it’s possible for one English word to communicate. The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and the New Testament was originally written in Greek. So with word studies, we take an English word that is crucial in the verse and figure out what Hebrew or Greek word is was translated from.</p>
<h3 id="step-five-commentaries">Step Five: Commentaries.</h3>
<p>Say we’re working with John 3:16. What words might be counted as crucial? “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son…” There are lots of possibilities. It’s up to you to decide. Once you do that, there is a plethora of resources to help you see what the original word was and what meanings went along with it, and those resources are as close as your computer. The original word may encompass more or less than the English word. For example, using online resources, we see that the Greek word for “world” in John 3:16 is κοσμος with the meanings “the world, the universe, worldly affairs, the inhabitants of the world.” Sure, it might not be earth-shattering, but it’s an insight into the original language. And sometimes your findings may very well change how you read and understand a verse.</p>
<p>It’s just reading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what the experts have to say</span>. Commentaries will be the place where you’ll find answers to most of your interpretive questions. There are some very affordable commentaries out there and if you’re really looking to dig into a book of the Bible, buying one of two of them would be a great choice. Otherwise, there are a few online, but not the best ones. Libraries, Christian bookstores, and your church library would be good places to look. Not all commentaries are big, scary, technical books, and there are some that are very helpful and easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="step-six-synthesize">Step Six: Synthesize.</h3>
<p>Look at everything you’ve done and figure out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what it all means together.</span> We were taught to come up with a “Big Idea” which basically says what the passage is about and what it says about what it is about. And, we stay away from any <em>here</em> and <em>now</em> language (talking about what it means for me and you) and use only <em>then</em> and <em>there</em> language (what it meant back then). So what is John 3:16 about? God sending his Son. What does it say about God sending his Son? That he did it because he loved the world and that believing in the Son is the way to everlasting life.</p>
<h3 id="step-seven-application">Step Seven: Application.</h3>
<p>All right, until this point, we’ve avoided talking about ourselves. We’ve focused on what the author was saying to his intended audience. And, because of that, we should be able to figure out what the passage meant to the people it was written to originally. Now, to apply it, we need to figure out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what we have in common with that original audience.</span> If we are very similar, then we can apply it pretty directly, but if we are not, then the application will take a little more work and probably be a little more abstract.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="now-lets-go-back-to-my-beef-with-jeremiah-2911">Now, let’s go back to my beef with Jeremiah 29:11.</h2>
<p>Having done an inductive Bible study like I outlined for you, I’d like to explain why this is the verse my professors use to talk about misuse of the Bible. However, you don’t really have to go very far into the process. Let’s read <strong>Jeremiah 29:1-14:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The prophet Jeremiah sent a letter to the exiles Nebuchadnezzar had carried off from Jerusalem to Babylon. It was addressed to the elders who were left among the exiles, to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the other people who were exiled in Babylon. He sent it after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the palace officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had been exiled from Jerusalem. He sent it with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah. King Zedekiah of Judah had sent these men to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. The letter said:</p>
<p>‘The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says to all those he sent into exile to Babylon from Jerusalem, “Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what they produce. Marry and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons and allow your daughters get married so that they too can have sons and daughters. Grow in number; do not dwindle away. Work to see that the city where I sent you as exiles enjoys peace and prosperity. Pray to the Lord for it. For as it prospers you will prosper.”</p>
<p>‘For the Lord God of Israel who rules over all says, “Do not let the prophets or those among you who claim to be able to predict the future by divination deceive you. And do not pay any attention to the dreams that you are encouraging them to dream. They are prophesying lies to you and claiming my authority to do so. But I did not send them. I, the Lord, affirm it!”</p>
<p>‘For the Lord says, “Only when the seventy years of Babylonian rule are over will I again take up consideration for you. Then I will fulfill my gracious promise to you and restore you to your homeland. For I know what I have planned for you,” says the Lord. “I have plans to prosper you, not to harm you. I have plans to give you a future filled with hope. When you call out to me and come to me in prayer, I will hear your prayers. When you seek me in prayer and worship, you will find me available to you. If you seek me with all your heart and soul, I will make myself available to you,” says the Lord. “Then I will reverse your plight and will regather you from all the nations and all the places where I have exiled you,” says the Lord. “I will bring you back to the place from which I exiled you.”’”</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<p><strong>These people weren’t graduating from high school or starting a new job.</strong> Their country had been violently conquered by an outside force, the Temple destroyed, and they were carried off to a foreign country. They were questioning the faithfulness of God, feeling forsaken. Forsaken by God who had promised them the land they had been taken from, the land they had watched being destroyed. And now Jeremiah writes them a letter telling them that God wants them to know that <strong>they’ll be there a while</strong>.</p>
<p>But, because he loves them, God gives them a glimmer of <strong>hope</strong>: this is just a pause in the plans. He still plans to do good to them. But this is a punishment for their disobedience and they will pay the full cost. It’s hope in the midst of one of—if not the—darkest times in Israel’s history. So when we put Jeremiah 29:11 on a wedding card… Well, something just seems a little off to me.</p>
<p>Now, if you are a position where you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suffering</span>, where you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">questioning</span> the faithfulness of God, where you are in a situation comparable to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the exile of the Jewish people</span>, then this verse can be applied more directly to your life (though we still have to deal with the fact that you are not a member of the Jewish nation).</p>
<p><strong>But we really need to stop using it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lightly</span>.</strong> Because when Jeremiah wrote these words to the Jewish people in Babylon, he was not writing them lightly but probably with tears in his eyes. God did not speak them lightly but rather as the eternal Yahweh who will keep his word even in light of the faithlessness of his people.</p>
<p><strong>And if we are going to be the light of the world, then we need to make sure we are treating the Bible the way it deserves to be treated so that we can truly tell the world what God wants them to hear, and not just read them some verse that we don’t fully understand ourselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s be wary of treating the Bible like trail mix because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the world doesn’t need trail mix</span>, it needs to see the God of the Bible in all his power and love and hope.</strong></p>

<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>As the climactic renewal and enumeration of Yahweh’s covenant with Israel, Deuteronomy contains at its core a cross between an ancient Near Eastern law code and treaty.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Within this structure, the laws and treaty stipulations – general (5:1-11:32) and specific (12:1-26:19) – are given pride of place. After the setting and introduction to the covenant (4:44-49), Moses<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> begins his second sermon (5:1-28:69) with an interpretive restatement of the Decalogue (5:6-21), couched within an extended reflection on the initial law-giving at Horeb and Moses’ role as mediator (5:1-33).</p>
<p>In the passage at hand (6:1-15), he then transitions to the remainder of the general stipulations (6:1-11:32) with an introductory exhortation (6:1-3), a distillation of the covenant principles (6:4-5), and an extension of these principles to future generations and society (6:6-9), concluding with a warning against forgetfulness and idolatry as the Israelites soon enter the land of Canaan (6:10-15). <em><strong>In remembrance of and in response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, Israel must love Yahweh absolutely and exclusively by internalizing, embodying, and teaching covenant faithfulness as they inherit the blessings of the promised land.</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="introductory-exhortation-61-3">INTRODUCTORY EXHORTATION: 6:1-3</h1>
<p>Moses begins this passage with an exhortation to keep the general stipulations of the covenant to be discussed in Deuteronomy 6-11. In response to Yahweh’s command (recounted at 5:31), Moses teaches the people the “commandments, statutes, and ordinances” (5:31, 6:1; referring to the covenant stipulations)<sup> <a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></sup> so that they will “carry them out in the land” (5:31, 6:1).</p>
<p>This transmission of the covenant stipulations from Yahweh to Moses to the Israelites was not meant to achieve a merely epistemic result, but also an ontic one. That is, Moses was not merely teaching them the stipulations so that they would merely know (and do) the right things, but so that they would be the right kind of people, internalizing and embodying the stipulations as they entered the promised land of Canaan. The intended result of the commandments, statutes, and ordinances was holistic covenant faithfulness.</p>
<p>At the heart of the appropriate epistemic and ontic response to the covenant stipulations was the proper fear of Yahweh their God (6:2a), which was to result in a continual obedience for generations upon generations (6:2b),<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> reflecting the importance of teaching covenant faithfulness to their children.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> As the injunctions to “pay attention” and “be careful” (6:3a) indicate, this obedience was also to be careful and deliberate.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> The promised results of such continual and careful covenant faithfulness are long life (6:2c) and many descendants (6:2b, 3a) in the bountiful promised land (6:1b, 3b), recalling Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to fulfill his promises of land and offspring to Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<h1 id="distillation-of-the-covenant-principles-64-5">DISTILLATION OF THE COVENANT PRINCIPLES: 6:4-5</h1>
<p>Following the brief introduction to the general stipulations (6:1-3), Moses distills the Decalogue, itself an encapsulation of the entire covenant, into just sixteen Hebrew words, providing “the expression of the essence of all God’s person and purposes” (6:4-5).<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Named after the first Hebrew word in 6:4 (<em>shéma’</em>, “hear, pay attention”), the “Great Shema” has long been regarded as central to Deuteronomy and to Israelite theology and praxis.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> However, because of its brevity, the translation of the Shema (particularly 6:4) into English has been the topic of considerable debate. Although the initial imperative and vocative (“pay attention, Israel”) are clear enough, translating the remaining four terms (“Yahweh, our God, Yahweh, one”) into English involves making a decision on the placement of the copulative and the precise translation of <em>ekhad</em> as “one” or “alone.”<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>On balance, given the statement’s quasi-poetic brevity, it seems best to render 6:4: “Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is one.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> This translation allows for a mediating position between Block’s arguments for rendering <em>ekhad</em> as “alone,” emphasizing God’s uniqueness, and Janzen’s arguments for God’s oneness as internal consistency and faithfulness to Israel.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Compared to the gamut of Canaanite and other ancient Near Eastern deities, Yahweh was indeed unique,<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> primarily because of his faithfulness to Israel from the patriarchs (6:3b, 10a), through the exodus (6:12), and into the imminent conquest of Canaan (6:1b, 3, 10-11). That “Yahweh is one” is not so much an ontological statement as it is a historical reflection<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> in remembrance of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to his covenant people.</p>
<p>Therefore, in response to this unique faithfulness, Israel must love Yahweh absolutely (6:5), as seen by the concentric use of <em>lebab</em> (“heart,” the inner being, including emotion and intellect), <em>nephesh</em> (“soul,” the entire being, including desires), and <em>me’od</em> (“strength,” the physical being, including economic and social resources).<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> This is the only proper response to the God who is truly <em>ekhad</em> (6:4),<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> comprising the essential principle upon which the entire covenant rested.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> Related to the previously mentioned fear of Yahweh and obedience to the covenant stipulations (6:1-3), loving Yahweh involves the epistemic/ontic response of internalizing (with the <em>lebab</em> and <em>nephesh</em>) and embodying (through the <em>me’od</em>) covenant faithfulness.</p>
<h1 id="extension-to-family-and-society--66-9">EXTENSION TO FAMILY AND SOCIETY – 6:6-9</h1>
<p>The proper love of Yahweh is absolute, permeating not only the entire person (6:5), but also all of life (6:6-9),<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> including the family unit (6:7) and society (6:8-9). Beginning again with the concept of epistemic internalization, Moses commands the Israelites to keep “these words” (referring to the entire covenant through the Shema)<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> on their hearts/minds (6:6).</p>
<p>This internalization of the covenant through constant reflection is then to be extended by teaching covenant faithfulness to future generations (6:7a), here described with an unusual verb (<em>shanan</em>) which evokes the imagery of engraving a message into stone.<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a> Just as Moses is teaching the Israelites the covenant stipulations, they must teach these things to their children through constant repetition and discussion of the faithful covenant lifestyle within the household, reflected through the double merism of 6:7b (sitting/walking; lying down/getting up).<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Finally, this commitment to covenant faithfulness was to transcend the household and permeate the entire society (6:8-9). Although the instructions here (to “tie,” “fasten,” and “inscribe” the covenant stipulations on the forearm, forehead, and door frames, respectively) were taken literally in later Jewish tradition,<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> they were probably meant to be interpreted metaphorically.<a href="#_ftn23">[23]</a> In this case, 6:8 refers to the embodiment of the covenant principles in everyday life, identifying each individual Israelite as a faithful covenant member.<a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a></p>
<p>However, in 6:9 the exhortation to covenant faithfulness is then expanded to the household and the community as “these words” (6:6) are inscribed “on the doorframes of your houses and gates” (6:9).<a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> In response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, the Israelites are to love him absolutely by internalizing (6:6), embodying (6:8-9), and teaching (6:7) covenant faithfulness.</p>

<h1 id="warning-against-forgetful-idolatry-610-15">WARNING AGAINST FORGETFUL IDOLATRY: 6:10-15</h1>
<p>However, the proper love of Yahweh is also exclusive, for his uniqueness demands that he be worshipped alone. After distilling the covenant (6:4-5) and extending its essential claim to the family and society (6:6-9), Moses exhorts his audience to eschew all forms of forgetful idolatry. Instead, the Israelites are to love Yahweh exclusively as they inherit the blessings of the promised land, in remembrance of and in response to his unique faithfulness (6:10-15).</p>
<p>The historical context of this passage is especially important for the interpretation of 6:10-11. Moses reminds the Israelites of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness by linking the divine promises of land to the patriarchs with the fulfillment of those promises in the imminent conquest and occupation of Canaan.<a href="#_ftn26">[26]</a> The concrete description of the promised land in 6:10b-11 was designed to remind the audience that it was a blessing and a gift from Yahweh in faithful fulfillment of his kingly duties.<a href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> The warning in 6:12 to “be careful” reveals Moses’ anxiety that the sudden affluence the Israelites would experience in Canaan might lead them to forget their uniquely faithful God, who had redeemed them from the oppressive hand of the Egyptians and provided for them throughout the wilderness wanderings.<a href="#_ftn28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Therefore, 6:13 contains an intensely covenantal threefold call to the exclusive love of Yahweh alone.<a href="#_ftn29">[29]</a> As part of the proper response to Yahweh’s oneness (6:4), the Israelites are to fear only Yahweh, serve only Yahweh, and swear only by Yahweh’s name.<a href="#_ftn30">[30]</a> Moses then intensifies the warning even further in 6:14-15 with a rephrasing of the first two commandments (Deut 5:7-10).<a href="#_ftn31">[31]</a> On the basis of Yahweh’s righteous jealousy and the promised punishment of exile (5:9; 6:15; cf. 28:63; Lev 26:43), the Israelites are to love Yahweh exclusively by completely eschewing all forms of foreign idolatry (6:14).<a href="#_ftn32">[32]</a></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>As an introduction to the main exposition of the general covenant stipulations (Deut 6-11), Moses begins with an exhortation, calling the Israelites to the proper internalized and embodied response to Yahweh’s commands, statutes, and ordinances: covenant faithfulness as they enter the promised land (6:1-3). Then, he presents the distilled essence of the covenant principles in 6:4-5: the demand for the absolute love of Yahweh on the basis of his unique faithfulness.</p>
<p>This essential covenant claim is then extended to the family unit and society in 6:6-9 as the Israelites are commanded to internalize, embody, and teach covenant faithfulness to future generations.</p>
<p>Finally, in 6:10-15, in anticipation of the conquest of Canaan as a revelation of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to the patriarchs and the nation, the people are sternly warned to eschew all forms of forgetful idolatry and instead to worship Yahweh alone.</p>
<p>Therefore, taken as a whole, Deuteronomy 6:1-15 was written to teach its original audience that, <em>in remembrance of and in response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, they were to love Yahweh absolutely and exclusively by internalizing, embodying, and teaching covenant faithfulness as they inherited the blessings of the promised land.</em></p>

Gordon J. Wenham proposes this structural approach to the Deuteronomic covenant in <em>A Guide to the Pentateuch</em> (vol. 1 of <em>Exploring the Old Testament</em>; Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 2002), 125. The similarities between Deuteronomy and ANE suzerain-vassal treaties are also noted by Eugene E. Carpenter in “Deuteronomy,” in <em>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy</em> (ed. John H.

<p><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> Throughout this study, I assume Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy. Furthermore, I assume that the passage at hand was originally composed just prior to Moses’ death and the subsequent conquest of Canaan. With regards to setting, Carpenter places Moses in the plains of Moab on the eastern side of the Jordan River in either 1406 or 1229 B.C. The earliest extra-biblical account of the Israelites in Canaan, a stele erected by Merneptah in western Thebes, mentions them already in the land in 1209 B.C (Cf. Carpenter, 420).</p>

      <title>You&#39;re Reading Romans 13 Wrong! Here&#39;s How to Read It Correctly</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.</p>
<p>Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.</p>
<p>An adequate case study of this phenomenon is the interpretation(s) of Romans 13:1-7, a text that has been used to justify everything from utter obedience to totalitarian regimes to unquestioning support of harsh anti-immigration laws. These seven verses from Paul’s epistle to the Romans have been grossly abused at numerous points since their original composition.</p>
<p>In Romans 13:1-7, Paul exhorts the Roman believers to apply his previous commands toward love (12:9), harmony (12:16), and peace (12:18) in the context of obedience to government (13:1-5) and the payment of taxes (13:6-7).</p>
<p>Far from being a comprehensive condensation of the apostle’s beliefs regarding any and all governments past and present, this passage is a specific and historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, discouraging them from political unrest, disobedience, and rebellion in order to protect their testimony and the effectiveness of the Roman church in the gospel mission.</p>
<p>This thesis will be “proven” by appealing to the historical context of the original audience and the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10 in which this passage rests.</p>

Looking for a great commentary on Romans? <a href="https://amzn.to/3S1KBB1">Read this one by Doug Moo</a> [affiliate link]!)</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2>
<p>When Romans 13:1-7 is read as if it was written in a modern North American context, it seems as though Paul is appealing to the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations to remind us of the divinely-appointed nature of our free-market economy and federal constitutional republic.</p>
<p>All of this is supposedly done to prompt us toward active participation in our civil government and unquestioning obedience to all of its laws. After all, these verses come up in discussions of Christian political involvement, debates on just war theory vs. pacifism, and diatribes against illegal immigrants and those who desire to aid them.</p>
<p>However, using these seven verses as a packet theology of church and state is problematic, even within the Pauline corpus alone. The same man who wrote Romans 13 also frequently took up themes in his writings that would challenge the power and authority of the Roman Empire, for the declaration that Jesus is Lord contains the implicit declaration that Caesar is not. Our understanding of these seven verses must, therefore, be able to mesh with other passages (such as Phil 2:6-11; 3:20-21; 1 Thess 1:9-10; and 4:13-5:11) and their implications on relations between church and state.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Many commentators in recent years have recognized the importance of interpreting this passage in light of its historical context at the time of its composition (c. A.D. 57<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>), instead of assuming that these verses are Paul’s fundamental views on how church and state should relate to each other.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Knowledge of the situation facing the Roman Christians in A.D. 57 is crucial to the interpretation of this text. Emperor Claudius had expulsed Jews from the city of Rome in A.D. 49, removing Jewish believers from the Roman church and therefore leaving only Gentile Christians behind in their stead.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>However, Claudius was killed by his wife Agrippina in A.D. 54, and her son Nero advanced to the throne that same year, immediately allowing the Jews to return to the city. When Romans was written by Paul in A.D. 57, the Empire enjoyed a period of peace that looked quite different from the chaos that would characterize the later years of Nero’s reign.</p>
<p>Guided by his advisor Seneca, Nero made promises of a different and better peace than the <em>pax romana</em> of Augustus. He promised true peace, characterized by restraint and the peaceful resistance to using force in order to govern. While these promises were dashed beginning in A.D. 59, with Nero’s matricide, the loss of his advisors, and the beginning of his persecution of Christians, it is crucial to remember that Paul wrote Romans during the period of hopeful peace from A.D. 54-59.</p>
<p>Romans 13:1-7 should not, therefore, be interpreted as if it were written to Roman believers in the later years of Nero’s reign, when persecution and oppression were rampant, for this would unduly strengthen Paul’s “pro-Empire” sentiments here.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>With this background information, it is easy to see why Paul here gives advice to his readers, a cosmopolitan church in Rome struggling to figure out Jew-Gentile dynamics in the early years of Nero’s reign, so as to prevent them from drawing negative attention to themselves and damaging the effectiveness of the gospel mission.</p>
<p>Although things were presumably “going well,” as mentioned above, Paul knew full well that things could get tense for the Roman believers very quickly. Despite the period of relative peace from A.D. 54-59, tensions were rising in Rome in A.D. 57-58 regarding the particularly nasty practice of indirect taxation. Furthermore, the Jewish believers who had returned to the city in A.D. 54 might not have been on the best terms with neither the Roman authorities nor the Gentile believers. Much of what Paul has to say in this epistle speaks to this issue: the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians within the Roman context.</p>
<p>It is not, therefore, unreasonable to assume that this played a role in the social tension Paul here addresses in Romans 13:1-7. Furthermore, revolutionary sentiments were in vogue at this time among the Jews in Palestine, and Paul was perhaps worried that the fervor would spread to the Roman church and quickly create some serious problems given the tensions within the church and its social context.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Positively, then, when Romans was written, the original audience enjoyed a period of relative peace and stability before the chaotic upheaval that would take place in A.D. 59.</p>
<p>Negatively, there was still quite a bit of tension within and around the Roman church which had the potential to divide the church and get the Christians in serious trouble with Roman authorities if rebellion became the rallying cry for the followers of Jesus, assured of the lordship of their King and the reality of his kingdom.</p>
<p>It is therefore a mistake to read Romans 13:1-7 as a justification of the sins of the state, as if this passage gave a carte blanche to the atrocities to be committed in the later years of Nero’s reign. Paul was capable of saying negative things about pagan governments when they were going awry<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>, but he nevertheless appealed to God’s sovereignty over human governments in order to prevent the tense situation of his audience from erupting into a social upheaval that would wreck the church’s testimony and hinder the gospel mission in the city of Rome and the empire over which that city ruled.</p>
<p>His audience then (and readers of the epistle today) would not, therefore, be expected to never challenge the government or abstain from promoting or participating in its practices, as Romans 13:1-7 has often been used to argue. Instead, they were (and are) to wisely interact with human governments, not seeking to cause any trouble in society that would damage their testimony, but not hesitating to stand firm in the cause of Christ their King when human governments do things contrary to the kingdom of God.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Wright pulls these themes together quite well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]recisely because of all the counter-imperial hints Paul has given not only in this letter and elsewhere but indeed by his entire gospel, it is vital that he steer Christians away from the assumption that loyalty to Jesus would mean the kind of civil disobedience and revolution that merely reshuffles the political cards into a different order. […] The main thing Paul wants to emphasize is that, <em>even though Christians are servants of the Messiah, the true lord, this does not give them carte blanche to ignore the temporary subordinates whose appointed task, whether (like Cyrus) they know it or not, is to bring at least a measure of God’s order and justice to the world. The church must live as a sign of the kingdom yet to come, but since that kingdom is characterized by justice, peace, and joy in the Spirit [14.17], it cannot be inaugurated in the present by violence and hatred</em>.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sentiments and those outlined above will now be augmented by a brief examination of Roman 13:1-7 within the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<h2 id="scriptural-context-romans-129-1310">Scriptural Context: Romans 12:9-13:10</h2>
<p>The passage at hand only makes sense within the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10. Although Paul undoubtedly changes topics at 13:1, the thematic links between 13:1-7 and 12:9-21 are difficult to ignore. KakoV (“evil”) and agaqoV (“good”) occur in Rom 12:17, 21 and 13:3-4. Orgh (“wrath”) is mentioned in 12:19 and 13:4, 5. Also, conceptually, vengeance is mentioned in 12:19 and 13:4.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> It is therefore quite reasonable to see a connection between 13:1-7 and 12:9-21.</p>
<p>The links between this passage and the one immediately preceding it, however, should not overshadow the importance of the thematic verses earlier in 12:1-2. There Paul effectively redefines the people of God as no longer just Jews, but Gentiles as well. This is a common enough theme throughout the entire epistle and in almost all of Paul’s writings,<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> but in Romans 12:1-15:13, it is of particular importance.</p>
<p>Having spent the first eleven chapters of the epistle explaining the identity of the people of God as a mix of Jews and Gentiles and defending the covenant loyalty of God in the process, Paul now devotes chapters 12-15 to redefining the “rule of life” of the people of God.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> In 12:9-21, Paul proclaims “love as the fundamental moral imperative in human relationships,”<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> urging his readers to pursue harmony (12:16) and peace (12:18). He then redefines in 13:1-7 how the people of God in the church at Rome should relate to the power structures of the society in which they dwell.</p>
<p>Romans 12:9-21 is one of the most loosely-constructed passages in the entire epistle. This means that it would take quite a bit of time and space to comprehensively analyze the syntax and detailed meaning of the passage. However, some general observations are in order.</p>
<p>The thematic verse of this paragraph is 12:9 (NET)<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>, “Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.” From there, Paul emphasizes the important manifestations of genuine love: mutual devotion and eagerness in showing honor (12:10), enthusiastic spiritual service (12:11), hopeful joy and persistent prayer in the face of suffering (12:12), and hospitably meeting the needs of the saints (12:13). Harmony is commanded within and outside the church, extending even to persecutors (12:14, 16). Instead of responding in kind to their persecutors and therefore being “overcome by evil” (12:21a), Paul urges them to live peaceably (12:17-18), forbidding them from taking vengeance into their own hands (12:19). Instead, the Roman believers are to “overcome evil with good” (12:21b), and this is illustrated in 12:20, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will be heaping burning coals on his head.”</p>
<p>At this point after 12:21, most modern English readers of Scripture are confronted by a large “13” and perhaps a subject heading, such as “Submission to Civil Government.” The advantages of verse and chapter divisions for Bible reading and study are well-known. However, the chapter division here has had detrimental effects on the exegesis of this passage.</p>
<p>Although seemingly a very minor change, it puts undue emphasis on Paul’s supposed change of topic, prompting the interpretations of many that this is Paul’s comprehensive theology of church and state relations, ignoring the passage’s context and the historical situation of the original audience, who would have heard this epistle read without the explanation of a chapter division or sub-heading.</p>
<p>Romans 13:1-7 is most naturally read as the unpacking of the principles of 12:9-21, in the context of how Christians in Rome should behave in relation to the powers that governed the society in which they dwelt. It answers the implied question (after reading 12:9-21): “Paul, if we are to do these things (love genuinely, pursue harmony and peace, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good, etc.), how should this apply in regards to our relationship with the rulers of our city and empire?”</p>
<p>The specific rules that governed the theocracy of ancient Israel no longer held sway for the international and multi-ethnic body of Christ. As noted above, the situation in Rome, although relatively peaceful, was still quite tense within and outside of the church. Jews and Gentiles were struggling to remain unified in the Messiah in spite of their cultural differences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jews in Rome, only recently allowed back into the city, may have been culturally stigmatized as superstitious and unwanted. Tensions were building because of indirect taxation. And Jews in Palestine were growing more and more rebellious.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>It is not therefore hard to imagine why Paul felt the pastoral need to apply the principles of 12:9-21 to the realm of society and government. A “perfect storm” was brewing underneath the surface, one that could put the Christians in Rome at odds with not only each other but with the Roman Empire itself very quickly if the believers there tended towards promoting social unrest, perhaps due to an over-realized eschatology that would want to usher in the kingdom of God by overthrowing Roman rule. If the Christians in Rome made a wrong move, evil could quickly overcome them.</p>
<p>While a full analysis of the argument of the text at hand is beyond the scope of this essay, a brief trace of the thought-flow of Romans 13:1-7 will aid in comprehension of its contextually-appropriate meaning. The general command to submit to the authorities is found in 13:1a, and is reiterated in 13:5.</p>
<p>The first reason for this submission is that the authorities have been appointed by God (13:1b). Logically, then, those who oppose the authorities oppose “the ordinance of God” (13:2b). The consequence of disobeying the general command is therefore God’s judgment<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> (13:2b).</p>
<p>The second reason for submission is that the rulers are servants of God to commend good and to administer retribution to evil, although these two verses can also be seen as support for the claim that those who resist the authorities can expect judgment on earth<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> (13:3-4).</p>
<p>Paul then restates the main thesis of 13:1-4 in 13:5, urging his readers to submit because of “wrath” (they would face judgment if disobedient) and “conscience” (they would be opposing God’s ordinance). He then closes this paragraph with an appeal to the readers’ current practice of paying taxes in submission to the government (13:6), urging them therefore to continue respectfully in what they have already been doing (13:7).<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>When unhindered by the chapter division, it is easy to see how Romans 13:1-7 relates to 12:9-21. The genuine love commanded in 12:9a would be quite hard to apply to the impersonal institution of the Roman government. On the other hand, it would have been quite easy for the rebellious attitudes of the Jews in Palestine to seep into the Roman context, prompting the Roman Christians to rebel and try and institute the kingdom of God in opposition to Roman rule.</p>
<p>Paul steps in and applies the principles of non-violence, non-retribution, and enemy love (12:14, 17, 18-20) to the context of government and society. In order to “overcome evil with good” (12:21) when it came to the Roman powers, the believers in Rome were not to rebel violently or cause unnecessary civil unrest, but to submit to the governing authorities (13:1a) with the acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty over the said powers (13:1b).</p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to go to the other end of the spectrum and argue that Paul is urging his audience to give unthinking and critical approval of everything the Roman government did. As mentioned above, Paul was more than willing to critique governments and empires for the sake of God’s kingdom and the cause of Christ.</p>
<p>It would also be a mistake to argue that Romans 13:1-7 is a justification for the active participation in government activities (political office, warfare, etc.) both ancient and modern. Although God is still sovereign over modern nations, Paul’s argument here does not address the issue of active Christian participation in government because that was not on the radar of first-century Christian life in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Instead, Paul’s main point is that his readers should not revolt, but that they should instead stay out of trouble by obeying the authorities and participating in the basic constructs of their society (i.e. paying taxes).</p>
<p>The argument for placing 13:1-7 in the overarching context of Paul’s focus on genuine love in 12:9-13:10 is strengthened by his return to the topic of love in 13:8-10. After the sobering instruction to not rebel but to stay out of trouble and obey the governing authorities, Paul reminds his audience of the importance of love, not only of enemy (of which it could be strongly argued that the governing authorities were a subset!), but of neighbor.</p>
<p>This returns the Roman Christians’ focus to love as the central virtue of Christianity and the “fulfillment of the law” (13:8, 10). They were to faithfully follow Jesus the Messiah King, seeking to bring in his kingdom. But it was unthinkable to Paul to effect God’s kingdom in a way that ran against the grain of that kingdom of love, justice, and peace. Therefore, in the middle of exhortations to genuinely love one’s enemies and neighbors, Paul urges his audience to humbly obey their governing authorities so that they might remain faithful to their King’s calling as they went about his work in the city of Rome.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through the ignorance of the historical background of Paul’s epistle to the Romans as a whole and his instructions in Romans 13:1-7 in particular, the passage at hand has been grossly mis-read and mis-applied in numerous ways since its original composition. Instead of an argument for unthinking obedience to, approval of, and participation in governments past and present, Paul here argues for the Christians in Rome not to revolt against the empire in an attempt to fully usher in God’s kingdom, but to submit humbly to the Roman authorities as they sought to overcome evil with good.</p>
<p>Having an understanding of both the historical background and the context of this passage in the overall argument of the epistle yields an appropriately nuanced view of Paul’s pastoral concern for his audience expressed in these seven controversial verses. Although it is tempting to take this passage out of context and use it to justify opinions on everything from immigration to just war theory, the same hubris that Paul implicitly rebukes in these verses must be resisted if the Scriptures are to be heard and appropriated well.</p>
<p>While some may wish that Romans 13:1-7 had more to say regarding the relationship between church and state, the passage certainly cannot say less than the main points briefly described above. Romans 13:1-7 is not a condensed theology of church and state, but a specific historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, diverting them from rebellion and urging them towards humble submission in order to protect their testimony and thereby enhance their effectiveness in God’s redemptive mission.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> A full analysis of the legitimacy of an anti-imperial Pauline hermeneutic far exceeds the scope of this study. Wright (2004: 82-88 and 2005: 69-79) emphasizes what he sees to be Paul’s anti-imperial themes throughout his writings, and I am indebted to him for the concept of Jesus’ vs. Caesar’s lordship. For an even-handed overview and analysis of this topic, consult Kim (2008), who makes the case that a strong anti-imperial Pauline hermeneutic is difficult to maintain. Despite Kim’s conclusions, however, it seems unwise to completely ignore the implications of Christ’s lordship on both Roman believers in the first century and on North American ones today. The fact that Romans 13:1-7 is such a stumbling block to those in the anti-imperial camp and such an “anomaly” when compared with the implications of Paul’s anti-imperial passages (such as 1 Thess 5, alluded to by Wright [2005]) seems to necessitate a nuanced approach that hears the arguments of those on both sides of this theological debate.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> The commentaries and resources consulted in this study provided A.D. 57 as a consensus view of the date of composition of Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a> (Kim 2008: 37), who points to P. Stuhlmacher, <em>Paul’s Letter to the Romans: A Commentary</em>, trans. S. J. Hafeman (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox, 1994), 198-208; J. A. Fitzmyer, <em>Romans</em> AB 33 (New York: Doubleday, 1993), 662-63. Also, consult Dunn (1988: 768-69).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a> Ibid., 37.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a> The background information in this paragraph comes from the helpful discussion in Witherington III (2004: 304-6).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a> Consult the discussion in Kim (2008: 37) for a helpful counterbalance to the optimistic portrait painted by Witherington III (2004: 304-6). I am also very much indebted to the discussion as the source of the historical information in this paragraph.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a> Cf. Witherington III (2004: 307): “That Paul could say very different and negative things about the state when the state was malfunctioning at the end of Claudius’ reign seems clear enough from 1 and 2 Thessalonians, particularly in 2 Thessalonians 2.” And also consider Wright’s (2004: 86) insistence that Paul had the ability to critique human government: “…in those stories (his visit to Philippi in Acts 16, for instance, or his trial before the Jewish authorities in Acts 23), that precisely when the authorities are getting it all wrong and acting illegally or unjustly Paul has no hesitation in telling them their proper business and insisting that they should follow it.”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref8">[8]</a> <strong>Passionate Aside:</strong> The main problem, then, in applying this passage today, is a very narrow vision of what God’s kingdom entails. That is, “obey your government unless it tells you to do something contrary to the Word of God” is a common enough teaching in the church today, but our vision of God’s redemptive mission is so emaciated that it causes us to miss glaring issues of concern (immigration, warfare, racism, etc.) in our society today. We rape the Scriptures when Romans 13:1-7 is used to justify such ignorance of and even the active participation in streams of society, culture, and policy which go against the grain of God’s kingdom.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref9">[9]</a> (Wright 2005: 78-79), emphasis mine.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a> I am indebted to Dr. Robert Milliman and his blog-post <em>Love and War: Romans 13.1 – 7 in the Context of 12.9 – 13.10</em> (2011) for the initial idea of examining this passage in its context to avoid mis-readings of the text which have been used to justify everything from totalitarian regimes to Christian service in the military.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref11">[11]</a> Schreiner (1998: 678) provides these examples of textual and conceptual links between the two passages. Dunn (1988: 758) also mentions the phrases ekdikew / ekdikoV (12:19; 13:4) and pantwn anqrwpwn / pasin (12:17-18; 13:7) to provide evidence for a link between the two passages, before demonstrating links between Romans 2:7-11 and 13:3-4 in order to refute the claims of some that this passage is a non-Pauline insertion.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref12">[12]</a> I appeal to Dr. Chris Miller’s class notes from BENT 4110 – <em>Romans and Galatians</em> (Spring 2012), and also Wright’s work on Romans (2004) to prove this point, for a complete discussion of this common theme exceeds the scope of this essay. However, for an overview of this theme in Romans, Dunn (1988: 705) cites Rom 1:16-17; 2:15, 17, 28-29; 3:20, 29; 4:16; 9:8, 12; 11:6, 30-32.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref13">[13]</a> Dunn (1988: 705) sees chapters 12-15 as providing a replacement to Lev 18:5 (“this do and live”) as the rule of life for the people of God: “…‘the walk in newness of life’ as over against the walk in the ordinances of Israel’s law (6:4), the service in newness of Spirit as over against oldness of letter (7:6), the obedience of faith in accord with the Spirit fulfilling the requirement of the law unconfused with Jewish ‘works’ (8:4).”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref14">[14]</a> Ibid., 706.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref15">[15]</a> All Bible quotations, unless otherwise noted, come from the NET Bible.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref16">[16]</a> Here I summarize my conclusions from “Historical Background” above.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref17">[17]</a> Schreiner (1998: 679) notes that there is considerable debate as to whether this refers to the eschatological judgment of God or to judgment imposed by earthly rulers. He appeals to the structure of the text (gar in 3a) to conclude that the latter option is more likely.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is righteous. He is just. He is faithful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.</em></p>
<h1 id="romans-11-17">Romans 1:1-17</h1>
<p>If you don’t catch anything else from what I’m about to say, remember this:</p>
<p>God is righteous. He is just. He is faithful.</p>
<p>God has proven himself faithful to his promises of restoring the world, working through his faithful Son, the Messiah, to bring about both our faith in and our faithfulness to him.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain this further.</p>
<p>But first, the objections:</p>
<h1 id="romans-118-32">Romans 1:18-32</h1>
<p>See, at first glance, the big idea above seems ridiculous. God is faithful? Have you seen the world recently? It’s corrupt to the core. Idolatry, sexual immorality, violence, deception, hostility, etc. Because people refused to believe that God is who he says he is, Sin and Death have infected and affected every layer of human existence. If God is truly righteous, why is his world so unrighteous?</p>
<p>(For a theological essay about what the Bible is and why it’s important, read <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/on-scripture/">this piece.</a>)</p>
<h1 id="romans-21-29">Romans 2:1-29</h1>
<p>Furthermore, look at his “chosen people,” the Jews! They are no better than anyone else, despite their privileged position as the ones through whom God promised to work.</p>
<p>They have failed to understand that their identity as God’s people was more inward than outward, and by boasting about their possession of God’s law (instead of allowing God to change them from the inside out), they have become just as unrepentant and stubborn as the rest of the world!</p>
<h1 id="romans-31-8">Romans 3:1-8</h1>
<p>Doesn’t Israel’s utter failure to have faith in God and fulfill their role as a conduit of God’s grace to the entire world mean that God’s plan and promises have failed?</p>
<p>No. Just because some of the Jews failed does not mean all of them have.</p>
<p>And it especially does not mean that God has.</p>
<p>He is still faithful and righteous. But more on that later…</p>
<h1 id="romans-39-20">Romans 3:9-20</h1>
<p>Even though everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, is corrupt…</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Sin and Death, God’s cosmic enemies, have polluted his creation…</p>
<p>Although Scripture itself testifies that we are all unfaithful…</p>
<p>Although the Law which was supposed to guide us in our pursuit of God has only highlighted just how broken we are and how far we have fallen…</p>
<h1 id="romans-321-31">Romans 3:21-31</h1>
<p>Despite all of these things, God is righteous.</p>
<p>God has revealed his covenant faithfulness to us through Jesus the Messiah, the True and Faithful Israelite through whom God has kept his redemptive promises. Through his death, the Messiah has absorbed the wrath of God which our unfaithfulness merited. What’s more, he has reconciled us to God and made possible the truly human life, one which honors God by living in perfect relationship with him and the rest of his creation. Through the Messiah, God is proving his faithfulness in redeeming the entire world.</p>
<h1 id="romans-41-25">Romans 4:1-25</h1>
<p>However, you’ll notice I said “made possible” above. This is because the benefits of what the Messiah has done are only appropriated to us, as they always have been, through faith. The unrepentant Jews made the mistake of assuming that their cultural identity of Torah-obedience was the source of their identity as God’s people. Not so! Look at Abraham! The righteousness of God was appropriated to him because of his faith. After all, he wasn’t even circumcised yet! Therefore, just as Abraham, we all receive the benefits of and incorporation into God’s redemptive mission through faith, and not through the Law. The key is putting our faith in the faithful Messiah.</p>
<h1 id="romans-51-21">Romans 5:1-21</h1>
<p>Pardon me, but this topic is so important that I’m going to run with it for awhile!</p>
<p>See, this combination of the Messiah’s faithfulness and our faith in him means that God has declared us faithful (righteous). Did you hear that? Not only is God faithful, but despite our unfaithfulness, he declares us faithful as well because of his faithful Son and our faith in him!</p>
<p>This means that we now have PEACE (and not enmity) with God!</p>
<p>This is possible because, get this, at every point at which our father Adam (and everyone ever since) failed, the Messiah has perfectly succeeded!</p>
<p>Before placing our faith in the Messiah’s faithfulness, we were all “in Adam.” That is, we were at enmity with God because of our unfaithfulness to him which deserved condemnation. However, the Messiah’s faithful obedience didn’t just undo our unrighteousness, putting us back on level ground. Instead, it has taken us to the soaring heights of God’s own righteousness! We are now “in the Messiah”!</p>
<h1 id="romans-61-25">Romans 6:1-25</h1>
<p>But that’s not the only transfer that’s happened! Being moved from “in Adam” to “in the Messiah” also means that we’ve been moved from the Death which Sin brings to the Life which the Messiah offers to us! While we were “in Adam,” we were slaves to Sin and Death, dominated by them and without freedom. However, now that we are “in the Messiah,” we have choices! Free choices! Sin still brings death, but we have been set free and we have the ability and opportunity to make proper choices and live life to its fullest by being truly human, giving glory to our gracious Creator!</p>
<h1 id="romans-71-6">Romans 7:1-6</h1>
<p>All of this has radically changed our relationship to God’s Law. Through the transfer from Adam to Messiah, from Death to Life, we have been set free from the Law’s condemnation! We can now live a life where God’s Spirit writes the Law on our hearts!</p>
<h1 id="romans-77-25">Romans 7:7-25</h1>
<p>See, beforehand, while we were still “in Adam,” the Law didn’t really help us out. Because of our initial unfaithfulness, the Law highlighted our brokenness and need for a Messiah Savior. It condemned us in the sight of a holy God. Although there was nothing wrong with the Law itself, there was something profoundly wrong with us, and the Law was very good at showing that!</p>
<h1 id="romans-81-30">Romans 8:1-30</h1>
<p>But our faith in Jesus the faithful Messiah changes things. As I mentioned above, we have now been set free from the Law’s old condemnation! The Spirit of God writes God’s law on our very heart. Not only that, the Spirit also gives us the power to live a life which is pleasing to God, in right relationship with our Creator and all of his creation. The Spirit is both our GPS and our engine. Therefore, we no longer have to worry about being condemned by the Law, because the Spirit guides and enables us to fulfill the Law’s requirements as those who are “in the Messiah.”</p>
<h1 id="romans-831-39">Romans 8:31-39</h1>
<p>Take a moment to think about all I have said so far. Despite the unfaithfulness of all humanity, God has proven himself faithful, most notably through his faithful Son, the Messiah. Look at all God has done for us and given to us through the Messiah! Consider the depths of his love for us! Nothing can separate us from the love of God and the love of our Messiah! God is indeed righteous. Although the plan has not yet been fully accomplished, he is well on his way toward redeeming all that he has made.</p>
<p>However, we still haven’t covered everything. If you’ll remember, there’s still that tricky bit about the failure of God’s chosen people. Even though God has done all of this for us through the Messiah, doesn’t the failure of Israel damage his righteousness?</p>
<p>Can God still be fully faithful if it appears his specific promises to/about Israel have failed?</p>
<p>Despite the apparent failure of Israel, God is still righteous and faithful!</p>
<p>Consider three reasons why:</p>
<h1 id="romans-91-29">Romans 9:1-29</h1>
<p>Firstly, if you will remember, God never promised to use every single ethnic Jew as one of his chosen people. Consider Abraham’s descendants, they were numbered through Isaac and not Ishmael. Similarly, Isaac’s descendants were numbered through Jacob and not Esau. This does not mean that God is unfair, for he is not obligated to show mercy to anyone! It also does not mean that God was eternally unloving to those he did not choose at specific times to work through in Israel’s history toward the coming of the Messiah! The main point isn’t that Ishmael and Esau were damned to hell. It’s that God has never promised to choose and use every single ethnic descendant of Abraham. It is therefore unfair to act as if God has promised to always use all physical Jews. As I alluded to before, the *true* Jews have always been so inwardly, not just outwardly.</p>
<h1 id="romans-930-1021">Romans 9:30-10:21</h1>
<p>Secondly, let’s not blame God for what the Israelites themselves failed to do! Just because many (but not all!) Israelites have failed to have faith throughout the years does NOT mean that God is no longer faithful. Although God never promised to choose and use every ethnic Jew as one of his chosen people, all Jews did have more than enough opportunities to place their faith in God and live in faithfulness to him! However, as mentioned toward the beginning, they failed to realize the key role that faith played in the process. They boasted in their ethnic/national identity of Torah-following instead of boasting in the faithfulness of their God and fulfilling their priestly duties to the world. Please do not blame this failure on God. He has remained faithful and gracious.</p>
<h1 id="romans-111-36">Romans 11:1-36</h1>
<p>Thirdly, and finally, the story is not yet over! The failure/rejection of Israel is neither total nor permanent. God has always preserved a faithful remnant. That is, there has always existed, within ethnic Israel, the true Israel, the faithful people of God. Despite Israel’s failures, there has always been a remnant, graciously preserved by God to accomplish his purposes. But this remnant will not always be partial! There will come a day in the future when God will do through Israel abundantly above and beyond what he has ever done before. A complete, full generation of Israelites will someday be rescued and used by God to bless the world, completely dispelling any notions that God has somehow failed his people. Despite Israel’s faithlessness, God has remained, and will always remain, faithful and righteous.</p>
<p>This is more than even I can comprehend!</p>
<p>Praise be to God!</p>
<h1 id="romans-12">Romans 12</h1>
<p>In view of God’s righteousness, his faithfulness in redeeming the world and putting it back together again through his faithful Son, the Messiah, let’s consider what it looks like to join him in his redemptive mission! If you’ll remember, our faith in the faithfulness of the Messiah is designed to bring about our own faithfulness as well!</p>
<p>What does this faithfulness look like, in response to all God has done?</p>
<p>It starts with a refusal to conform to the world’s ways of life. Remember my mentioning of the consequences of Sin and Death earlier? Well, in addition to those things, you must also refuse to be conformed to the ways of pride and division. Instead of conformity, pursue transformation. Allow the Spirit of God to renew your mind, and it will revolutionize your relationships. Pursue things like unity, genuine love, harmony, and peace. In all circumstances, even when you are being persecuted, refuse to be overcome by evil. Instead, overcome evil with good.</p>
<h1 id="romans-13">Romans 13</h1>
<p>This all more-or-less makes sense when applied to fellow believers and neighbors, but when we start talking about persecutors and the government, things get tricky!</p>
<p>The crucial thing to remember is that, although God is in the process of invading this fallen world to establish his righteous kingdom, this does NOT mean that you should go violently overthrowing the Roman Empire, or any other empire for that matter! This is because the King we follow stands for, as I’ve just mentioned, genuine love, harmony, and peace. This rules-out violent rebellion and vengeful retaliation.</p>
<p>I’m NOT arguing, by any means, that you should mindlessly participate in the currents of society and government which go against God’s kingdom. Stay alert and faithfully follow the Messiah!</p>
<p>However, instead of trying to overthrow the Empire, you should reasonably and respectfully participate in society. Trust God’s sovereignty over human affairs by submitting to the authorities and paying your taxes. God’s kingdom will be established from the inside out!</p>
<p>These things are all related. The same characteristics of your love for each other and for your neighbors should be applied to persecutors and the governing authorities. If “in Adam,” then this stuff sounds ridiculous. However, we are “in the Messiah,” and this radically changes everything. Let us live in LOVE, the fulfillment of God’s law, as we await our Messiah’s return…</p>
<h1 id="romans-14-15">Romans 14-15</h1>
<p>…which brings me to the most pressing issue I wish to address.</p>
<p>See, all of this means very little if it does not impact how you Jews and Gentiles relate to each other within the body of the Messiah, the Church. Now that you are both accepted as full members of God’s holy people, I realize that there has been quite a bit of social tension created, specifically with regards to food! While I could give you an apostolically-prescribed menu, that would defeat the purpose, because my main goal (and God’s main goal, for that matter) in this is to see you unified, harmoniously working together as Jews and Gentiles for God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Here’s why this is important. If you allow something as simple and amoral as food to fragment you, think of what a slap in the face that is to the Messiah, who moved heaven and earth to defeat Sin and Death and reconcile you all to God.</p>
<p>Sin and Death destroy relationships.</p>
<p>Our Messiah destroyed Sin and Death.</p>
<p>If you, then, go back and destroy relationships over things such as food, you are effectively undoing the work of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Do not let this be so! Overwhelm each other with grace and love as you pursue unity!</p>
<p>Use these principles within the body to settle all further and future differences as well, for your unity and love for one another prove that God’s mission is working in the world!</p>
<h1 id="romans-16">Romans 16</h1>
<p>I am confident that God has been and will continue to be at work in your lives. Deeply consider the things I have said to you. But take heart, for we serve a God who loves human beings, and that is why he has chosen to use us in his redemptive mission!</p>
<p>Just don’t forfeit this precious role by allowing people to cause dissensions among you!</p>
<p>I have now come full circle in my argument.</p>
<p>Despite our failures, God is righteous in his mission of redeeming the world through his Son, the Messiah, and through his people, the Church, of which you are a part.</p>
<p>His faithfulness to us through the Messiah is designed to bring about (through our faith in him) our own faithfulness and obedience to him.</p>
<p>May our righteous God and our faithful Messiah be praised and given glory forever!</p>
<p>Amen!</p>

      <title>Unity?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/unity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2012 19:22:24 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I’ve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.</p>
<p>What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I’ve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.</p>
<p>It’s not that I’ve never heard about the importance of unity before. But when the topic has been addressed in the past, it’s amounted to little more than being nice to my friends…people who are already likely to be remarkably similar to me, people already within the little camp of Christianity in which I have grown-up.</p>
<p>But it’s never been encouraged to spread to other Christian “camps.” Forget the Pentecostals, Anglicans, Methodists, Catholics, Presbyterians, etc. If the pastor’s feeling a bit edgy, we can partner with them on service projects, but unless the “others” get their act together, they are to be tolerated at best, and at worst ridiculed.</p>
<p>Instead, in my particular stream of Christianity, the focus has been placed on two things: <strong>doctrinal orthodoxy</strong> and <strong>moral purity</strong>.</p>
<p>Please don’t hear me wrongly, I am not denying the importance of either of these two things. God is meant to be known well, and to do that we must think, talk, teach, and speak about him well. Theology is not to be a shoddy enterprise, and we must constantly examine ourselves, aware of the shortcomings of our humanness, in the pursuit of understanding of Yahweh. Furthermore, Yahweh is a holy God. He hates Sin and Death, and if we are serious about following him, we must hate Sin and Death as well.</p>
<p>Christ calls us to live Genesis 1-2 lives in a Genesis 3 world.</p>
<p>But, wait a second. Go back and read that again. “Christ calls us to live Genesis 1-2 lives in a Genesis 3 world.” What popped into your head as you read that sentence? What should characterize that Genesis 1-2 kind of life?</p>
<p>I fear that, if you’ve inherited the same stream of Christianity that I have, <strong>unity</strong> and <strong>interpersonal relationships</strong> were not the first things to color your vision of what Genesis 1-2 would look like today. Instead, we (conservative evangelical North American Christians) are much more likely to think of living a morally spotless life driven by a flawless theology. With no sin to fetter us and lead us toward doctrinal laxity, we would be free to enjoy God forever.</p>
<p>We have flattened Christianity by focusing on these things at the expense of focusing on the rich vision of community and unity that we find in the pages of Scripture. Read Genesis 1-2. We were created to enjoy God, yes. We were created to live without sin, yes. But we were created to enjoy and be enjoyed by each other. We were made to know and be known. God’s perfect shalom included much more than moral purity and doctrinal orthodoxy. It included perfect <strong>relationships</strong>: with God, with each other, with our own “self”s, and with all of creation.</p>
<p>And likewise, the Fall of Genesis 3 broke relationships. It separated us from God, estranged us from each other, introduced discord within our own psyches, and infected the creation in which we dwell. Sin and Death were unleashed into the cosmos, and they have polluted and twisted every layer.</p>
<p>The call back to Genesis 1-2 therefore involves much more than right doctrine and moral purity. God is in the process of redeeming everything. And every time we cut his redemptive mission in half (or sometimes smaller), we do so at our own peril.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…toward the administration of the fullness of the times, to head up<sup> </sup><em><strong>all things</strong></em> in Christ – the things in *heaven<sup> </sup>*and the things on <em>earth.</em> (Ephesians 1:10 NET)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that God’s heart breaks over the lack of unity in his Church today. Is he pleased with the individual moral sins we love to emphasize? By no means. Is he pleased with bad theology? No way. But something is seriously amiss if we do not think that God’s heart breaks over the fragmentation within the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>What do you think about this issue? Why does this not bother us like it should? And most importantly, what can we do to address this problem?</p>
<p>Grace and peace,</p>
<p>~Josh</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031049298X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=faithinirelan-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399373&amp;amp;creativeASIN=031049298X&#34;&gt;The King Jesus Gospel: The Original Good News Revisited&lt;/a&gt; by Scot McKnight, who makes the claim that the gospel is the saving story of Jesus as Messiah, King, and Lord as the completion to the story of Israel, I started to notice some profound gospel messages in the Christmas carols we often sing during this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that several of these carols go much deeper (much more biblical) than the personal salvation “gospel” of sin-management that we often preach and sing about. What’s tragic is that, even though these carols are quite possibly the best-known Christian songs, their familiarity (and the fact that we only break them out for 1/12th of the year), makes it quite easy to ignore their substance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>Christians, my brothers and sisters,</strong></p>
<p><strong>instead of allowing Fox News to persuade us that the “War on Christmas” is being fought in the stores when people say “Happy Holidays,”</strong></p>
<p><strong>instead of thinking that our Messiah’s main “sorrow” in December is that more people are not saying “Merry Christmas” more often…</strong></p>
<p><strong>…let us examine ourselves. How guilty are we of reducing our “King,” “everlasting Lord,” “Prince of Peace,” “Sun of Righteousness,” and our Messiah into an individual savior whose birth, life, death, and resurrection accomplishes nothing more than getting us into heaven when we die and helping us to manage our personal sins in the meantime?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Perhaps we should be more concerned with our emaciated versions of the gospel than with how we are greeted when entering and exiting our society’s temples to consumerism and greed.</strong></p>
<p>Please join me in attempting to look through the unfortunately and undeservedly trite familiarity of this song to see its portrayal of the gospel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hark! The herald angels sing,</strong><br>
<strong>“Glory to the newborn King;</strong><br>
<strong>Peace on earth, and mercy mild,</strong><br>
<strong>God and sinners reconciled!”</strong><br>
<strong>Joyful, all ye nations rise,</strong><br>
<strong>Join the triumph of the skies;</strong><br>
<strong>With th’angelic host proclaim,</strong><br>
<strong>“Christ is born in Bethlehem!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hark! the herald angels sing,</strong><br>
<strong>“Glory to the newborn King!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Christ, by highest Heav’n adored;</strong><br>
<strong>Christ the everlasting Lord;</strong><br>
<strong>Late in time, behold Him come,</strong><br>
<strong>Offspring of a virgin’s womb.</strong><br>
<strong>Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;</strong><br>
<strong>Hail th’incarnate Deity,</strong><br>
<strong>Pleased with us in flesh to dwell,</strong><br>
<strong>Jesus our Emmanuel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hail the heav’nly Prince of Peace!</strong><br>
<strong>Hail the Sun of Righteousness!</strong><br>
<strong>Light and life to all He brings,</strong><br>
<strong>Ris’n with healing in His wings.</strong><br>
<strong>Mild He lays His glory by,</strong><br>
<strong>Born that man no more may die.</strong><br>
<strong>Born to raise the sons of earth,</strong><br>
<strong>Born to give them second birth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Come, Desire of nations, come,</strong><br>
<strong>Fix in us Thy humble home;</strong><br>
<strong>Rise, the woman’s conqu’ring Seed,</strong><br>
<strong>Bruise in us the serpent’s head.</strong><br>
<strong>Now display Thy saving power,</strong><br>
<strong>Ruined nature now restore;</strong><br>
<strong>Now in mystic union join</strong><br>
<strong>Thine to ours, and ours to Thine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface,</strong><br>
<strong>Stamp Thine image in its place:</strong><br>
<strong>Second Adam from above,</strong><br>
<strong>Reinstate us in Thy love.</strong><br>
<strong>Let us Thee, though lost, regain,</strong><br>
<strong>Thee, the Life, the inner man:</strong><br>
<strong>O, to all Thyself impart,</strong><br>
<strong>Formed in each believing heart.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May your hearts and minds be set upon Jesus the Messiah, King, Lord, Savior, and Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>And may you all, in doing so, have a very Merry Christmas.</p>

      <title>Church and State</title>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/church_and_state/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Note: for a more recent piece on the relationship between Church and State, see my essay: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2015/12/08/improvising-church-state/&#34;&gt;Improvising Church and State&lt;/a&gt;.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read an article by Kevin DeYoung at The Gospel Coalition: &lt;a href=&#34;http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/05/26/thinking-theologically-about-memorial-day/?comments#comments&#34;&gt;“Thinking Theologically About Memorial Day”&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to his intro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post probably has something to make everyone unhappy. But here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Memorial Day on Monday (in the U.S.) and, no doubt, a number of patriotic services scheduled for this Sunday, I want to offer a few theses on patriotism and the church. Each of these points could be substantially expanded and beg more detailed defense and explanation, but since this is a blog and not a term paper, I’ll try to keep this under 1500 words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I just read an article by Kevin DeYoung at The Gospel Coalition: <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/05/26/thinking-theologically-about-memorial-day/?comments#comments">“Thinking Theologically About Memorial Day”</a>. Listen to his intro:</p>

Each of these points could be substantially expanded and beg more detailed defense and explanation, but since this is a blog and not a term paper, I’ll try to keep this under 1500 words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DeYoung goes on to cover five main points:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Being a Christian does not remove national and ethnic identities.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Patriotism, like other earthly “prides,” can be a virtue or vice.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Allegiance to God and allegiance to your country are not inherently incompatible.</strong></li>
<li><strong>God’s people are not tied to any one nation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All this leads to one final point: while patriotism can be good, the church is not a good place for patriotism.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I really appreciate this attempt to arrive at a balance between those who simply baptize their American patriotism and call it Christianity and those who view every instance of patriotism as damnable idolatry. I loved DeYoung’s last paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some parts of the church, every hint of patriotism makes you a jingoistic idolater. You are allowed to love every country except your own. But in other parts of the church, true religion blends too comfortably into civil religion. You are allowed to worship in our services as long as you love America as much as we do. I don’t claim to have arrived at the golden mean, but I imagine many churches could stand to think more carefully about their theology of God and country. Churches should be glad to have their members celebrate Memorial Day with gusto this Monday. We should be less sanguine about celebrating it with pomp and circumstance on Sunday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, while I want to avoid the extreme position of viewing every form of patriotism as idolatry, I think that American Christians too often give unthinking allegiance and support to the country in which we live. Without demonizing the country in which we live, the amazing freedoms which we are able to enjoy, and the men and women who have sacrificed to secure and preserve those freedoms for us, we need to always remember that we, if we belong to Christ, are ultimately citizens of a greater Kingdom than the United States of America. DeYoung has this to say about the compatibility of allegiance to God and allegiance to one’s country:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you read all that the New Testament says about governing authorities in places like Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2, you see that the normal situation is one of compatible loyalties. The church is not the state and the state is not God, but this does not mean the church must always be against the state. In general, then, it’s possible to be a good Christian and a good American, or a good Ghanaian or a good Korean. Patriotism is not bad. Singing your national anthem and getting choked up is not bad. Allegiance to God and allegiance to your country do not have to be at odds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct, allegiance to God and allegiance to country do not have to be diametrically opposed. Christians should live as respectful citizens of their respective nations. However, do we <strong>really</strong> believe that Ghanaian and Korean Christians are every bit as good as American ones? I know everyone’s going to say “yes,” but do we <em><strong>really</strong></em> believe this? What if those Ghanaian and/or Korean Christians don’t like the United States of America? Are they still as pleasing to God in our eyes, or does their righteousness depend on their support of the Red, White, and Blue? Because a lot of what I have seen/heard/experienced in the American church seems to subtly teach that our country is the best and most deserving of God’s favor. I retweeted the following recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m waiting for the Iranian and N. Korean editions of the Patriot’s Bible. <a href="http://www.americanpatriotsbible.com/">http://www.americanpatriotsbible.com</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does something like this have the potential to upset so many American Christians? “Iran and North Korea are clearly more morally evil than the United States,” some will say. Maybe so, but since when does our country get to claim the right of being God-approved? Can Christians in Ghana sing “God bless Ghana”? Perhaps our reactions to tweets/messages/statements like the one above only prove the problem.</p>
<p>Before someone calls me a heretic or an anti-American, please know that simply questioning the American church’s commitment to the USA does NOT immediately make me into someone who burns flags and pickets soldiers funerals. That would be swinging to the other end of the spectrum, and I do not believe that such a dichotomy exists. If someone does not give unquestioning allegiance to the USA, it does not mean that they automatically align themselves with the crazies over at Westboro Baptist Church.</p>
<p>I am a <strong>Christian</strong>.</p>
<p>I am also an American citizen. I obey the law, salute the flag, am respectful of the men and women in the armed forces, grateful for their sacrifices, and thankful for the fact that I live in a country where I can enjoy unparalleled freedoms (such as writing blog posts like this without having to fear for my life).</p>
<p>…but I do <em><strong>not</strong></em> give my ultimate allegiance to the American flag, or any other national standard for that matter. I pledge my ultimate allegiance to Jesus the Messiah. And while most Christians in the United States of America would nod their heads and agree with that previous statement, I think that we all need to consider whether we are living it out or not. Will our church services on Memorial Day reflect this?</p>
<p>May our eternal and infinite God bless his <em>global</em> bride, his <em>global</em> people, his <strong><em>global</em> Church</strong> as Christians from every tribe, tongue, nation, and language follow their true King, Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<p>~Josh.</p>

      <title>What the Bible Says About Poverty: The Book of Proverbs</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/bible-poverty-proverbs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2011 23:44:16 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-poverty-and-wealth&#34;&gt;Introduction: Poverty and Wealth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction-poverty-and-wealth">Introduction: Poverty and Wealth</h1>
<p>In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.</p>
<p>Modern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.</p>
<p>However, one can effortlessly go through daily life in middle class America without giving much thought or care to the billions of people living in poverty worldwide. Furthermore, one can even profess faith in Jesus Christ and regularly attend an average evangelical church in the United States without being prompted to pay the poor, underprivileged, and oppressed of this world any mind.</p>
<p>In this milieu of wealth and poverty existing side by side in an atmosphere of confusion and apathy, the book of Proverbs provides relevant insights into the nature of poverty, the nature of Yahweh, and how his people should respond to it.</p>
<p>(For more on how Christians should think about poverty and wealth, see my essay <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/09/24/christians-and-wealth-2/">“Christians and Wealth.”</a>)</p>
<h2 id="descriptions-of-poverty-effects-and-causes">Descriptions of Poverty: Effects and Causes</h2>
<p>Many proverbs are devoted to describing the harsh realities of poverty, showing that the Hebrew sages were well aware of its existence and characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
<p>These proverbs frequently describe the poor in direct contrast to the wealthy. Consider Proverbs 10:15:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A rich man’s wealth is in his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The force of the antithetical parallelism of this verse is hard to overlook. Whybray explains that the main point “is that wealth protects the rich from the vicissitudes of life, while the poor, having no resources to fall back on, are easily vulnerable to total disaster” (1994, 165).</p>
<p>The word used for “poor” here is <em><strong>dal</strong>.</em> While Whybray states that this word is synonymous with the other Hebrew terms for “poor” (<em>˓ānı̂, ˒ebyôn,</em> and <em>rāš</em>)in Proverbs (1994, 165), <em>The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament</em> (TWOT) differentiates <em>dal</em> from the other three, saying that “unlike <em>˓ānı̂</em>, <em>dal</em> does not emphasize pain or oppression; unlike <em>˒ebyôn</em>, it does not primarily emphasize need, and unlike <em>rāš</em>, it represents those who lack rather than the destitute.” <em>Dal</em> refers to <strong>the lack of both material and social resources</strong> (Harris, et al. 1999).</p>
<p>This lack of social resources can be seen in the proverbs that describe how poverty affects relationships. Proverbs 14:20 says that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The poor is disliked even by his neighbor, but the rich has many friends.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This same theme is reiterated in chapter 19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wealth brings many new friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend” (19:4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expanded across two verses, it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Many seek the favor of a generous man, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. All a poor man’s brothers hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him!” (19:6-7a).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These three proverbs contrast the social standings of the wealthy and the impoverished. Alden’s comment on 14:20 is apt when he says that “the unfortunate truth [is] that greed is a more compelling trait than generosity; people are more eager to have rich friends than poor ones” (1983, 114).</p>
<p>Proverbs 19:6-7a expands upon this, describing how people are naturally drawn to relationships that give them material benefit. It is rare, however, to find people who are drawn to relationships that would cost them materially. Even a poor man’s family members “hate him”!</p>
<p>Bridges says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As the winter brooks, filled from the opening springs and the torrents from heaven, are dried up and vanish before the summer heat; so these friends of the poor go far from him, cold, distant, and vanishing in the day of his calamity” (1987, cf. 1846, 312).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Materially and socially, poverty wreaks havoc on the lives of those it entraps.</p>
<h3 id="causes">Causes</h3>
<p>Given the terrible effects and characteristics of poverty, Proverbs naturally contains many admonitions to avoid its causes.</p>
<p>Causes of poverty listed in Proverbs include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>a “slack hand” (laziness) (10:4),</li>
<li>ignorance of instruction (13:18),</li>
<li>endless talk (without toil/labor) (14:23),</li>
<li>hastiness (21:15),</li>
<li>the love of pleasure (21:17),</li>
<li>drunkenness and gluttony (23:21),</li>
<li>worthless pursuits (28:19),</li>
<li>and stinginess (28:22).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of particular interest is the repetition of the warning against excessive slumber if one is to avoid poverty (6:10-11; 20:13; 23:21; 24:33-34).</p>
<p>Proverbs 6:10-11 and 24:33-34 include the almost verbatim admonition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleep (as compared with labor) might give the initial benefits of rest and relaxation, but when developed into an excessive habit, it can have disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>John Chrysostom comments upon 6:11:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is work at first difficult? Then look to its results. Is idleness sweet? Then consider what comes out of it in the end. So let us look not at the beginning of things, but let us also see where they end up” (Wright 2005, 50).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach perhaps summarizes most of the practical warnings in Proverbs about avoiding poverty. <strong>What initially seems like the easiest and most comfortable choice will rarely, if ever, lead to success.</strong></p>
<p>Set apart from the practical warnings of avoiding poverty, however, is Proverbs 22:16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verb “oppress” here is the term <em>˓ā∙šǎq</em>, meaning “mistreat, i.e., treat a disadvantaged member of society unjustly with the effect of causing one to suffer ill-treatment” (Swanson 1997).</p>
<p>Although the Hebrew of this verse is quite difficult and there is little concurrence among commentators as to its proper interpretation (Whybray 1994, 322-323), the sense of it seems to be that <strong>the end result of oppressing the impoverished for material gain is only further poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>Proverbs 30:14 comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses make the transition from descriptions of poverty to responses to its existence, highlighting the uncomfortable truth that <strong>improper treatment of the poor can bring disaster</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="responses-to-poverty-yahweh-and-the-poor">Responses to Poverty: Yahweh and the Poor</h2>
<p>It is clear that Proverbs gives its readers a thorough understanding of the dreadfulness of poverty and the importance of avoiding it.</p>
<p>However, this understanding does little to inform the audience of <strong>how we should respond to the existence of poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>The surest foundation for a proper response to poverty is undoubtedly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the character of Yahweh with regards to the oppressed and impoverished</span>.</p>
<p>Consider Proverbs 14:31:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first line of this proverb is echoed in 17:5a, and the second (seemingly unrelated) line of 17:5, “he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished,” has been taken by some commentators to refer to those who rejoice over not just calamity in general, but specifically the ruin of the poor (Whybray 1994, 255 and Clifford 1999, 164).</p>
<p>If this is the case, then these two proverbs taken together make the same point with both a positive promise and a negative warning. Clifford states the main point particularly well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The dignity of each human being comes from being created by God. Contempt towards anyone insults the person’s maker. The example of the poor person, the type perhaps least likely to gain respect, is used to dramatize the point. Every human being, irrespective of wealth, is worthy of respect” (1999, 164).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same point is made in Proverbs 22:2, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and also in 29:13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our treatment of the poor needs to be based upon the fact that they have been made in the image of Yahweh and are therefore worthy of dignity and respect.</strong> To deny them the treatment that each and every human being deserves is not just stinginess, it is <strong>an insult and an offense to the Creator.</strong></p>
<p>However, Proverbs goes further than appeals to imago Dei in its teachings about our treatment of the poor.</p>
<p>Atkinson says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The oppression of the poor is both a violation of someone who should be respected because he or she bears the image of the Creator, and also an attitude which does not reflect the character of the Creator, who is himself on the side of the poor” (1996, 111).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 22:22-23 delivers a stunningly vivid warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not rob the poor, because he is poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate, for the LORD will plead their cause and rob of life those who rob them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader is told to not take justice from the poor because they have the LORD as their defender at the gate (the site of legal proceedings). “The poor, by not having human protectors, have Yahweh as their protector. Paradoxically, their poverty gives them a more powerful protector than the rich could afford” (Clifford 1999, 207).</p>
<p>This gives a glimpse into a thematic truth of Scripture that has been called God’s “bias to the poor.” Atkinson quotes Karl Barth to further explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The human righteousness required by God and established in obedience – the righteousness which according to Amos 5:24 should pour down as a mighty stream – has necessarily the character of a vindication of right in favour of the threatened innocent, the oppressed poor, widows, orphans, and aliens.</p>
<p>For this reason, in the relations and events in the life of his people, God always takes his stand unconditionally and passionately on this side and this side alone: against the lofty and on behalf of the lowly; against those who enjoy right and privilege and on behalf of those who are denied it and deprived of it” (1996, 111-112, cf. Barth, <em>Church Dogmatics</em> II/1 [T.&amp;T. Clark, 1957], p. 387)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>God’s heart for and even bias toward the poor extends well beyond the book of Proverbs</strong>. If one pays close attention, it is readily apparent that Scripture is saturated with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahweh intervened to save his people from the oppression and poverty they suffered in at the hands of the Egyptians (cf. Exodus 3:7-9).</li>
<li>He made his frustration at his people’s improper treatment and distortion of the impoverished and the needy known through the prophets (cf. Isaiah 10:1-3; Jeremiah 5:26-29; 7:5-7; Amos 2:7; 4:1; 5:10-15; 6:4-7; Micah 2:2).</li>
<li>Jesus the Messiah cited his own mission as one that was inextricably tied to the poor and oppressed (cf. Luke 4:16-21).</li>
<li>The final judgment will be executed (at least partially so) with regards to the treatment (or mistreatment) of the poor and the needy (cf. Matthew 25:31-46).</li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture makes it abundantly clear that <strong>God’s heart is for the impoverished, destitute, and oppressed</strong>.</p>
<p>It is important to establish this truth well in order to rightly proceed in our actions and attitudes toward the poor and the oppressed. This is because <strong>it is entirely too easy to think of God’s actions and attitudes as being most closely aligned with people who are just like us.</strong></p>
<p>However, for the vast majority of Christians in the United States who live life in relatively extravagant comfort and ease, it comes as somewhat of a shock that God’s bias might actually be <em><strong>against</strong></em> us if we do not take this issue seriously!</p>
<p>Proverbs reflects that what is at stake here is much more than just our consciences, the minor twangs of guilt or moments of self-righteousness we too often experience in our infrequent interactions with the poor.</p>
<h2 id="responses-to-poverty-consequences-and-rewards">Responses to Poverty: Consequences and Rewards</h2>
<p>The teachings in Proverbs regarding the treatment of the poor can be divided into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>those that display negative consequences for improper treatment,</li>
<li>those that display positive rewards for proper treatment,</li>
<li>and those that juxtapose the two.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h3>
<p>Proverbs 21:13 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever closes his ears to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The frightening reciprocity of this verse hits hard when, in our culture, we are too often distracted by other things which are “more important” than attending to the needs of the poor. When we find ourselves in a moment of dire need, how can we expect to be answered if we have not answered the needy when we were able to do so?</p>
<p>Another warning against mistreating the poor that includes a form of retribution against the offender is Proverbs 28:8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit gathers is for him who is generous to the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whybray claims that the word for “interest” refers to “interest which was levied by deduction from the original loan but which had to be repaid in full,” and that “profit” refers to “an additional charge levied on repayment” (1994, 391).</p>
<p>The point is that <strong>money taken from the poor will not do its wicked owner any good,</strong> and has the potential to end up in the hands of righteous men which will in turn help to meet the needs of the poor.</p>
<h3 id="positive-rewards">Positive Rewards</h3>
<p>In addition, Proverbs contains several verses that positively portray, and thereby encourage, generosity towards the poor and preservation of their justice.</p>
<p>Consider Proverbs 19:17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proverb promises a reward to those who treat the poor with generosity. However, the main point is not to treat them with benevolence out of desire for a reward.</p>
<p>Whybray captures the point well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“there is no idea here of a quid pro quo: no intention to encourage generosity simply for the reward which it will bring. The underlying thought is that generosity is characteristic of a person who is righteous; and the proverb reflects the basic belief that righteousness is, and ought to be, materially rewarded” (1994, 282).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A virtually identical point is made in Proverbs 22:9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the well-known wise woman discussed in chapter 31 “opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy” (31:20). <strong>Giving generously to the poor is a mark of a righteous person, one whose life will be blessed by Yahweh.</strong></p>
<h3 id="combinations">Combinations</h3>
<p>Finally, some proverbs combine the negative and positive aspects of the previously mentioned verses through antithetical parallelism.</p>
<p>A prime example is Proverbs 14:21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner, but blessed is he who is generous to the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse highlights the benefits of generosity against the backdrop of the consequences of scorning one’s neighbor.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, Proverbs 28:27 says that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not the curses come from the poor who have been denied assistance, or from Yahweh himself, the point remains that <strong>there are rewards in caring for the impoverished and consequences for not doing so.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to generosity, however, the Hebrew sages also expressed concern for the <strong>justice</strong> of the poor.</p>
<p>Proverbs 29:7 makes it clear that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of justice for the poor is also stated later in the chapter in verse 14:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a king faithfully judges the poor, his throne will be established forever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given Yahweh’s “bias” toward the poor and their status as his image bearers, it would do one well to be concerned with their legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>It is not enough to simply not oppress the poor.</strong> Proverbs, along with the rest of Scripture, seems to mandate <strong>advocating for their justice.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In our current context of extravagant wealth and abject poverty existing side by side in a realm of confusion, apathy, and even malice towards the impoverished, Proverbs contains some timely and powerful teaching.</p>
<p>The Hebrew sages had a firm grasp on both the tempting causes and terrible effects of poverty. They, therefore, put a strong emphasis on <strong>avoiding it at all costs through diligence and hard work</strong>.</p>
<p>However, this did not lead them to <strong>abandon</strong> a proper view towards the poor, and they grounded all of their teachings about the proper treatment of the poor in <strong>the unchanging and perfect character of Yahweh, who is firmly committed to their protection and justice.</strong></p>
<p>The modern readers of this ancient book would do well to heed its teachings regarding poverty, and to proceed with attitudes and actions in imitation of Yahweh in their interactions with and opinions of the poor, destitute, and oppressed of this world.</p>
