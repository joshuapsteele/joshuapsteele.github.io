I’d like to share my top tip/trick. Here it is:\nUse a Pen/Pencil/Finger as a Pacer When You Read That’s right. Whenever I read these days, I’m using something as a pacer, tracing under each line of text as I read it. (I’m usually also standing and pacing around to avoid falling asleep!)\nIt might seem stupidly simple tip, but it’s crazy how much using something – whether a pen, pencil, or just your finger – as a pacer can help you read faster. It cuts down on the number of times your eye bounces around on the page, and it enables you to read exactly as quickly as you’d like to – you can slow down or speed up at will.\nI first considered using a pacer while reading after reading Tim Ferriss’s wildly popular blog post, “Scientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20 Minutes”. I encourage you to give that post a read if you’re interested.\nOr, if you’d rather watch a video of Tim teaching his technique, check this one out:\nAnyways, I hope this simple tip helps you to read faster when you want to! Give it a try and let me know what you think.\nGot any reading tips you’d like to share? Post them in the comments below! ",
