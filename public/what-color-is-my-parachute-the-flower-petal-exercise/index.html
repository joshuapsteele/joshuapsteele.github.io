First, I’ll summarize the 7-part “Flower Petal” exercise—a comprehensive self-assessment geared toward the workplace. Then, I’ll share *my* results from the self-assessment.\nAh, but first, my TL;DR: If you’re looking for work, or going to be looking for work soon, do yourself a huge favor and buy the latest edition of What Color Is Your Parachute. Work through the book, especially the Flower Petal Exercise. It’s well-worth your time!\nThe Flower Petal Exercise The Flower Petal Exercise is a self-discovery tool designed to help individuals identify their career objectives and life goals. Using a visual analogy of a flower, it engages users in an interactive exploration of their skills, interests, values, and professional aspirations.\nThe ‘flower’ consists of seven ‘petals’ or components, each representing a different aspect of a person’s work-life:\nPeople Environments: Here, you define the type of people you enjoy working with. Consider factors such as company culture, team size, or the sociopolitical views of your colleagues. Working Conditions: This focuses on the conditions under which you perform best. It may include factors like flexible working hours, remote work, office settings, or your preference for a structured versus unstructured work environment. Transferable Skills: These are skills you’ve acquired over time that can be transferred across various roles and industries. For instance, project management, problem-solving, or leadership skills. Fields of Knowledge: This petal captures specific knowledge areas you’re interested in or have a deep understanding of. This could be anything from technology to psychology or even history. Level of Responsibility: This petal evaluates your desire for responsibility. Are you seeking a leadership role, or do you prefer a supportive, team member role? Salary and Level of Lifestyle: Here you outline your financial goals and the lifestyle you aim for. It includes considerations like desired salary, job benefits, and work-life balance. Values and Goals: This final petal is about your personal values and life goals, aligning your career with your moral compass and long-term aspirations. Each petal is equally important, and the final image should give you a holistic view of your career preferences and strengths. The objective of the Flower Petal Exercise is to help you understand yourself better, providing a clear vision of your career path and enabling you to make more informed decisions in your professional life.\nIt is important to remember that the exercise is not a one-time thing. Your ‘flower’ is expected to change and evolve as you grow, learn, and experience more in your life and career.\nOK, now on to my results!\nMy Preferred Kinds of People to Work With Reliable and dependable Honest, people of integrity Looking for and open to ways of improving Have a sense of humor Flexible, limited but purposeful supervision My “Holland Code”: I like to spend time and work with the following kinds of people:\nInvestigative Enterprising Conventional (My personal Holland combination is Investigative, Artistic, and Social.)\nMy Favorite Working Conditions Quiet (and cool…not too hot!) My own dedicated workspace with space to store books, writing supplies, etc. Relatively casual, comfortable Has a window, natural light, view of trees/nature—with easy walking nearby Flexible hours My Favorite Transferable Skills (What I Can Do and Love to Do) Use my brain Solve problems Develop, improve Follow through, get things done Research, examine, inspect, compare, see similarities and differences Study, observe Communicate well, in writing Communicate well, in person Initiate, lead, be a pioneer Instruct; Teach, tutor, or train My Strongest Traits Competent Knowledgeable Versatile Innovative Resourceful Dependable, Reliable, and Responsible Deliberate Achievement-oriented Self-motivated, driven Effective My Favorite Knowledges or Fields of Interest Learning, research, thinking Writing and editing Biblical and theological studies Habits and productivity Leadership Responsibility \u0026 Salary I’d like to work as the head of a team.\nSalary Range: $60K-90K/year + healthcare, sick leave, vacation, and retirement/401K\nOther rewards hoped for:\nadventure, leadership, helping others, influence My Preferred Kinds of Places to Live Cool Quiet, low traffic Nature, walkable Diverse restaurants, coffee shops, craft beer, etc. Good schools Low crime My Goal, Purpose, or Mission in Life I want to serve the world by serving the church.

<li><strong>Fields of Knowledge</strong>: This petal captures specific knowledge areas you’re interested in or have a deep understanding of. This could be anything from technology to psychology or even history.</li>
<li><strong>Level of Responsibility</strong>: This petal evaluates your desire for responsibility. Are you seeking a leadership role, or do you prefer a supportive, team member role?</li>
<li><strong>Salary and Level of Lifestyle</strong>: Here you outline your financial goals and the lifestyle you aim for. It includes considerations like desired salary, job benefits, and work-life balance.</li>
<li><strong>Values and Goals</strong>: This final petal is about your personal values and life goals, aligning your career with your moral compass and long-term aspirations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each petal is equally important, and the final image should give you a holistic view of your career preferences and strengths. The objective of the Flower Petal Exercise is to help you understand yourself better, providing a clear vision of your career path and enabling you to make more informed decisions in your professional life.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the exercise is not a one-time thing. Your ‘flower’ is expected to change and evolve as you grow, learn, and experience more in your life and career.</p>
