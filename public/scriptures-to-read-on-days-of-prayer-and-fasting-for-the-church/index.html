<p>Shout out, do not hold back!<br>
Lift up your voice like a trumpet!<br>
Announce to my people their rebellion,<br>
to the house of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p>Yet day after day they seek me<br>
and delight to know my ways,<br>
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness<br>
and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;<br>
they ask of me righteous judgments,<br>
they delight to draw near to God.</p>
<p>“Why do we fast, but you do not see?<br>
Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?”</p>
<p>Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day,<br>
and oppress all your workers.</p>
<p>Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight<br>
and to strike with a wicked fist.</p>
<p>Such fasting as you do today<br>
will not make your voice heard on high.</p>
<p>Is such the fast that I choose,<br>
a day to humble oneself?</p>
<p>Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush,<br>
and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?</p>
<p>Will you call this a fast,<br>
a day acceptable to the LORD?</p>
<p>Is not this the fast that I choose:<br>
to loose the bonds of injustice,<br>
to undo the thongs of the yoke,<br>
to let the oppressed go free,<br>
and to break every yoke?</p>
<p>Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,<br>
and bring the homeless poor into your house;<br>
when you see the naked, to cover them,<br>
and not to hide yourself from your own kin?</p>
<p>Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,<br>
and your healing shall spring up quickly;<br>
your vindicator shall go before you,<br>
the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.</p>
<p>Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;<br>
you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.</p>
<p>If you remove the yoke from among you,<br>
the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,<br>
if you offer your food to the hungry<br>
and satisfy the needs of the afflicted,<br>
then your light shall rise in the darkness<br>
and your gloom be like the noonday.</p>
<p>The LORD will guide you continually,<br>
and satisfy your needs in parched places,<br>
and make your bones strong;<br>
and you shall be like a watered garden,<br>
like a spring of water,<br>
whose waters never fail.</p>
<p>Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;<br>
you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;<br>
you shall be called the repairer of the breach,<br>
the restorer of streets to live in.</p>
<p>If you refrain from trampling the sabbath,<br>
from pursuing your own interests on my holy day;<br>
if you call the sabbath a delight<br>
and the holy day of the LORD honorable;<br>
if you honor it, not going your own ways,<br>
serving your own interests, or pursuing your own affairs;<br>
then you shall take delight in the LORD,<br>
and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth;<br>
I will feed you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob,<br>
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p>
<h2 id="ezekiel-34116">Ezekiel 34:1–16<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ezekiel-34116">#</a></h2>
<p>The word of the LORD came to me:</p>
<p>Mortal, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy, and say to them—to the shepherds:</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>
<p>Ah, you shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?</p>
<p>You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep.</p>
<p>You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them.</p>
<p>So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.</p>
<p>My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with no one to search or seek for them.</p>
<p>Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild animals, since there was no shepherd; and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep;</p>
<p>therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord GOD, I am against the shepherds; and I will demand my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer shall the shepherds feed themselves.</p>
<p>I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, so that they may not be food for them.</p>
<p>For thus says the Lord GOD:</p>
<p>I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep.</p>
<p>I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.</p>
<p>I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land.</p>
<p>I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.</p>
<p>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak,</p>
<p>but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.</p>
