<meta name="description" content="I know I’m not alone in this, but the past few years have been pretty rough for me.

I’ve gained at least 50 pounds.
I had a fun part-time gig as a managing editor come to an end.
I’ve come to terms with some long-term depression and anxiety.
I had a job offer ripped out from under me.
I hit pause on and eventually dropped out of my Ph.D. program.
I’ve resigned from ordained ministry in the ACNA, my previous denomination.

Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.">
