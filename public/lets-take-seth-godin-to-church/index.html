No! Of course you’re not indispensable. What use could this crap possibly be to the Church, or to me – simultaneously a pastor and a pastor-in-training.
Then, however, I read the book. And I suggest you do, too!

This time, the opportunity is to bring your best self to the marketplace and be rewarded for it (vii).\nFor the past few generations, we’ve grown used to the implicit deal: If you go to school, learn how to follow instructions, work hard, and show up on time, we’ll take care of you.\nBut, at least in many sectors, the bargain has fallen apart.\nSo, Godin advises us to become linchpins in whatever industry we find ourselves. We must treat our work as art, and combine a variety of skills to address complex situations.\nWe must be able to figure out what to do next, without it being spelled out for us in an instruction manual.\nOK, great. But what does this have to do with CHURCH? I believe pastors are uniquely situated to be linchpins. They are the leaders of a largely volunteer organization. And, Pastoral Epistles notwithstanding, there is no instruction manual (God forbid we treat the Bible like an instruction manual!).\nSo they must treat their work as art.

What if churches were known for showing artful, personal, and prodigal love to their communities, without expectation of increased attendance on a Sunday morning?\nWhat if we were seeker-sensitive, without selling out to the “latest” corporate and marketing strategies (which, often enough, rely upon the old paradigm)?\nWhat if, especially in North America, we stopped complaining about “persecution,” and started creatively taking advantage of the situations in which we find ourselves?\nI don’t have all the answers to these questions, but I’m convinced they’re worth asking!\nGodin is convinced that people are starving for personal connection in a world filled with faceless factories and multinational corporations.
