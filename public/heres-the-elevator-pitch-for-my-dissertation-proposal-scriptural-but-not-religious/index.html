<p>Here’s the “elevator pitch” for the dissertation. Feedback appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="scriptural-but-not-religious-barth-bonhoeffer-and-a-biblical-critique-of-religion">Scriptural, but Not Religious: Barth, Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#scriptural-but-not-religious-barth-bonhoeffer-and-a-biblical-critique-of-religion">#</a></h2>
<p>My project traces its origins to a single classroom discussion question in the Spring of 2015. The question was this: “In what ways is Bonhoeffer’s understanding of religion similar to, and different from, that of Barth?”</p>
<p>Although we only spent a few minutes on that question in class, it’s been on my mind ever since.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s the reason I’m defending this dissertation proposal today — not because I’ve found the perfect answer to the question, but rather because I think I’ve found a better way to approach the question.</p>
<p>You see, every discussion of the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship that I’ve read eventually gets around to discussing the similarities and differences between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s critical understandings of religion. And rightly so, because this is the most confusing aspect of their relationship to explain.</p>
<p>Why does Bonhoeffer in prison, after adopting Barth’s theological critique of religion as idolatrous unbelief…<br>
Why does Bonhoeffer, after claiming that the critique of religion was Barth’s greatest merit and original contribution as a theologian…<br>
Why does Bonhoeffer say that Barth left us with nothing more than a “positivism of revelation” — a flattening of doctrines to the same relative importance, as a result of which the world is left to its own devices — whatever that means!<br>
Why does Bonhoeffer then speak approvingly of a “religionless Christianity,” something that Barth explicitly refused to support?</p>
<p>This is the central mystery, as it were, of the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship.</p>
<p>So far, scholars have attempted to solve it either by (1) proposing theological frameworks to explain Barth and Bonhoeffer’s differences, or by (2) proposing explanations of just what Bonhoeffer meant by the “positivism of revelation.”</p>
<p>I do not mean to discount the work that’s been done already in these two areas. However, instead of proposing a theological framework or an explanation of “positivism of revelation,” I want to examine the connection between these two theologians’ critiques of religion and their use of Scripture.</p>
