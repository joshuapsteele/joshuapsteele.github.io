Prayers for the Sick
For a Sick Person
O Father of mercies and God of all comfort, our only help in time of need: We humbly beseech thee to behold, visit, and relieve thy sick servant N. for whom our prayers are desired. Look upon him with the eyes of thy mercy; comfort him with a sense of thy goodness; preserve him from the temptations of the enemy; and give him patience under his affliction. In thy good time, restore him to health, and enable him to lead the residue of his life in thy fear, and to thy glory; and grant that finally he may dwell with thee in life everlasting; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."><meta name=author content="joshuapsteele"><link rel=canonical href=https://joshuapsteele.com/prayers-for-the-sick/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.1d3078ba3408f1410cbc7d07f412ada5ed26271bb27c7c601a7d46da382b440c.css integrity="sha256-HTB4ujQI8UEMvH0H9BKtpe0mJxuyfHxgGn1G2jgrRAw=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://joshuapsteele.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://joshuapsteele.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://joshuapsteele.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://joshuapsteele.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://joshuapsteele.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://joshuapsteele.com/prayers-for-the-sick/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://joshuapsteele.com/css/extended/custom.min.29813e946f92d51ad1f386ece6488324ef1119fbc7e73c5677ff6ccb8f4dfd82.css integrity="sha256-KYE+lG+S1RrR84bs5kiDJO8RGfvH5zxWd/9sy49N/YI="><link rel=preload href=https://joshuapsteele.com/images/default-social.png as=image><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.googleapis.com crossorigin><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.gstatic.com crossorigin><link rel=dns-prefetch href=//cdn.jsdelivr.net><link rel=dns-prefetch href=//github.com><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://joshuapsteele.com/prayers-for-the-sick/"><meta property="og:title" content="Prayers for the Sick | Joshua P.

Amen.\nIn Pain Lord Jesus Christ, by your patience in suffering you hallowed earthly pain and gave us the example of obedience to your Father’s will: Be near me in my time of weakness and pain; sustain me by your grace, that my strength and courage may not fail; heal me according to your will; and help me always to believe that what happens to me here is of little account if you hold me in eternal life, my Lord and my God. Amen.\nFor Sleep O heavenly Father, you give your children sleep for the refreshing of soul and body: Grant me this gift, I pray; keep me in that perfect peace which you have promised to those whose minds are fixed on you; and give me such a sense of your presence, that in the hours of silence I may enjoy the blessed assurance of your love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\nIn the Morning This is another day, O Lord. I know not what it will bring forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I am to stand up, help me to stand bravely. If I am to sit still, help me to sit quietly. If I am to lie low, help me to do it patiently. And if I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly. Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit of Jesus. Amen.\n","wordCount":"1045","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pexels-photo-9486689-1568x1047.jpeg","datePublished":"2024-04-23T23:15:40Z","dateModified":"2025-03-31T16:22:26-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"joshuapsteele"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://joshuapsteele.com/prayers-for-the-sick/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Joshua P.
