<p>Now, (1) does this mean that we’re to always play the scapegoat, even when the problems aren’t directly our fault? (2) Wouldn’t this open us up to the risk of ignoring the persecution of others by corrupt and power-hungry leaders within the Church?</p>
<p>(1) No, because (2) yes, it potentially could.</p>
<p>What I’m getting at, however, is that <strong>we must always be willing to admit that the Church’s biggest flaws find their roots in the fact that every single churchman and churchwoman is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sinner</span>.</strong></p>
<p>And let’s not kid ourselves – we’re sinners not in the vague, abstract sense of having broken an esoteric list of rules. We are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>concrete sinners</strong></span>, each corrupt, selfish, and violent.</p>
<p>The moment we attempt to distance ourselves from “those sinners over there,” we open ourselves to the risk of committing the very worst sins against others – within and without the Church.</p>
<p>Only when we Christians begin to take ownership for the failings of the Church (of which we are a part) can the Church adopt its most successful posture: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>repentance</strong></em></span>.</p>

<p>I’m frustrated with the Church, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I’m</strong></span> the problem.</p>
