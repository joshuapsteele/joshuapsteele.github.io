<p>I’m convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 –</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Eccl-7-2" id="en-NIV-17432">It is better to go to a house of mourning</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">than to go to a house of feasting,</span></span><br>
<span class="text Eccl-7-2">for death is the destiny of everyone;</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">the living should take this to heart.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, obviously, simply taking death to heart isn’t enough to defeat our most ancient enemy. For that, we need (and have been given) a <em><strong>resurrection</strong></em>.</p>
<p>But, have you taken your own death to heart? I believe there’s something to be gained by considering how you’d like to be remembered by others after you die.</p>
