<meta name="description" content="The Table Saw
I know you&rsquo;ve all been waiting for (lol) updates on my vintage 1947 Craftsman 113 table saw.
I&rsquo;m happy to report that, after disassembling and cleaning the saw, I was able to put it back together and get it running again!

In the process, I installed:

A new power toggle switch on the motor housing
A safety ON/OFF switch for the front of the saw (where you stand)
An 8-inch thin-kerf combination blade
A 6-inch motor pulley to replace the original 3-inch pulley (this was recommended in the manual since the motor is a 1750 RPM motor, not a 3450 RPM motor)
An adjustable linked v-belt
Some larger caster wheels for the base of the saw

The rip fence provided some extra challenges, mainly because I accidentally broke the cam/clamp handle that holds the fence in place. I originally repaired the handle with some J-B Weld &ldquo;SteelStik&rdquo; epoxy putty, which seemed strong and promising at first.">

<p>I know you&rsquo;ve all been waiting for (lol) updates on my <a href="/vintage-craftsman-table-saw/">vintage 1947 Craftsman 113 table saw</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that, after disassembling and cleaning the saw, I was able to put it back together and get it running again!</p>
<p><img alt="Refurbished Craftsman Table Saw" loading="lazy" src="/refurbished-table-saw.jpeg"></p>
<p>In the process, I installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <a href="https://amzn.to/3QVf5mv">power toggle switch</a> on the motor housing</li>
<li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4hXfz6C">safety ON/OFF switch for the front of the saw</a> (where you stand)</li>
<li>An <a href="https://amzn.to/4iNvCF7">8-inch thin-kerf combination blade</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4cxyiEV">6-inch motor pulley</a> to replace the original 3-inch pulley (this was recommended in the manual since the motor is a 1750 RPM motor, not a 3450 RPM motor)</li>
<li>An <a href="https://amzn.to/41UHzmI">adjustable linked v-belt</a></li>
<li>Some <a href="https://amzn.to/43upo8x">larger caster wheels</a> for the base of the saw</li>
</ul>
<p>The rip fence provided some extra challenges, mainly because I accidentally broke the cam/clamp handle that holds the fence in place. I originally repaired the handle with some <a href="https://amzn.to/42AkfKb">J-B Weld &ldquo;SteelStik&rdquo; epoxy putty</a>, which seemed strong and promising at first.</p>
<p><img alt="Attempted cam handle repair" loading="lazy" src="/rip-fence-handle-epoxy.jpeg"></p>
<p>However, when screwing the rip fence components back into place, which took some force due to rusted threads, the cam handle fell apart again.</p>
<p>Shout-out to my friend Doug, who suggested cleaning-up the threads with a tap and die kit.

<p>So, the saw is running pretty well now. I just need to get used to using a table saw (I have a pretty healthy fear of kickback), and figure out what I&rsquo;m going to make!</p>

<p>I bought this <a href="https://amzn.to/3DZtFqe">Milescraft saw safety bundle</a>, which includes a feather board and two different pushers.</p>
<p>Last year, I bought a <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/power-tools/power-saws/miter/12-in-dual-bevel-sliding-compound-miter-saw-with-precision-led-shadow-guide-56682.html">Hercules Miter Saw from Harbor Freight Tools</a> in order to install some baseboard trim throughout my house. I haven&rsquo;t used it much since, but it&rsquo;s still going strong and it&rsquo;s nice to have a chop saw ready to go for cross cuts.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m already invested in the Bauer cordless power tool line from Harbor Freight, and they had a &ldquo;buy a batter and charger and get a tool for free&rdquo; deal going, I bought a <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/20v-brushless-cordless-7-14-in-circular-saw-tool-only-59281.html">Bauer brushless cordless circular saw</a>. So far, I love it. Way nicer than the $20 Chicago Electric corded circular saw (also from HF!) that I&rsquo;ve had for years.</p>
