They leave unexamined the question of what to do when the phenomenon of concordance might be turned against thematics, to undermine it — to deconstruct it. One man’s exegesis is, however, another’s deconstruction. A concordant translation of a text might serve equally to reveal Aichele’s ‘defects and problems’ or Ryken’s ‘full exegetical potential’ — to reinforce its ‘intention’, or to undermine it.

I’ve just finished the latter, and hope to write my review in the next day or two. However, I’d like to share the following quotes on <em>Deconstructive Literalism</em> and <em>The Perfect Translation</em>, because I find the concepts intriguing as a student of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence">Eugene Nida’s dynamic or functional equivalence</a> (when it comes to both NT Greek and modern Spanish), and a newcomer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_theory">relevance theory</a>, which Goodwin uses to provide a way forward in the shadow of the KJV tradition. More on that later. In the meantime:</p>
<p>“What <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Control-Biblical-Meaning-Mechanism/dp/B008SLHBC8">Aichele</a> has noticed is that <strong>if the interpreter wants to ‘see’ the source text, he or she would prefer not to have another interpreter standing in the way.

The translation represents an ideological undertaking which <em>itself</em> can be readily deconstructed, but does not provide access to the source. (207-8).</p>

<p>“Now, of course <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Word-God-English-Translation/dp/1581344643">Ryken and Collins</a>, whilst advocating concordant translation on the one hand, also desire, on the other hand, to maintain the control over meaning to which Aichele refers, by implicitly linking concordance to thematics.

<p>“The perfect translation is the one whose relationship to a source text is such that it <strong>permits both the construction of the releveant interpretation of that text, and its deconstruction</strong>.” (209).</p>
