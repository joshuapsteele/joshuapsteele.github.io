<p>The main reason for the trip was to visit some good friends of ours, the Smith family, in Phoenix, AZ. Here’s a picture of the group of us together after church at <a href="https://livingfaithanglican.org/">Living Faith Anglican Church in Tempe, AZ</a>, where my friend Peter Smith is the rector.</p>

</p>
<p>The trip was a blast. It was great to catch up with the Smiths and to see their new home and church in Arizona.</p>
<p>Plus, we got to go hiking at (1) Saguaro Lake,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3618-1024x768.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>(2) Cathedral Rock in Sedona,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3663.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>and (3) the South Kaibab Trail at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3743.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>(That last photo is my favorite from the entire trip. Thanks to the random guy on the trail who took it for us!)</p>
<p>Having never been to the Southwest before, I was frequently overwhelmed by the beauty of the views and the landscape. At certain points, it didn’t even feel real.</p>

<p>We’d love it, wouldn’t we, if the most beautiful things/experiences were always safe. But they aren’t.</p>
<p>There’s frequently risk and danger involved in life’s most beautiful and meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that we ought to live life recklessly, with no concern for the risks and dangers involved!</p>
<p>But it is a good reminder that we are, perhaps, more concerned with safety and risk-mitigation than God is.</p>
