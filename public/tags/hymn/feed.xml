      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&amp;rdquo; has long been one of my favorite hymns. This Advent, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write some additional verses. They emphasize God&amp;rsquo;s heart for the poor and the powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the Bible looking for these themes, they show up almost everywhere. However, in particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn from Leviticus 25, Psalm 113, Isaiah 58, Amos 5, Luke 1, and Luke 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O come, Defender of the weak,&lt;br&gt;
Teach us their welfare first to seek.&lt;br&gt;
May widow, orphan, refugee&lt;br&gt;
Find rest within Thy jubilee!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>O come, Defender of the weak,<br>
Teach us their welfare first to seek.<br>
May widow, orphan, refugee<br>
Find rest within Thy jubilee!</p>
<p>O come, Avenger of the poor,<br>
And open wide redemption&rsquo;s door.<br>
Undo the yoke, break every chain,<br>
And with Thee in Thy kingdom let them reign!</p>
<p>O come, Sustainer of the least,<br>
And lift them to Thy heavenly feast.<br>
Cast down the mighty from their seat,<br>
And fill the hungry with good things to eat!</p>
<p>O come, O Voice of Prophets bold,<br>
And bring the Day Thy saints foretold.<br>
Let justice roll like waters down,<br>
And righteousness for all abound!</p>
