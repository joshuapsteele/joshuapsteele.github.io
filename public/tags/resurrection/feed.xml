      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Holy Week and Easter coming up, I’ve been thinking about music and artwork that I’ve found particularly poignant when reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’ve seen many icons of the resurrection (“anastasis,” in Greek) like the one below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think I fully appreciated the image until I realized it was Adam and Eve that Christ is helping up out of their graves. He’s trampled down the doors/gates of Hell and is taking an elderly Adam and an elderly Eve by the hand. Rescuing them from the realm of Death, in order to bring them back to eternal life with God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Second, I’ve long appreciated “Death in His Grave” by John Mark McMillan as a reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.</p>

<p>By John Mark McMillan</p>
<p>Though the Earth Cried out for blood<br>
Satisfied her hunger was<br>
Her billows calmed on raging seas<br>
For the souls on men she craved</p>
<p>Sun and moon from balcony<br>
Turned their head in disbelief<br>
Their precious Love would taste the sting<br>
Disfigured and disdained</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke with keys<br>
Of Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>So three days in darkness slept<br>
The Morning Sun of righteousness<br>
But rose to shame the throes of death<br>
And over turn his rule</p>
<p>Now daughters and the sons of men<br>
Would pay not their dues again<br>
The debt of blood they owed was rent<br>
When the day rolled a new</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke holding keys<br>
To Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke with keys<br>
Of Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>He has cheated<br>
Hell and seated<br>
Us above the fall<br>
In desperate places<br>
He paid our wages<br>
One time once and for all</p>
