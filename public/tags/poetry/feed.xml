<p>O come, Defender of the weak,<br>
Teach us their welfare first to seek.<br>
May widow, orphan, refugee<br>
Find rest within Thy jubilee!</p>
<p>O come, Avenger of the poor,<br>
And open wide redemption&rsquo;s door.<br>
Undo the yoke, break every chain,<br>
And with Thee in Thy kingdom let them reign!</p>
<p>O come, Sustainer of the least,<br>
And lift them to Thy heavenly feast.<br>
Cast down the mighty from their seat,<br>
And fill the hungry with good things to eat!</p>
<p>O come, O Voice of Prophets bold,<br>
And bring the Day Thy saints foretold.<br>
Let justice roll like waters down,<br>
And righteousness for all abound!</p>

&lt;p>In case you didn’t know, the “traditional” wedding vows – in English, at least – are found in the &lt;a href="http://www.bcponline.org/">Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/baskerville.htm">1662 Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a>, the marriage vows read as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
&lt;strong>from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love and to cheriſh, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-traditional-wedding-vows">The Traditional Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>In case you didn’t know, the “traditional” wedding vows – in English, at least – are found in the <a href="http://www.bcponline.org/">Book of Common Prayer</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/baskerville.htm">1662 Book of Common Prayer</a>, the marriage vows read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,</strong><br>
<strong>from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love and to cheriſh, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I N. take thee M. to my wedded huſband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love, cheriſh, and to obey, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>When we got married in August 2012, my wife, Rachel, and I decided to write our own vows, at least loosely based upon the traditional vows. (Give us a break, we weren’t yet Anglicans!)</p>
<p>So, here are the vows I wrote, and still endeavor to keep as Rachel’s husband!</p>
<h1 id="my-wedding-vows">My Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>I, Joshua Patrick Steele, pledge myself to you, Rachel Elizabeth, as your husband.</p>
<p>I solemnly vow:</p>
<p>to love you as I have been loved by Love himself,</p>
<p>to take joy daily in your beauty and worth as God’s precious daughter,</p>
<p>to cling to you faithfully with mind, soul, and body,</p>
<p>in light and in darkness,</p>
<p>in summer and in winter,</p>
<p>in springtime and in harvest,</p>
<p>in plenty and in famine,</p>
<p>through Sheol to Eden,</p>
<p>in sickly decay and in healthy vigor,</p>
<p>in unspeakable joy and in bitter sorrow,</p>
<p>in the tempests of chaos and in the calms of perfect peace.</p>
<p>And, by your side, to pursue relentlessly God’s grace and shalom</p>
<p>until Death parts us</p>
<p>or Death itself is vanquished by our coming King,</p>
<p>in whose presence I hereto pledge you my faithfulness.</p>

<h2 id="from-a-grateful-son--a-poem-for-my-mother">From a Grateful Son – A Poem for My Mother</h2>
<p>Thank you, Mom, for having me<br>
that day so long ago.<br>
Thank you, then, for holding me<br>
and now for letting go.<br>
Thank you, Mom, for giving me<br>
your patience, time, and care.<br>
And thank you, Mom, for loving me<br>
for always being there –</p>
<p>Thanks so much for teaching me<br>
both how to read and write.<br>
For every single grueling day<br>
and every sleepless night.<br>
Thank you, Mom, for aiming high,<br>
for helping me succeed.<br>
For never letting me forget<br>
that you believe in me.</p>
<p>Mom, you mean so much to me.<br>
My words cannot convey<br>
The debt of love, of care-filled work<br>
That I should rightly pay.<br>
Though distance, time, and life itself<br>
may take me far away,<br>
I’ll always be your little boy<br>
with these three words to say –</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
