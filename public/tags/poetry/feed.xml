      <title>O Come, O Come, Emmanuel: Extra Verses</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&amp;rdquo; has long been one of my favorite hymns. This Advent, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write some additional verses. They emphasize God&amp;rsquo;s heart for the poor and the powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the Bible looking for these themes, they show up almost everywhere. However, in particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn from Leviticus 25, Psalm 113, Isaiah 58, Amos 5, Luke 1, and Luke 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O come, Defender of the weak,&lt;br&gt;
Teach us their welfare first to seek.&lt;br&gt;
May widow, orphan, refugee&lt;br&gt;
Find rest within Thy jubilee!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

May widow, orphan, refugee<br>
Find rest within Thy jubilee!</p>
<p>O come, Avenger of the poor,<br>
And open wide redemption&rsquo;s door.<br>
Undo the yoke, break every chain,<br>
And with Thee in Thy kingdom let them reign!</p>
<p>O come, Sustainer of the least,<br>
And lift them to Thy heavenly feast.<br>
Cast down the mighty from their seat,<br>
And fill the hungry with good things to eat!</p>
<p>O come, O Voice of Prophets bold,<br>
And bring the Day Thy saints foretold.<br>
Let justice roll like waters down,<br>
And righteousness for all abound!</p>

      <title>Wedding Vows: My Personal Take on the Traditional Version</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/wedding-vows/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-traditional-wedding-vows&#34;&gt;The Traditional Wedding Vows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn‚Äôt know, the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù wedding vows ‚Äì in English, at least ‚Äì are found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bcponline.org/&#34;&gt;Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/baskerville.htm&#34;&gt;1662 Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, the marriage vows read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;from this day forward, for better for wor≈øe, for richer for poorer, in ≈øickne≈øs and in health, to love and to cheri≈øh, till death us do part, according to God‚Äôs holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-traditional-wedding-vows">The Traditional Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>In case you didn‚Äôt know, the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù wedding vows ‚Äì in English, at least ‚Äì are found in the <a href="http://www.bcponline.org/">Book of Common Prayer</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/baskerville.htm">1662 Book of Common Prayer</a>, the marriage vows read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,</strong><br>
<strong>from this day forward, for better for wor≈øe, for richer for poorer, in ≈øickne≈øs and in health, to love and to cheri≈øh, till death us do part, according to God‚Äôs holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I N. take thee M. to my wedded hu≈øband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for wor≈øe, for richer for poorer, in ≈øickne≈øs and in health, to love, cheri≈øh, and to obey, till death us do part, according to God‚Äôs holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we got married in August 2012, my wife, Rachel, and I decided to write our own vows, at least loosely based upon the traditional vows. (Give us a break, we weren‚Äôt yet Anglicans!)</p>
<p>So, here are the vows I wrote, and still endeavor to keep as Rachel‚Äôs husband!</p>
<h1 id="my-wedding-vows">My Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>I, Joshua Patrick Steele, pledge myself to you, Rachel Elizabeth, as your husband.</p>
<p>I solemnly vow:</p>
<p>to love you as I have been loved by Love himself,</p>
<p>to take joy daily in your beauty and worth as God‚Äôs precious daughter,</p>
<p>to cling to you faithfully with mind, soul, and body,</p>
<p>in light and in darkness,</p>
<p>in summer and in winter,</p>
<p>in springtime and in harvest,</p>
<p>in plenty and in famine,</p>
<p>through Sheol to Eden,</p>
<p>in sickly decay and in healthy vigor,</p>
<p>in unspeakable joy and in bitter sorrow,</p>
<p>in the tempests of chaos and in the calms of perfect peace.</p>
<p>And, by your side, to pursue relentlessly God‚Äôs grace and shalom</p>
<p>until Death parts us</p>
<p>or Death itself is vanquished by our coming King,</p>
<p>in whose presence I hereto pledge you my faithfulness.</p>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-a-grateful-son--a-poem-for-my-mother&#34;&gt;From a Grateful Son ‚Äì A Poem for My Mother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Mom, for having me&lt;br&gt;
that day so long ago.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you, then, for holding me&lt;br&gt;
and now for letting go.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you, Mom, for giving me&lt;br&gt;
your patience, time, and care.&lt;br&gt;
And thank you, Mom, for loving me&lt;br&gt;
for always being there ‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="from-a-grateful-son--a-poem-for-my-mother">From a Grateful Son ‚Äì A Poem for My Mother</h2>
<p>Thank you, Mom, for having me<br>
that day so long ago.<br>
Thank you, then, for holding me<br>
and now for letting go.<br>
Thank you, Mom, for giving me<br>
your patience, time, and care.<br>
And thank you, Mom, for loving me<br>
for always being there ‚Äì</p>
<p>Thanks so much for teaching me<br>
both how to read and write.<br>
For every single grueling day<br>
and every sleepless night.<br>
Thank you, Mom, for aiming high,<br>
for helping me succeed.<br>
For never letting me forget<br>
that you believe in me.</p>
<p>Mom, you mean so much to me.<br>
My words cannot convey<br>
The debt of love, of care-filled work<br>
That I should rightly pay.<br>
Though distance, time, and life itself<br>
may take me far away,<br>
I‚Äôll always be your little boy<br>
with these three words to say ‚Äì</p>
<p>‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù</p>
