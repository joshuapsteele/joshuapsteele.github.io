      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer, I’ve spent most of my reading/writing time working on a paper on Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 10. This paper is for the 2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium, and it has taken &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; longer than I originally anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I get to use this paper in my dissertation? I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I got excited, because, in my work on Genesis 1–3 last school year, I discovered some differences in how Barth and Bonhoeffer handled Genesis 1–3 vis-a-vis the subsequent history of Israel. Namely, while &lt;em&gt;Barth&lt;/em&gt; takes care to work his way from Eden to the Church only after moving through the history of Israel and Jesus, &lt;em&gt;Bonhoeffer&lt;/em&gt; jumps right from Eden to the Church via Christ. This difference in what I’m provisionally calling “Christological immediacy”—which is perhaps a confessional one that parallels some of the exegetical differences between Calvin and Luther—has me wondering whether Barth and Bonhoeffer differed in important ways on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer, I’ve spent most of my reading/writing time working on a paper on Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 10. This paper is for the 2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium, and it has taken <em>way</em> longer than I originally anticipated.</p>
<p>Will I get to use this paper in my dissertation? I’m not sure.</p>
<p>At first, I got excited, because, in my work on Genesis 1–3 last school year, I discovered some differences in how Barth and Bonhoeffer handled Genesis 1–3 vis-a-vis the subsequent history of Israel. Namely, while <em>Barth</em> takes care to work his way from Eden to the Church only after moving through the history of Israel and Jesus, <em>Bonhoeffer</em> jumps right from Eden to the Church via Christ. This difference in what I’m provisionally calling “Christological immediacy”—which is perhaps a confessional one that parallels some of the exegetical differences between Calvin and Luther—has me wondering whether Barth and Bonhoeffer differed in important ways on Israel.</p>
<p>If so, then perhaps a chapter devoted to their readings of Romans 9–11 would be in order! However, while Barth wrote about Romans 9–11 at least three different times (<em>Römerbrief</em>, <em>Shorter Commentary</em>, <em>CD</em> II/2), the closest that Bonhoeffer came to a lengthy exegesis of the passage was in his “Exposition on Romans 9–11 (Student Notes), Finkenwalde, September 28, 1935” (DBWE 14:868ff.). All we have are the following student notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 9–11 Jewish Problem <a href="#">Judenproblem</a></p>
<p>Who is a Jew? Israel according to the flesh?</p>
<p>Chapters 8 to 9: concept of “election.” Jews “brothers,” 9:5 only passage where Christ is called God.</p>
<p>Verses 6–13 The children of Israel are not = σπέρμα but rather only those of the promise (not Ishmael, but rather Isaac). The σπέρμα does nothing, but rather the word of God that comes to the σπέρμα.</p>
<p>Verses 1–5 who: according to the flesh, who have the promises etc. Israel according to the flesh has received all [gifts] of the promise. Israelites, however, are only children of the promise. Only the elect, however, are children of the promise. They are children not through the σπέρμα but through election. But as the elect from the σπέρμα Ἀβραάμ. The real basis is election. The epistemological basis: σπέρμα. Not because they receive the kingdom of God. But rather as those who have come along, belong to it. Luke 19 … because he too is of the seed of Abraham.</p>
<p>Verses 14ff. Further: hardness of heart. Traced back to nothing but God’s. Hardness of heart traced back to election (cf. verse 12 Luther’s addition “by the grace of the one who calls,” where the Greek reads simply ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦντος).</p>
<p>Verse 17: Pharaoh’s hardness of heart serves to proclaim God’s glory in all the earth. (Chapter 11 also: Israel’s hardness of heart. God uses the hardness of heart of one person to convert another.) This hardness of heart has one goal: proclamation of the name. Perhaps also an end to it.</p>
<p>Verse 30—chapter 10:3 Here their guilt discussed. The election hardness of heart is at the same time self-incrimination.</p>
<p>Verses 4–8 The word of the gospel was already close to them (the Jews)!</p>
<p>Hardness of heart: 1. God’s will 2. Israel’s guilt 3. Calling of the others.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Rejected? No, not rejected. Proof: he himself. God <a href="#">has</a> not rejected but hardened. λεῖμμα: remnant, new beginning (Elijah).</p>
<p>Verse 11 Have come so that they then stumble? No. Rather, this stumbling took place for the sake of the gentiles. Hardness of heart vicarious representative suffering for the gentiles, not without guilt, in that sense different from the Servant. Notion of vicarious representation remains. But guilt nonetheless.</p>
<p>Why did the Jews have to be hardened so that the gentiles might receive salvation? So that they crucified Christ (and Deutero-Isaiah?). It remains such that Israel is the missionary of the world, suffering in a vicarious representative fashion, and yet nonetheless because of guilt! Cross is culpable hardness of heart, which does not, however, relieve Israel of its mission task.</p>
<p>Vicarious representative action [Stellvertretung]: That means that God does not deviate from his plan. He uses guilt for this purpose. This cannot be understood morally.</p>
<p>Verse 15: Israel’s acceptance will come only with the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Verse 17ff.: If chosen branches have already been broken off, how much more so will a gentile be broken off.</p>
<p>Verse 25ff.: μυστήριον—prophecy.</p>
<p>Verse 28 quite clearly vicarious representative action, guilt, choice remains. God’s will, which is not clear, is carried out with regard to the Jews (election); they remain the beloved of God but ἐχθροί, for their and others’ salvation. Although it must happen (the betrayal), woe to whoever does it!</p>
<p>Now the question: Israel according to the flesh or through nature? or through the law?</p>
<p>What is a Jew? (DBWE 14:868–70).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, quite a bit less to go on than Barth’s handful of lengthy expositions of Romans 9–11!</p>
<p>And yet, Bonhoeffer did preach a sermon on Romans 11:6 (“But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace”) while he was in Barcelona (“Sermon on Romans 11:6, Barcelona, Oculi, March 11, 1928,” DBWE 10:480ff.).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, in a letter to his friend Walter Dreß, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Sunday I preached on Romans 11:6 and in the process realized that my previous understanding of dogmatics is being severely questioned by all these new impressions in a country that has known neither war nor revolution, neither a youth movement nor Spengler. It’s still difficult to articulate these impressions. In any case I now do have serious questions whether Barth could have written in Spain—whether he had any understanding at all for circumstances outside Germany. At the very least, given the circumstances here—both ecclesiastical and political—one really finds oneself forced to reassess one’s theology from the ground up. Just as I already had in Germany a theology of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, so too is the theology of the spring and summer momentarily taking the place of the Berlin winter theology.—Despite all my theological reservations, I read Wittig with a great deal of pleasure. I recommend you and Suse read him together. I’m also planning to get to Barth’s Dogmatics [Die christliche Dogmatik im Entwurf, that is] once more. It’s really worth reading (DBWE 10:76–77).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, before the sermon, Bonhoeffer had written in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My theology is beginning to become humanistic; what does that mean? I wonder whether Barth ever lived abroad? ¶Wittig’s Leben Jesu is making a very strong impression on me. ¶Tomorrow I am to preach here for the first time. I decided on Rom. 11:6 as my text, after having begun to work on many other texts (DBWE 10:64).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding this diary entry and the subsequent sermon, Reinhart Staats wrote (in the Editor’s Afterword to the German Edition of DBWE 10):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement should be understood within its proper context. What he comes to see more clearly is not what separates him from Barth but rather what he fails to find in the leader of the theology of revelation, namely, a humanistic theology focused on the whole world in its history. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Josef Wittig’s book Leben Jesu in Palästina, Schlesien und anderswo, which strongly influenced Bonhoeffer at that time, can also help explain this shift toward a “humanistic” theology. Wittig was a patristics scholar and Catholic writer who was for a time condemned by the Roman Curia for his “modernism.” In this book he presents a modern example of what discipleship to Jesus means, giving the Sermon on the Mount a central role and attesting Christianity’s openness to the world with the inclusion of antiquity: “The priest who is to become a new Paul must have been with Paul in Jerusalem, Athens, and Rome if he is to know how Paul would preach in Berlin.” Finally, even Bonhoeffer’s first sermon in Barcelona on the freely chosen passage Rom. 11:6 can help explain his diary remarks. This sermon addresses one of the basic Christian beliefs regarding grace (Bonhoeffer’s famous book Discipleship will first address the notion of “costly grace” in 1937): It is in God’s own goodness that “our gaze is opened to the entire world.” “Only one thing remains, namely, that God comes to human beings and bestows grace [,] the path from eternity into time, the path of Jesus Christ.” The critique of an ethic of principles that occurs for the first time in the Barcelona texts is thus also to be understood in connection with Bonhoeffer’s new personal experiences. This is “the great moral renewal Jesus brought about, the dismissal of principles.” <strong>The attendant critique of an unclear understanding of “religion” does admittedly correspond largely to Karl Barth’s critique of religion. Still, after Barcelona Bonhoeffer’s own theology is more humanistic, which also means that it is more ecumenical without imposing on his understanding of the Oikumene any institutional ecclesiastical elements</strong> (DBWE 10:627–29, <strong>emphasis added</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, perhaps there’s more going on with Romans 9–11 than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Of course, as far as Barth’s theological critique of religion goes, Romans 7 is more central than Romans 9–11. But, again, Bonhoeffer doesn’t have much to say about Romans 7, at least not in the form of a lengthy exposition. Nevertheless, for both Romans 7 and 9–11, Bonhoeffer might just have enough scattered mentions of the passages to make an interesting comparison of his and Barth’s exegesis of those passages possible.</p>
<p>The search continues!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: Here is the paper that I gave at the 2019 Karl Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at the Center for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#post-41871-footnote-1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#post-41871-footnote-2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>UPDATE: Here is the paper that I gave at the 2019 Karl Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at the Center for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church">INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”</h2>
<p>On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></sup> He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.</p>
<p>Of course, the very worst thing about supersessionism is that it implies that God is faithless and fickle. The next-worst thing about supersessionism is that it’s only a short step away from antisemitism and anti-Judaism. And yet, if Barth’s goal and our own is to interpret the book of Romans by ascertaining what Paul thought and spoke “in general and in detail,”<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup> then the worst thing about Barth’s somewhat supersessionist Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is not his equation of “Israel” with the “Church,” but rather his equation of “Gentiles” with the “world.” When it comes to Römerbrief chapter 10, there are actually good reasons for Barth to apply Romans 9:30–10:21 to the guilt of the Church, instead of Israel. However, glossing Paul’s “Gentiles” as the “world” makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pick up on Paul’s pastoral handling of the tensions between Jews and Gentiles within the Church. Paul is talking about the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians, whereas Barth is talking about the relationship between the Church and the world.</p>
<p>In order to make this point, I will first summarize Barth’s argument in Römerbrief 10, before assessing its strengths and weaknesses as an interpretation of Romans 10.</p>
<h2 id="summary-what-barth-is-doing-in-römerbrief-10">SUMMARY: WHAT BARTH IS DOING IN RÖMERBRIEF 10</h2>
<h3 id="the-krisis-of-knowledge-romans-930103-with-great-revelation-comes-great-culpabilitysup4post-41871-footnote-4sup">The KRISIS of Knowledge (Romans 9:30–10:3): With Great Revelation Comes Great Culpability<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></h3>
<p>The knowledge in question is the knowledge of God and the crisis is the judgment that humans are guilty. In fact, the crisis of knowledge is that both avoiding and pursuing the knowledge of God lead to guilt. <em>Avoiding</em> the knowledge of God <em>increases</em> the guilt and <em>pursuing</em> (and even receiving) the knowledge of God <em>reveals</em> the guilt. For Barth, the relationship between divine revelation and human plight is direct, not inverse.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>And yet, despite this direct correlation between revelation and plight, there is no escape from the judgment of God. There is no religiously privileged position from which the Church can judge Israel or the world. And there is no religion-<em>less</em> position from which the world can judge the Church. For Barth, as it is with Israel, so it is with the Church, and so it is with the entire world of ineluctably religious human beings.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Barth usually glosses “Israel” as the “Church” and “Gentiles” as the “world.” However, we should note that Barth is making an argument from the greater to the lesser when it comes to the relationship between Israel and the Church. He admits that the pinnacle of human religion, which is already the highest human possibility, is to be found in the history of Israel, asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can there be a ‘supreme’ religion, a highest pinnacle of all human work, in the relation between God and men? If such a religion were to be found anywhere, it would be in the ‘religion’ of the prophets and psalmists of Israel, which is nowhere excelled, certainly not in the history of Christianity, and not even in the so-called ‘Religion of Jesus’.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Barth is willing to mention Israel and Christianity in a differentiated manner. And yet Barth sees no religious evolutionary progress from Judaism to Christianity. The pinnacle of religion had already been reached in the history of Israel, before the history of the Church.</p>
<p>Now, of course, for Barth, to call something the “pinnacle of religion” is a particularly damning critique! And he immediate says that “a religion adequate to revelation and congruent to the righteousness of God, a law of righteousness, is unattainable,” except through the miracle of faith.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></sup> However, Barth is arguing that, if even Israel failed to attain the righteousness of God, then the Church will fare no better.</p>
<p>Although some might suggest that, given the direct correlation between revelation and plight, the best course of action would be to distance ourselves from the guilty Church, Barth maintains that there really is no escape from the solidarity of human beings under the judgment of God. He writes that “in the Church humanity becomes conscious of itself and is manifested as religious.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-8">[8]</a></sup></sup> Therefore, “in describing the Church we are describing ourselves.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-9">[9]</a></sup></sup> After all, Barth maintains that “in the affairs of God it is impossible for one individual to range itself against another, or one person against another. We cannot examine men, and then proceed to justify some and to condemn others.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-10">[10]</a></sup></sup> The knowledge of God, therefore, leads to a crisis, a judgment, a critique of ourselves and our best thoughts about God.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-11">[11]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3 id="and-yet-the-light-shines-in-the-darkness-romans-10421">And Yet, The Light Shines in the Darkness (Romans 10:4–21)</h3>
<p>Barth insists that, despite the Church’s tribulation and guilt, there is a way forward. But it is not pleasant. For Barth, “the hope of the Church” is manifest “precisely where its guilt is proven.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-12">[12]</a></sup></sup> The stone of stumbling, the rock of offense, is the only way forward. That is, in order to see the light of God that shines in the darkness, the Church must accept the judgment of God as her own, instead of trying to escape the judgment.</p>
<p>After all, on its own, the Church is desperately incapable. It is unable to have faith. It is unable to “do the law,” which, for Barth, means comprehending “that human righteousness comes into being only through the majesty of the nearness of God and of His election.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-13">[13]</a></sup></sup> The Church is unable to bring Christ near or to make Christ present. The Church can’t even negate its way to God!<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-14">[14]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Instead, the light shines in the darkness because God himself has already drawn near in Jesus Christ. Not, mind you, in a way that can be grasped and claimed by the Church as a possession. But, nevertheless, in an eschatological nearness that enables all human beings to call upon the Lord Jesus Christ and accept both the judgment and the salvation of God.</p>
<p>And yet, the light shines in “real darkness.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup></sup> Barth writes that “what is demanded of us here is that we should know that we are understood by God—in our lack of understanding.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-16">[16]</a></sup></sup> We best serve the Church by reminding it that even this demand exceeds its grasp. For Barth, we must not minimize but must instead emphasize “that the tribulation of the Church is its guilt, and that its guilt consists in a perpetual avoiding of the tribulation which it suffers from the secret of God.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-17">[17]</a></sup></sup> “The Church needs to be continually reminded of the most serious of all symptoms. It was the Church, not the world, which crucified Christ.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-18">[18]</a></sup></sup> Römerbrief chapter 10 was written as just such a reminder. With great revelation comes great culpability.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-what-should-we-make-of-barths-reading">ASSESSMENT: WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OF BARTH’S READING?</h2>
<p>So much for a summary sketch of chapter 10. Let’s now assess Barth’s argument.</p>
<h3 id="first-barth-was-right-to-critique-the-church">First, Barth Was Right to Critique the Church.</h3>
<p>Previously, in chapter 9, Barth wrote that “in contrast with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, there is thrust upon our attention—Israel, the Church, the world of religion as it appears in history, and, we hasten to add, Israel in its purest, truest, and most powerful aspect.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-19">[19]</a></sup></sup> The first time I read those words, I’m pretty sure my jaw hit the ground. And yet, I believe that Karl Barth was right to use Romans 9–11 to critique the Church instead of critiquing Israel. He was right, in other words, to interpret Paul’s words “to all God’s beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints” (Rom. 1:7) as an internal critique of the Church rather than an external critique of Israel.</p>
<p>And, as far as an internal critique of the Church goes, I believe that Barth gives some very good advice to the Church. Instead of grasping for a religiously privileged position that does not exist, Barth urges the Church to submit to the judgment of God. Like a good prophet, he calls the people of God to repent. Consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were the Church to appear before men as a Church under judgment; did it know of no other justification save that which is in judgment; did it believe in the stone of stumbling and rock of offence, instead of being offended and scandalized at it; then, with all its failings and offences—and certainly one day purified of some of them—it would be the Church of God.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-20">[20]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, this sounds like Paul, who, right after proclaiming that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes (Rom. 1:16–17), then proceeds to cut everyone down to size by reminding them that there’s no human path to the righteousness of God apart from submitting to the judgment of God (1:18–3:20). Humble repentance, not positivistic boasting, is the correct human response to God’s gracious salvation.</p>
<p>I largely agree with what Gaventa recently argued at the 2019 Karl Barth Conference.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-21">[21]</a></sup></sup> On the one hand, Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is dangerous, because it leaves the door open for supersessionism, and wrong, because it “violates the plain sense of the text.” Yet, on the other hand, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 flows naturally from his emphasis on human solidarity and the qualitative difference between God and humanity in his reading of Romans 1–8. Furthermore, Barth’s prophetic and pastoral indictment of Christian arrogance coheres with other aspects of Paul’s letter.<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-22">[22]</a></sup> As Gaventa pointed out, throughout the letter, Paul appears to draw lines between human groups, but he then proceeds to erase those lines.<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his critique of the guilty Church in Römerbrief 10, Barth is at least attempting to take the same posture as Paul. As a Jewish Christian writing to Christians in Rome, Paul took a posture of self-critique and solidarity with Israel. Barth therefore takes a posture of self-critique and solidarity with the Church.</p>
<h3 id="and-yet-barth-was-wrong-to-miss-the-jew-gentile-tensions-within-the-church">And Yet, Barth Was Wrong to Miss the Jew-Gentile Tensions WITHIN the Church.</h3>
<p>Exegetically speaking, using Romans 9:30–10:21 to critique the Church at least plausibly depends on Paul’s admission in the following chapter that he is speaking to “you Gentiles” as “an apostle to the Gentiles” (11:13). That is, the Gentiles among his predominantly Gentile Christian audience at Rome. At this point, we should recall that, in Romans 9:30–10:21, Paul is in the second stage of his argument that “It is not as though the word of God had failed” (9:6a). The first stage of his argument (9:6–29) was that “not all Israelites truly belong to Israel” (9:6b), “and not all of Abraham’s children are his true descendants” (9:7a). That is, membership in the people of God has always been determined by God’s gracious election—nothing else.</p>
<p>But what was the problem that necessitated this argument in the first place? Why, in other words, would anyone think that the word of God had failed? We get the answer in Romans 9:30–31: “Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith; but Israel, who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law, did not succeed in fulfilling that law.” I take Paul to be referring to the fact that, at that time, the Church was becoming more prominently Gentile, and that the message concerning Jesus as the Messiah was getting a better hearing, as it were, among Gentiles than among Jews.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-24">[24]</a></sup></sup> If the gospel were “the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek” (1:16), then why was it receiving such a relatively poor hearing among the Jews? Did this imply some kind of faithlessness on God’s part? Had his word to his chosen people failed (9:6)? Was God being unjust (9:14)? Had God rejected his people (11:1)?</p>
<p>Paul’s answer to these questions in Romans 9–11 is an emphatic “No!” He argues for continuity in the saving works of God, despite the apparent discontinuity in the response of Jews and Gentiles to Jesus the Messiah. This argument about God’s faithfulness, then, has implications for both Jewish and Gentile believers—a mixture reflected in the original audience of Paul’s letter.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Paul elegantly interweaves critiques of Jewish and Gentile Christians throughout his letter. Here, in Romans 9–11, after critiquing the majority of Israel for not pursuing the “law of righteousness. . . on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works” (9:31–32), Paul springs a rhetorical trap, as it were, and accuses Gentile Christians of being no better than Jews (11:11–32). These critiques play a role in laying the foundation for what Paul has to say in Romans 12–16, especially to the “strong” and the “weak” in chapters 14 and 15.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-25">[25]</a></sup></sup> The pastoral heart of the book of Romans is arguably Paul’s exhortation to Jewish and Gentile Christians to “welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God” (15:7).<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-26">[26]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>In Romans 9:30–10:21, then, Paul is critiquing Israel for failing to follow her Law to its <em>telos</em>, Jesus the Messiah. But he is doing so in order to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians within the Church. Barth therefore at least has room to consider what role Paul’s critique of Israel should play for a Christian audience. So, although he should have said more about Israel, perhaps focusing on the Church in Römerbrief 10 was justified.</p>
<p>However, when Barth equates “Gentiles” with “the world” in Romans 9–11, he is sawing-off the exegetical branch he is sitting on. Paul’s critique of Gentile Christians vis-a-vis Israel in chapter 11 is the most immediate exegetical justification for applying the critique of Israel in chapters 9 and 10 to the Church. But, according to Barth, the “Gentiles” are “those outside” the Church. Commenting on Romans 9:30 (“What then are we to say? Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith”), Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KRISIS appears here first. We have to recognize that, side by side with those who have knowledge and who are saints and children of God, there exist ignorant and unholy men of the world. However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness. . . . How can it be that the Gentiles, when confronted with the Church, are, and remain, Gentiles?<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-27">[27]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Barth’s theological conclusions about the relationship between the Church and the world might be legitimate. But the fact remains that this is almost completely the opposite of what was most likely in the background to Romans 9:30–10:21. It was the Church’s relative success among the Gentiles and relative failure among the Jews that Paul had in mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Barth might be correct in his refusal to identify and quantify who is “in” and who is “out” when it comes to God’s gracious election. But, for Paul and his audience, “Jews,” “Gentiles,” the “strong,” the “weak,” and “doing the law” at least had concrete, visible ramifications. These things were not merely eschatological.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-28">[28]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>In his comments upon Romans 10:12–13 (“For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved’”), Barth writes: “But are these men within the Church, or outside it, or are they members of some Church of their own founding? The question is trivial.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-29">[29]</a></sup></sup> Why trivial? Because Barth maintains that these “faithful heathen” are an “eschatological quantity.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-30">[30]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>I disagree. Although Barth is absolutely correct to interpret Paul as arguing for (1) unity between Jews and Gentiles on the basis of (2) the judgment and the salvation of God, he is guilty of overlooking the fact that, for Paul and the Roman Christians, differences between Jews and Gentiles were still significant, even if they were not meant to be ultimate/final.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-31">[31]</a></sup></sup> Although Barth was right to use Romans 9–11 as an internal critique of the Church, the main problem with Barth’s reading of Romans 10 and Romans 9–11 is that, while Paul is speaking about Israel in order to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians, Barth is speaking about the Church’s relationship to the world.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-32">[32]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Borrowing Barth’s words from his preface to the English translation of Römerbrief, we might ask, after reading chapter 10 of the Romans commentary, “Did Paul think and speak in general and in detail in the manner in which [Barth has] interpreted him as thinking and speaking?” My answer would have to be “yes and no.” Yes, in general, but no in detail. Yes, in form, but no in content.</p>
<p>Yes, the internal critique of the Church is Paul’s. But, no, Paul was not primarily talking about the relationship between the Church and the world. He was primarily talking about the Church. Yes, Paul brought Jew and Gentile alike together under the judgment and the salvation of God. But, for Paul, the guilt of the Church was not its ignorance of its dialectical relationship with the world. Instead, for Paul, the Church is guilty primarily because of its internal divisions.</p>
<p>Is there a way to bring Paul and Barth together in Romans 9:30–10:21? I think and hope so. We might arrive at the same destination, with regards to the relationship between the Church and the world, but I think that, when reading Romans, we need to start with the divisions that exist within the Church. With great revelation comes great culpability. The Church cannot comprehend the nature of her division and divisiveness apart from her knowledge of God. “There is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all” (10:12). And yet the Church cannot afford to erase or forget the distinction between Jew and Greek from her own internal history.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-33">[33]</a></sup></sup> Within the Church, the light of Christian unity shines, but it shines in divided and divisive darkness.</p>

<p>In what follows, I will focus upon the second edition of Barth’s commentary. However, it is helpful to note that Barth made some structural changes in chapter ten between the first and second editions. In Römerbrief 1919, chapter 10 is titled “A Guilt,” and the section headings are: Clarifications (10:1–3); The Message (10:4–15); The Deaf Ears (10:16–21). Barth addresses Romans 9:30–33 in the final subsection, “The Stone of Stumbling,” in chapter 9, titled “A Plight” (Eine Not). <em>Der Römerbrief, Erste Fassung (1919)</em>, ed. Hermann Schmidt, GA II 16 (Zurich: Theologischer Verlag Zürich, 1985), 388–93; 394–426.</p>
<p>In Römerbrief 1922, Barth famously adds “the Church” into his chapter titles in 9–11. Chapter 10, “A Guilt,” becomes “The Guilt of the Church” (492–526). Furthermore, Barth moves Romans 9:30-33 into the beginning of chapter 10, combining them with 10:1–3 and calling the subsection, not “The Stone of Stumbling” or “Clarifications,” but rather “The KRISIS of Knowledge” (492–507). He also combines Romans 10:4–15 and 16–21 into a subsection titled, not “The Message” or “The Deaf Ears,” but “The Light in the Darkness” (507–26).</p>
<p>So, between the first and second editions, it seems that Barth is doubling-down on his application of Romans 9–11 to the Church (as seen in the chapter titles), while also attempting the follow the contours of Paul’s letter a bit better (by seeing a break at 9:30 rather than 10:1). Among others, Cranfield, Jewett, Moo, Schreiner, NA28 and the NRSV all see a break at 9:30. See C. E. B. Cranfield, <em>A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans</em>, ICC (New York: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004), 2:503; Robert Jewett, <em>Romans</em>, Hermeneia (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2007), 606; Douglas J.

<p>You’re in much greater danger in the Holy of Holies than in the casino or anywhere else. Or, to borrow one of Barth’s images, when the revelatory shell explodes, those closest to it bear the brunt of the impact. Barth writes that “the real basis for this suffering coincides with the suffering’s basis of knowledge” (der Realgrund dieser Not zusammenfällt mit ihrem Erkenntnisgrund). Furthermore, “if human beings did not know/recognize God, they would not be in the position to recognize their suffering as such” (Würde er [der Mensch] Gott nicht erkennen, er wäre gar nicht in der Lage, seine Not als solche zu erkennen) Römer II, 493.

<p>The quote continues: “The Church, however, which sings its triumphs and trims and popularizes and modernizes itself, in order to minister to and satisfy every need except the one!; the Church which, in spite of many exposures, is still satisfied with itself, and, like quicksilver, still seeks and finds its own level; such a Church can never succeed, be it never so zealous, never so active in ridding itself of its failings and blemishes. With or without offences, it can never be the Church of God, because it is ignorant of the meaning of repentance.” Barth, Romans II, 370. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-20">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaventa, “The Finality of the Gospel.” <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-21">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, as Gaventa noted, Barth perhaps took his cue from some of Paul’s “unsettling exegetical moves” in Romans 9–11, like Paul’s use of Deuteronomy 30 to refer to “Jesus” and the “word of faith,” instead of to the “commandment.” Or Paul’s use of Hosea to refer to the Gentiles, instead of to Israel. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-22">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, Paul plays on Jewish stereotypes of Gentiles in the second half of chapter 1, before springing a rhetorical trap in chapter 2! In chapter 4, Paul brings up Abraham as the father of both the uncircumcised and the circumcised. And in chapter 5, Paul puts Jew and Gentile together in Adam and in Christ. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-23">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was a problem for Paul, given the Jewish provenance of the “the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh” (1:1–3). For more on the background and ethnic composition of Paul’s audience, see Jewett, Romans, 55–59, 70–72. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-24">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This point stands even though I admit that “strong” and “weak” probably do not exactly coincide with “Gentile” and “Jewish,” respectively. See Jewett, Romans, 70–72. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-25">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that it is legitimate to see Jew-Gentile tensions in the background here, because of what Paul then immediately says: “For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the <strong>circumcised</strong> on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the <strong>patriarchs</strong>, and in order that the <strong>Gentiles</strong> might glorify God for his mercy” (15:8–9, emphasis added). <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-26">↑</a></p>

<li>
<p>Barth, Romans II, 363. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-27">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his comments upon Romans 10:4–5, Barth argues that both “the righteousness which proceeds from the faithfulness of God” (his rendering of ἡ…ἐκ πίστεως δικαιοσύνη, 10:6) and “the righteousness which proceeds from the law” are but two ways in which we encounter the one righteousness of God. “In the first case the righteousness of God is invisible (unanschaulicherweise), in the second it is visible (anschaulicherweise)” Romans II, 375; Römer II, 508. Nevertheless, in describing Paul’s quotation of Leviticus 18:5 (“Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that ‘the person who does these things will live by them,’” Rom. 10:5), Barth writes: “This is what Moses means. By using the Futurum aeternum, he cannot fail to make us understand that neither the promise nor the condition which is linked to it is direct and observable. Both are used to denote the possibility which is messianic and eschatological” Romans II, 376–77. To say nothing of all of the many interpretive issues involved here, the fact remains that, for the “strong” and the “weak” in Romans 14–15, “doing the law” almost assuredly involved anschaulicherweise matters such as what was on the table when Christians dined together. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-28">↑</a></p>

<p>Barth, Romans II, 384. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-30">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This oversight, I believe, explains why Barth only devotes only 24 pages to his discussion of Romans 14:1–15:13 (Römer II, 671–700; Romans II, 502–26). He claims that “Truth and Mercy hold together Jew and Gentile, Church and World” (<em>Romans II</em>, 526), but he misses the fact that, in both Romans 9–11 and 14–15, Paul is focusing on holding together Jew and Gentile within the Church. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-31">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be clear, Barth’s equation of “Israel” with “the Church” is also problematic. He should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel than he did. And this appears to be an error that he recognized and attempted to address. In his Shorter Commentary, Barth says much more about Israel than he did in Römerbrief. See <em>A Shorter Commentary on Romans</em> (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2012), 110–47. Nevertheless, even there, Barth views chapters 9–11 and, indeed, 9–16 as someone of a digression from the main theme of Romans. Regarding chapters 9–11, he writes that “we are dealing with a second, comparatively independent part of the Epistle” (110). He applies the same judgment to chapters 12–16. Barth claims that “[a]ll that needs saying about that work of salvation, about the life that has been promised in the Gospel to the man who is righteous through his faith, has been said in what precedes” (110). I strongly disagree with this, and I think that Barth’s own hermeneutical principles should have prevented him from seeing the second half of the letter as only incidental to its main theme! What if, instead, Romans 9–16 were seen as the main point—at least pastorally—of the letter? <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-32">↑</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m scheduled to give a paper on Karl Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 in <em>Der Römerbrief</em> at the <a href="#">2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium</a> at Princeton in August.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it’s a pleasure and a privilege to give a paper at the colloquium. However, in hindsight, I don’t know why I thought giving a paper on chapter 10 of Barth’s Römerbrief was a good idea!</p>
<p>Granted, I don’t have to solve all of the exegetical issues (of which there are many) in Romans 9:30–10:21. I just have to make some sense of what <em>Barth</em> thought about the passage.</p>
<p>But, it turns out (surprise, surprise), it’s difficult to make sense of what Barth thought about Romans 9–11!</p>
<h2 id="barth-on-romans-911-in-der-römerbrief">Barth on Romans 9–11 in <em>Der Römerbrief</em></h2>
<p>If you haven’t read Barth’s <em>Epistle to the Romans</em>, here are his chapter headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Ninth Chapter: The Tribulation of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9:1–5. Solidarity</li>
<li>9:6–13. The God of Jacob</li>
<li>9:14–29. The God of Esau</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Tenth Chapter: The Guilt of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9:30–10:4. The <em>KRISIS</em> of Knowledge</li>
<li>10:4–21. The Light in the Darkness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Eleventh Chapter: The Hope of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>11:1–10. The Oneness of God</li>
<li>11:11–24. A Word to Those Without</li>
<li>11:25–36. The Goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Barth then proceeds to lump all of Romans 12–15 into one chapter, “The Great Disturbance.” And Romans 14:1–15:13 is relegated to a 25-page subsection entitled “The <em>KRISIS</em> of Human Freedom and Detachment.”</p>
<p>Now, if you’ve read chapters 9–11 of St. Paul’s letter to the Romans, you might be wondering: “Where did Israel go?” Great question!</p>
<p>Barth makes the move from Israel to Church without slowing down. Commenting on Romans 9:1–5, after giving a summary of what he’s said about the gospel of Jesus Christ in Romans 1–8, Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now, in contrast with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, there is thrust upon our attention—Israel, the Church, the world of religion as it appears in history, and, we hasten to add, Israel in its purest, truest, and most powerful aspect. We are not here concerned with some debased from of religion, but with the ideal and perfect Church. (<em>Romans</em>, 332).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as someone who cut his teeth on the book of Romans in the wake of N.T. Wright, I’m pretty sure that my jaw hit the ground the first time I read that.</p>
<p>But perhaps I should have seen it coming! After all, earlier, commenting on “to the Jew first, and also to the Greek” in Romans 1:16–17, Barth wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no man who ought not to believe or who cannot believe. Neither <strong>the Jew</strong> nor <strong>the Greek</strong> is disenfranchised from the Gospel. . . . The Jew, the religious and ecclesiastical man, is, it is true, FIRST summoned to make the choice; this is because he stands quite normally on the frontier of this world and at the point were the line of intersection by the new dimensional plane (1:4) must be veritably seen (2:17–20; 3:1, 2; 9:4, 5; 10:14, 15). But the advantage of the Jew provides him with no precedence. The problem ‘Religion or Irreligion’—not to speak of the problem ‘Church or World’—is no longer a fundamental problem. (<em>Romans</em>, 40).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. So “the Jew” and “Israel” are both ciphers for “the religious and ecclesiastical man,” “the world of religion as it appears in history.”</p>
<h2 id="isnt-that-supersessionism">Isn’t that supersessionism?</h2>
<p>Without fail, Barth’s equation of “Israel” with “the Church,” built upon his apparent evacuation of “Jew” and “Israel” of all <em>Jewish</em> and <em>Israelite</em> content, raises the specter of “supersessionism,” the view that the Church supersedes, replaces, or supplants Israel.</p>
<p>After all, in a straightforward sense, Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist, because he literally replaces “Israel” with “Church” in his exposition!</p>
<h2 id="despite-this-its-become-increasingly-common-to-at-least-mitigate-the-accusation-of-supersessionism-against-barths-reading-of-romans-911">Despite this, it’s become increasingly common to at least mitigate the accusation of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11.</h2>
<p>Let me highlight a few of these defenses of Barth.</p>
<h3 id="katherine-sonderegger-that-jesus-christ-was-born-a-jew-karl-barths-doctrine-of-israel-pennsylvania-state-university-press-1992">Katherine Sonderegger, <em>That Jesus Christ Was Born A Jew: Karl Barth’s “Doctrine of Israel”</em> (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1992).</h3>
<p>In the chapter on <em>Der Römerbrief</em> in her examination of Barth’s doctrine of Israel, Sonderegger argues that Barth had a robust notion of solidarity between Israel and the Church, and that, thanks to his use of the figures of Prophet and Pharisee at least, “Barth does not discard history, empty it, or make it of no use or value” (42).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Barth is perhaps guilty of at least a kind of supersessionism in his exposition of Romans 9:30–10:21 in Romans. Soulen has has provided a helpful diagnostic framework of three different kinds of supersessionism: economic, punitive, and structural.</p>
<p>In his own words,</p>
<ol>
<li>economic supersessionism “holds that from the beginning, God’s purpose for carnal Israel in the economy of salvation was destined to be fulfilled and completed by Christ’s coming, after which its place was to be taken by the church” (415).</li>
<li>Punitive supersessionism “holds that God has angrily abrogated the covenant with Israel because of Israel’s de facto rejection of the gospel” (416). And</li>
<li>structural supersessionism “refers to the fact that the classical model” (of the canon’s coherence, that is), “taken as a whole, tends to render the Hebrew Scriptures largely indecisive for shaping doctrinal conclusions about how God engages creation in universal and enduring ways” (417).</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Soulen interprets Barth as (1) repudiating punitive and structural supersessionism while (2) supporting and defending “economic supersessionism.”</p>

Harink, “Barth’s Apocalyptic Exegesis and the Question of Israel in Römerbrief, Chapters 9-11,” Toronto Journal of Theology 25, no. 1 (2009): 5–18.</h3>
<p>In his 2009 article, Douglas Harink argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 cannot be regarded as supersessionist, precisely because he rigorously subverts any historicist or heilsgeschichtlich readings of the relation between Israel and the Church. In this respect Barth’s dialectical reading follows Paul’s apocalyptic understanding of history, even though it must be corrected at points with a better reading of Paul” (5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Critiquing Barth, Harink writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In his “consistent eschatology” of the radical Aufhebung and Begründung of all things created, Barth yields to a temptation that always hovers on the edges of apocalyptic theology, perhaps even Paul’s apocalyptic theology: the temptation to see God’s apocalypse in Jesus Christ as dissolving all creaturely being in its delimited, differentiated character (including God’s creature-by-promise-and-election, Israel), rather than as destroying the powers that set creaturely beings at enmity with one another and in bondage to decay” (16).</p>

<p>Here is how Wesley Hill assessed Barth’s exegesis of Romans 9:1–5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is not to claim that Barth’s exegesis amounts to a repetition of Paul’s “original intention”; it is, rather, simply to suggest that Paul’s distinctions between Jew and Gentile, and unbelieving Israel and believers in Jesus, are destabilized and reconfigured in Rom 9-11 in such a way that Barth may be considered to be on Pauline ground when he presses and probes these various group descriptors—for example, “Jew,” “Israel,” “Gentile”— to see where and how they may expand to make room for fresh hermeneutical appropriation and application. A case may be made for seeing Barth’s exegesis, despite its weaknesses, as theologizing with, not against, Paul” (149).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this assessment, and also with Hill’s modification of Soulen’s charge of “economic supersessionism.” Barth is actually closer to <strong>structural</strong> supersessionism in the 1922 edition of his Romans commentary.</p>
<p>As Hill puts it, “Israel simply does not feature in any central way in Barth’s exposition of what by common consent is Paul’s most sustained, penetrating discussion of Israel’s role in God’s salvific purposes” (152n63). This sounds a lot like the “Israel-forgetfulness” that Soulen mentions in his description of structural supersessionism (“Karl Barth and Future of the God of Israel,” 417).</p>

<p>Susannah Ticciati suggests that Barth was right to put the Church in the place of “hardened Israel” in his <em>Römerbrief</em> reading of Romans 9–11. Yet, he was guilty of forgetting Israel, “eliding Jews and Judaism from discussion of the text.”</p>
<p>She writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“if the church today is going to understand itself as (part of) Israel, claiming the name Israel for itself (even if not exclusively), then it will not be long, or at least should not be long, before it recognises that it has itself become hardened Israel, no longer the marginal gathering around the apostles of Christ, but a well-established institution which cannot escape the kind of systemic corruption for which the prophets called Israel of old to account. This is one of the radical insights of Karl Barth’s Romans, in which Barth equates the Israel lamented by Paul in Romans 9 with ‘the Church’. I follow Barth in this insight here, but with the hindsight provided by the historical paradigm shifts summarised above, and therefore without eliding Jews and Judaism from discussion of the text, as Barth does in his commentary” (513).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her explanation (and justification) for Barth’s equation of the Church with unbelieving Israel, Ticciati writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Church is ranged with all other human possibilities (under the banner of ‘religion’) as that which God brings radically in question. To be sure, it is the canal where the living waters of revelation have previously flowed; but it is an empty canal which can neither compel nor constrain them. Thus ‘belief in Christ’, as a divine possibility, is not something the Church can lay claim to, either as such or by contrast with other human bodies. In Barth’s words (commenting on Rom 11.20): ‘But who is a believer? and who an unbeliever? Belief and unbelief are established only in God. For us they are unobservable, incomprehensible, and uncertain.’ ¶ It is only a small step to the recognition that the Church, as a mere human possibility – far from being the ‘us’ of Rom 9.24 – can only be hardened Israel” (515).</p>

<p>As it turns out, Beverly Gaventa just gave a talk on Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 at the 2019 Karl Barth Conference at Princeton.</p>
<p>Here’s her talk:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4-r_vUsvEc?start=65&feature=oembed" title="Beverly Gaventa | The 2019 Annual Karl Barth Conference - Lecture" width="750"></iframe>
<p>One of Gaventa’s central claims, then, is that “even with its serious flaws, Barth’s treatment of Romans 9-11 has a contribution to make to our understanding of Paul.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, then, Gaventa thinks that Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is <em>dangerous</em>, because it leaves the door open for supersessionism, and <em>wrong</em>, because it “violates the plain sense of the text.”</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Gaventa argues that Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flows naturally from his stance on human solidarity given the qualitative difference between God and humanity as explained in his reading of Romans 1–8.</li>
<li>Is a pastoral/prophetic indictment of Christian arrogance.</li>
<li>Coheres with other aspects of Paul’s letter.</li>
</ol>
<p>What “other aspects” does Barth’s reading cohere with? Gaventa highlights some of “Paul’s ‘unsettling’ exegetical moves” in Romans 9–11, such as his use of Deuteronomy 30 to speak, not of the “commandment,” but of “Jesus” and “the word of faith.” Or his use of Hosea to refer to the Gentiles, instead of Israel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she points out that, throughout the letter, Paul <em>appears</em> to draw lines between human groups, but he then proceeds to <em>erase</em> those lines.</p>
<p>For example, Paul plays on Jewish stereotypes of Gentiles in the second half of chapter 1, before springing a rhetorical trap in chapter 2! Gaventa also notes how Paul handles Abraham vis-a-vis the question of circumcision in chapter 4. Paul then puts everyone together in Adam and in Christ in chapter 5.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-the-biggest-problem-with-barths-reading-isnt-supersessionism">What if the biggest problem with Barth’s reading isn’t supersessionism?</h2>
<p>I think that Sonderegger, Soulen, Harink, Hill, Ticciati, and Gaventa are all on the right track. It’s too easy to accuse Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 in the <em>Romans</em> commentary of supersessionism <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a mistake for Barth not to consider the particularities of Israel. This was a mistake that he began to address in his readings of Romans 9–11 in his <em>Shorter Commentary</em> and in the <em>Church Dogmatics</em>. But, as Soulen points out (and as Ticciati also argues in her recent chapter on Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 in the <em>Dogmatics</em>), Barth never fully abandoned some form of supersessionism. For Barth, Israel and the Church always go together as two forms of the one people of God, but there’s an irreversible and, in some sense, asymmetric relationship between the two. The relationship between Israel and the Church moves from judgment to mercy, from hearing to believing, from passing to coming.</p>
<p>However (and here’s my contribution to this discussion), I don’t think that the (potential) supersessionism of reading “the Church” for “Israel” is the biggest problem with Barth’s <em>Römerbrief</em> reading of Romans 9–11.</p>
<h2 id="instead-i-think-the-biggest-problem-with-barths-reading-is-that-he-equated-the-gentiles-that-paul-mentions-in-romans-930-and-again-in-1111ff-with-the-world">Instead, I think the biggest problem with Barth’s reading is that he equated the “Gentiles” that Paul mentions in Romans 9:30 (and again in 11:11ff.) with the “world.”</h2>
<p>Barth thereby fails to recognize that Paul is speaking to/about Gentile <em>Christians</em>. He misses Paul’s pastoral focus on Jew-Gentile tensions <em>within</em> the Church, and instead focuses on the relationship between the Church and the world.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of the problematic equation of “Gentiles” in Romans 9–11 with the “world.” Commenting on Romans 9:30 (Τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν; ὅτι ἔθνη τὰ μὴ διώκοντα δικαιοσύνην κατέλαβεν δικαιοσύνην, δικαιοσύνην δὲ τὴν ἐκ πίστεως), Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KRISIS appears here first. We have to recognize that, side by side with those who have knowledge and who are saints and children of God, there exist ignorant and unholy men of the world. However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness” (363).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking this notion to its conclusion, Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet, suppose it be allowed and granted that there is also salus extra ecclesiam, that both Esau and Jacob can be elect, what becomes of the backbone of the Church, what confidence can it have in its own mission? Does the Roman Church, in advancing its own well – known claims, do more than protect the proper interests of every Church? What becomes of Israel’s following after righteousness, of its zeal for God, if it be granted that the goal has been reached by those ‘others’ who take no part in this zealous pursuit? Can the Church fail to recognize the reproach which is implicit in God’s undertaking to do, alongside of, and apart from, the Church, the work with which it has been entrusted, and which is the justification of its very existence? What attitude does the Church adopt to this reproach?” (365).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can leave the admittedly complicated question of <em>salus extra ecclesiam</em> aside for the moment. The main problem with Barth’s exegesis here is that this is precisely not what Paul is saying!</p>
<p>The “Gentiles” that have attained to the righteousness of faith are not some kind of “anonymous Christians” outside the Church. They are, instead, within the Church. When Paul writes in Romans 11:13 “Now I am speaking to you Gentiles,” he is not referring, as Barth claims, to the dialectical relationship between the Church and the world, but rather to the predominantly Gentile Christians in Rome!</p>
<p>In this respect, the main problem with Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 is that his use of these verses to critique the Church plausibly relies on Paul’s admission that he is speaking to “you Gentiles” in 11:13. That is, the Gentiles among his Christian audience at Rome. On this basis, Barth therefore at least has room to consider what role Paul’s critique of Israel in 9:30–10:21 should play for a Christian Gentile audience.</p>
<p>However, Barth’s equation of “Gentiles” with the “world” prevents me from being able to justify Barth’s exegesis in this way! He’s effectively sawing-off the exegetical branch on which he’s seated! The only way that his reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 as the guilt of the Church passes exegetical muster here is if he can appeal to Paul’s clarification to Gentile Christians in Romans 11 that they are no better than Israel.</p>
<p>Barth is focusing so much on the solidarity—the dialectical identity—of Israel and the Church that he is missing Paul’s focus on differentiation within the Church. While Paul’s argument in Romans 1:18–3:20 supports Barth’s insistence that no human group has soteriological superiority over any other, Paul is more nuanced in Romans 9–11. He is doing something different, not merely repeating what he said in 1:18–3:20.</p>
<p>Barth writes that “However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness” (363; German original reads: “Die Kirche, heiße sie wie sie wolle, hat neben sich die Heiden, die Fremden, die Nicht-Verstehenden, die Unbeteiligten, die der Gerechtigkeit nicht Nachjagenden”).</p>
<p>That might be true, but that’s not the Paul is referring to <em>ethne</em> in this passage. The Gentiles are Christians!</p>
<p>Now, Barth is absolutely correct to interpret Paul as arguing for (1) unity between Jews and Gentiles on the basis of (2) the judgment and the salvation of God. However, at least here in the <em>Romans</em> commentary, I believe that Barth is overlooking the fact that, for Paul and the Roman Christians, differences between Jews and Gentiles were still significant, even if they were not meant to be ultimate/final.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-miss-the-jew-gentile-tensions-within-the-church-you-miss-the-pastoral-point-of-romans">If you miss the Jew-Gentile tensions <em>within</em> the Church, you miss the (pastoral) point of Romans!</h2>
<p>I agree with the thrust of Scot McKnight’s argument, in his recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Romans-Backwards-Gospel-Empire/dp/1481308777"><em>Reading Romans Backward: A Gospel of Peace in the Midst of Empire</em></a>, that “Romans 12–16…reveals the pastoral context of Romans.”</p>
<p>(Here’s a webinar where Scot introduces his work.)</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/325227168?dnt=1&app_id=122963" title="Reading Romans Backwards Webinar Replay" width="750"></iframe>
<p>That’s why I think it’s so lamentable that Barth puts Romans 12:1–15:13 into a <em>single chapter</em> in the <em>Romans</em> commentary.</p>
<p>And the only thing that Barth can squeeze out of Romans 14–15 is self-critique—that we should read Romans against ourselves. That’s great, and it’s not foreign to Paul in Romans (as Gaventa points out), but it’s not exactly what Paul is up to in Romans 14–15!</p>
<p>Paul has very specific tensions in mind <em>within</em> the Christian community (communities) in Rome—tensions that had to do with Christians’ attitudes toward Jewish Law and traditions. And I think that McKnight is right to claim that Paul is speaking to the “strong” and the “weak” of Romans 14–15 throughout the entire letter!</p>
<p>Barth claims that “Truth and Mercy hold together Jew and Gentile, Church and World” (<em>Romans</em>, 526), but he misses the fact that, in both Romans 9–11 and 14–15, Paul is focusing on holding together Jew and Gentile <em>within</em> the Church!</p>
<p>The “strong” and the “weak” in Romans 14–15 were not necessarily “Gentiles” and “Jews” respectively. As Thielman notes, “the situation in mid first-century Rome was more complex than this simple division allows” (<em>Romans</em>, ZECNT, Zondervan, 2018, p. 629). Nevertheless, the identification of the “strong” and the “weak” almost undoubtedly had to do with Jewish customs, and not, as Barth seems to claim, merely with the extent to which one had grasped Pauline theology and the KRISIS of God.</p>
<h2 id="barth-seems-to-have-missed-the-pastoral-point-of-romans">Barth seems to have missed the pastoral point of Romans.</h2>
<p>Barth claimed, in the preface to Hoskyns’ English translation of Romans, that, “in writing this book, I set out neither to compose a free fantasia upon the theme of religion, nor to evolve a philosophy of it. My sole aim was to interpret Scripture” (ix).</p>
<p>It is unfair, therefore, to critique Barth’s exposition of Romans 9:30–10:21 in chapter ten of <em>Römerbrief</em> by simply claiming that Barth was intending to carry forward his theological critique of religion, and not interested in explaining what Paul had to say.</p>
<p>However, it is entirely fair to critique Barth’s work by holding him accountable to the text of Romans 9:30–10:21. He himself said so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proper criticism of my book can be concerned only with the interpretation of the text of the Epistle. . . . My book deals with one issue, and with one issue only. Did Paul think and speak in general and in detail in the manner in which I have interpreted him as thinking and speaking? Or did he think and speak altogether differently? The fourth and last request I have to make of my English speaking readers is therefore quite direct. Of my friendly readers I ask that they should take nothing and believe nothing from me which they are not of themselves persuaded stands within the meaning of what Paul wrote. Of my unfriendly readers I ask that they should not reject as an unreasonable opinion of my own what, in fact, Paul himself propounded. The purpose of this book neither was nor is to delight or to annoy its readers by setting out a New Theology. The purpose was and is to direct them to Holy Scripture, to the Epistle of Paul to the Romans, in order that, whether they be delighted or annoyed, whether they are ‘accepted’ or ‘rejected’, they may at least be brought face to face with the subject-matter of the Scriptures” (<em>Romans</em>, ix–x).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Especially when it comes to Barth’s equation of “Gentiles” in Romans 9–11 with the “world,” I do not think that Paul thought and spoke “in general and in detail” as Barth interpreted him.</p>
