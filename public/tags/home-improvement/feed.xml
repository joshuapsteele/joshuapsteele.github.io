      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bought our first house in late 2023 and, since moving-in in January 2024, I’ve been chipping away at home improvement projects. Since I’m a software engineer and spend my day in front of a screen, I enjoy working with tools as a change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some upcoming projects will clearly outstrip my capabilities and I plan to hire professionals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Replace roof and gutters&lt;br&gt;
– Replace furnace and central air conditioning&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We bought our first house in late 2023 and, since moving-in in January 2024, I’ve been chipping away at home improvement projects. Since I’m a software engineer and spend my day in front of a screen, I enjoy working with tools as a change of pace.</p>
<p>Now, some upcoming projects will clearly outstrip my capabilities and I plan to hire professionals:</p>
<p>– Replace roof and gutters<br>
– Replace furnace and central air conditioning</p>
<p>Other projects are probably beyond my capabilities, and I will most likely hire professionals. But, I still spend a fair bit of time thinking about doing them myself:</p>
<p>– Get/build a shed<br>
– Trim and/or take down tall oak trees (they’re quite tall and we’re in a residential neighborhood…if we lived out in the country, I’d totally try to do this myself!)<br>
– Install a handrail with columns on basement stairway (to prevent falling-off the stairs into the basement)</p>
<p>Other things I plan to do myself:</p>
<p>– Install water-powered backup sump pump (in progress!)<br>
– Clean gutters (which have really old and difficult-to-remove sheet metal “leaf guards” on them)<br>
– Fix oddly-wired light switches in bedrooms<br>
– Power-wash house, driveway, and sidewalk<br>
– Re-caulk exterior of house (ugh, really not looking forward to this…lots of scraping old caulk required!)<br>
– Install a new duct and register in main, finished basement room<br>
– Install new PVC drain pipes for kitchen sink and garbage disposal<br>
– Build my own garage workbench</p>
<p>I’ve got a bunch of hand and power tools already, but I’m running into a roadblock when it comes to obtaining and moving larger objects: I don’t have a truck!</p>
<p>This is currently preventing me from doing things like:</p>
<p>– Getting plywood and 2x4s for my workbench<br>
– Getting an extension ladder for cleaning out my gutters, trimming tree branches, etc.<br>
– Purchasing a used refrigerator for our garage<br>
– Purchasing a used table saw for our garage</p>
<p>Instead, we’ve got a 2007 Honda Civic sedan and a 2019 Kia Sedona minivan. Neither of which have roof bars or a towing hookup.</p>
<p>I’m debating installing a roof rack on one or both cars. I’m also considering purchasing a towing hookup for the minivan and getting a trailer from Harbor Freight.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’m on the lookout for a good deal on a used truck!</p>
<p>Given the truck roadblock, I’m also trying to figure out the best order to tackle these projects in.</p>
<p>I think it makes sense to start with getting a shed, since that would clear out more space in my garage for a work bench.</p>
<p>After that, though, I’m not sure. But “figure out a way to be able to transport large things” is definitely floating around at the top of the mental list.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how best to tackle some of these home improvement projects? Am I making too big of a deal about not having a truck, and should I just suck it up and either rent one or buy one? Let me know!</p>
