      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got my first table saw! A 1947 Craftsman 113.22400 8-inch table saw, for $40 on Facebook Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-do-list&#34;&gt;To Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to start using it, but first I want to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ Disassemble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean (in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove Rust (in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lubricate (in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace faulty power toggle switch (in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace blade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reassemble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;manuals&#34;&gt;Manuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the folks over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vintagemachinery.org/&#34;&gt;Vintage Machinery&lt;/a&gt;, it was easy enough to find the following manual PDFs for the saw and for the 1/2 HP motor:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="to-do-list">To Do List</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to start using it, but first I want to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Disassemble</li>
<li>Clean (in progress)</li>
<li>Remove Rust (in progress)</li>
<li>Lubricate (in progress)</li>
<li>Replace faulty power toggle switch (in progress)</li>
<li>Replace blade</li>
<li>Reassemble</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to the folks over at <a href="http://vintagemachinery.org/">Vintage Machinery</a>, it was easy enough to find the following manual PDFs for the saw and for the 1/2 HP motor:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/files/craftsman_table_saw_manual.pdf">Craftsman 113.1011 and 113.22400 Table Saw Manual</a></li>
<li><a href="/files/craftsman_table_saw_motor_manual.pdf">Craftsman 115.6962 Motor Manual</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are two diagrams from the manual, illustrating the various parts of the table saw.</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>And here is a diagram of the motor.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="questionsproblems-im-researching">Questions/Problems I&rsquo;m Researching</h2>
<h3 id="cleaning-the-rip-fence-thoroughly">Cleaning the rip fence thoroughly</h3>
<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, but I need to figure out how to disassemble the rip fence so that I can thoroughly clean the parts and remove rust. I just haven&rsquo;t been able to find a good YouTube video that covers this specifically, so I&rsquo;ll need to do a bit of manual-guided experimentation and then use an Evaporust soak and/or a Rustoleum gel spray.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-bigger-motor-pulley-for-the-1750-rpm-motor">Getting a bigger motor pulley for the 1750 RPM motor</h3>
<p>According to the table saw manual,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This saw is designed to be used with a 3450 rpm motor of the repulsion-induction or capacitor type; ½ hp for light duty, ¾ hp for heavy duty. &hellip; If a 1750 rpm motor is used it will be necessary to purchase a six-inch pulley and a longer belt.</p></blockquote>
<p>The motor I have, the Craftsman 115.6962, is a 1750 rpm motor. And its pulley is not a 6-inch pulley, but rather approximately a 3-inch pulley.</p>
<p>So, I need to figure out <strong>exactly which 6-inch pulley I need, and where to purchase one</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ll either update this blog post or add new posts as I get this saw back in tip-top shape!</p>

      <title>Home Improvement Roadmap and Roadblocks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bought our first house in late 2023 and, since moving-in in January 2024, I’ve been chipping away at home improvement projects. Since I’m a software engineer and spend my day in front of a screen, I enjoy working with tools as a change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some upcoming projects will clearly outstrip my capabilities and I plan to hire professionals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Replace roof and gutters&lt;br&gt;
– Replace furnace and central air conditioning&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We bought our first house in late 2023 and, since moving-in in January 2024, I’ve been chipping away at home improvement projects. Since I’m a software engineer and spend my day in front of a screen, I enjoy working with tools as a change of pace.</p>
<p>Now, some upcoming projects will clearly outstrip my capabilities and I plan to hire professionals:</p>
<p>– Replace roof and gutters<br>
– Replace furnace and central air conditioning</p>
<p>Other projects are probably beyond my capabilities, and I will most likely hire professionals. But, I still spend a fair bit of time thinking about doing them myself:</p>
<p>– Get/build a shed<br>
– Trim and/or take down tall oak trees (they’re quite tall and we’re in a residential neighborhood…if we lived out in the country, I’d totally try to do this myself!)<br>
– Install a handrail with columns on basement stairway (to prevent falling-off the stairs into the basement)</p>
<p>Other things I plan to do myself:</p>
<p>– Install water-powered backup sump pump (in progress!)<br>
– Clean gutters (which have really old and difficult-to-remove sheet metal “leaf guards” on them)<br>
– Fix oddly-wired light switches in bedrooms<br>
– Power-wash house, driveway, and sidewalk<br>
– Re-caulk exterior of house (ugh, really not looking forward to this…lots of scraping old caulk required!)<br>
– Install a new duct and register in main, finished basement room<br>
– Install new PVC drain pipes for kitchen sink and garbage disposal<br>
– Build my own garage workbench</p>
<p>I’ve got a bunch of hand and power tools already, but I’m running into a roadblock when it comes to obtaining and moving larger objects: I don’t have a truck!</p>
<p>This is currently preventing me from doing things like:</p>
<p>– Getting plywood and 2x4s for my workbench<br>
– Getting an extension ladder for cleaning out my gutters, trimming tree branches, etc.<br>
– Purchasing a used refrigerator for our garage<br>
– Purchasing a used table saw for our garage</p>
<p>Instead, we’ve got a 2007 Honda Civic sedan and a 2019 Kia Sedona minivan. Neither of which have roof bars or a towing hookup.</p>
<p>I’m debating installing a roof rack on one or both cars. I’m also considering purchasing a towing hookup for the minivan and getting a trailer from Harbor Freight.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’m on the lookout for a good deal on a used truck!</p>
<p>Given the truck roadblock, I’m also trying to figure out the best order to tackle these projects in.</p>
<p>I think it makes sense to start with getting a shed, since that would clear out more space in my garage for a work bench.</p>
<p>After that, though, I’m not sure. But “figure out a way to be able to transport large things” is definitely floating around at the top of the mental list.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how best to tackle some of these home improvement projects? Am I making too big of a deal about not having a truck, and should I just suck it up and either rent one or buy one? Let me know!</p>
