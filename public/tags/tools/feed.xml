      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got my first table saw! A 1947 Craftsman 113.22400 8-inch table saw, for $40 on Facebook Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-do-list&#34;&gt;To Do List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to start using it, but first I want to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ Disassemble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean (in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove Rust (in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lubricate (in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace faulty power toggle switch (in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace blade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reassemble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;manuals&#34;&gt;Manuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the folks over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vintagemachinery.org/&#34;&gt;Vintage Machinery&lt;/a&gt;, it was easy enough to find the following manual PDFs for the saw and for the 1/2 HP motor:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="to-do-list">To Do List</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to start using it, but first I want to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Disassemble</li>
<li>Clean (in progress)</li>
<li>Remove Rust (in progress)</li>
<li>Lubricate (in progress)</li>
<li>Replace faulty power toggle switch (in progress)</li>

<li>Reassemble</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="manuals">Manuals</h2>
<p>Thanks to the folks over at <a href="http://vintagemachinery.org/">Vintage Machinery</a>, it was easy enough to find the following manual PDFs for the saw and for the 1/2 HP motor:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/files/craftsman_table_saw_manual.pdf">Craftsman 113.1011 and 113.22400 Table Saw Manual</a></li>
<li><a href="/files/craftsman_table_saw_motor_manual.pdf">Craftsman 115.6962 Motor Manual</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are two diagrams from the manual, illustrating the various parts of the table saw.</p>

</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/craftsman_table_saw_manual_2.jpg" alt="Craftsman Table Saw Diagram, pt. 2"  />
</p>
<p>And here is a diagram of the motor.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="questionsproblems-im-researching">Questions/Problems I&rsquo;m Researching</h2>
<h3 id="cleaning-the-rip-fence-thoroughly">Cleaning the rip fence thoroughly</h3>
<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, but I need to figure out how to disassemble the rip fence so that I can thoroughly clean the parts and remove rust. I just haven&rsquo;t been able to find a good YouTube video that covers this specifically, so I&rsquo;ll need to do a bit of manual-guided experimentation and then use an Evaporust soak and/or a Rustoleum gel spray.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-bigger-motor-pulley-for-the-1750-rpm-motor">Getting a bigger motor pulley for the 1750 RPM motor</h3>
<p>According to the table saw manual,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This saw is designed to be used with a 3450 rpm motor of the repulsion-induction or capacitor type; ½ hp for light duty, ¾ hp for heavy duty. &hellip; If a 1750 rpm motor is used it will be necessary to purchase a six-inch pulley and a longer belt.</p></blockquote>
<p>The motor I have, the Craftsman 115.6962, is a 1750 rpm motor. And its pulley is not a 6-inch pulley, but rather approximately a 3-inch pulley.</p>
<p>So, I need to figure out <strong>exactly which 6-inch pulley I need, and where to purchase one</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ll either update this blog post or add new posts as I get this saw back in tip-top shape!</p>

      <title>Diagnostic Toos for Homeowners</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since buying our first house about a year ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten really into DIY home repair, home improvement, etc. As a software engineer, I find that working with physical tools on physical problems is a refreshing change of pace after staring at a screen all day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s an excuse to buy a bunch of tools!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of tools, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about diagnostic tools that would be helpful for a homeowner to own. Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the ones I own, organized roughly in order of importance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Help, I&#39;m Addicted to Mini Toolkits: The EDC Tool Struggle Is Real</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/help-im-addicted-to-mini-toolkits-the-edc-tool-struggle-is-real/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 16:09:39 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.</p>
<p>Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).</p>
<p>It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.</p>
<p>OK, but what about these “mini toolkits”?</p>
<p>It all started when I got the <a href="https://amzn.to/3XVS6fv">Sunex Tools 44-Piece 1/4″ Drive Mini Dual Flex Head Ratchet with Socket &amp; Bit Set (9732)</a>. I love the extra SAE/Metric flexibility from the spline sockets. And it’s got basically every bit I’ve needed.</p>
<p>Those spline sockets in the Sunex are actually why I ended up returning <a href="https://amzn.to/3XM6KG2">the extremely popular Wera Tool-Check Plus kit</a> after giving it a try. Sure, it’s definitely sexier and machined a bit better than the Sunex, but the Sunex sockets saved me at least once when the Wera failed me, so I really couldn’t justify keeping the (fairly expensive) Wera kit around.</p>
<p>Sure, I wish the Sunex kit had a better case, and could fit in my pocket, if needed…</p>
<p>So, enter what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/">the r/HarborFreight subreddit</a> calls the “Meme Tool”: the <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/locking-flex-head-ratchet-and-bit-set-35-piece-58074.html">ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet and Bit Set, 35-Piece</a>. She’s a beauty. I love that the ratchet is a *locking* flex head. The extension can be used in multiple configurations to get at just about any fastener. And, again, basically every bit I’ve ever needed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyvhq65iJ8s?feature=oembed" title="ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet And Bit Set, 35 Pc by Harbor Freight tools! NTDT!" width="750"></iframe></div></figure>What’s more, it’s got a no-hassle lifetime warranty, so if I happen to break something, I can go to the nearest Harbor Freight and get a new kit!
<p>I carry the Harbor Freight “Meme Tool” kit around with me most places, in addition to the Harbor Freight Leatherman Wave knockoff, the <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/20-in-1-multi-tool-59617.html">GORDON 20-in-1 Multi-Tool</a>.</p>
<p>The only thing the Harbor Freight meme tool is missing is *sockets*! This is the one thing the Sunex kit wins-out on. I wish there were a way to combine the nice case, better ratchet, and useful extension from the HF Icon kit with he sockets of the Sunex kit.</p>
<p>Turns out, I’m not the only one who feels this way! Someone over at r/HarborFreight has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/comments/1dhj1o8/i_present_to_you_hooligans_v2_the_icant/">designed a print-it-yourself case that can hold the original items from the Icon set plus sockets (they call it the ICAN’T, lol).</a></p>
<p>The only reason I haven’t bought <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/jaahwnsstuff/?etsrc=sdt">one of those modified ICAN’T cases from the absolute genius on Etsy</a> is that, last year at the SEMA 2023 conference, Harbor Freight unveiled a new “Meme Tool + Sockets” and said that it would come out sometime in 2024!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pr4fG5NzCo?start=585&feature=oembed" title="Unveiling all the NEW Harbor Freight Tools At SEMA 2023!" width="750"></iframe></div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Start at 9:45 to see the Meme Tool w/Sockets</figcaption></figure>So, here we are. It’s mid-September and I’m checking r/HarborFreight and the Harbor Freight website daily to see if the new Meme Tool w/Sockets is out yet.
<p>And, while I wait for Harbor Freight to come through, I can’t help but notice other ratchet, bit, and socket combinations out there (like <a href="https://amzn.to/4d8MDWV">this one from P.I.T.</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/4epaaUC">this one from Bosch</a>)!</p>
<p>Yes, I probably have a problem. But does anyone else out there have the same problem? Have you found a mini toolkit that you absolutely love? What about other EDC tools? Please let me know in the comments below!</p>
