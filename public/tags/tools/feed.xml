&lt;p>I know you&amp;rsquo;ve all been waiting for (lol) updates on my &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/vintage-craftsman-table-saw/">vintage 1947 Craftsman 113 table saw&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that, after disassembling and cleaning the saw, I was able to put it back together and get it running again!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img alt="Refurbished Craftsman Table Saw" loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/refurbished-table-saw.jpeg">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the process, I installed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A new &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3QVf5mv">power toggle switch&lt;/a> on the motor housing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4hXfz6C">safety ON/OFF switch for the front of the saw&lt;/a> (where you stand)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4iNvCF7">8-inch thin-kerf combination blade&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4cxyiEV">6-inch motor pulley&lt;/a> to replace the original 3-inch pulley (this was recommended in the manual since the motor is a 1750 RPM motor, not a 3450 RPM motor)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/41UHzmI">adjustable linked v-belt&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/43upo8x">larger caster wheels&lt;/a> for the base of the saw&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The rip fence provided some extra challenges, mainly because I accidentally broke the cam/clamp handle that holds the fence in place. I originally repaired the handle with some &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/42AkfKb">J-B Weld &amp;ldquo;SteelStik&amp;rdquo; epoxy putty&lt;/a>, which seemed strong and promising at first.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-table-saw">The Table Saw</h2>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve all been waiting for (lol) updates on my <a href="/vintage-craftsman-table-saw/">vintage 1947 Craftsman 113 table saw</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that, after disassembling and cleaning the saw, I was able to put it back together and get it running again!</p>
<p><img alt="Refurbished Craftsman Table Saw" loading="lazy" src="/refurbished-table-saw.jpeg"></p>
<p>In the process, I installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <a href="https://amzn.to/3QVf5mv">power toggle switch</a> on the motor housing</li>

<li>Some <a href="https://amzn.to/43upo8x">larger caster wheels</a> for the base of the saw</li>
</ul>
<p>The rip fence provided some extra challenges, mainly because I accidentally broke the cam/clamp handle that holds the fence in place. I originally repaired the handle with some <a href="https://amzn.to/42AkfKb">J-B Weld &ldquo;SteelStik&rdquo; epoxy putty</a>, which seemed strong and promising at first.</p>
<p><img alt="Attempted cam handle repair" loading="lazy" src="/rip-fence-handle-epoxy.jpeg"></p>
<p>However, when screwing the rip fence components back into place, which took some force due to rusted threads, the cam handle fell apart again.</p>
<p>Shout-out to my friend Doug, who suggested cleaning-up the threads with a tap and die kit. I&rsquo;ve never used one of these before, but I ordered an <a href="https://amzn.to/3XF18wG">SAE/Metric tap and die kit from Amazon</a>. With some 3-in-1 oil and some patience, it worked great for cleaning up the threads on the rod that runs along the inside of the rip fence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wasn&rsquo;t able to put the original handle back together. But after measuring the threads on the rip fence rod, I went out on a limb and tried <a href="https://amzn.to/4lcbSgf">this 10-32 interior thread cam lever handle from Amazon</a>. It didn&rsquo;t quite fit into the handle&rsquo;s original slot, but I was able to extend the rod a bit and it worked great to hold things together!</p>

<p>So, the saw is running pretty well now. I just need to get used to using a table saw (I have a pretty healthy fear of kickback), and figure out what I&rsquo;m going to make!</p>
<h2 id="other-saw-news">Other Saw News</h2>
<p>I bought this <a href="https://amzn.to/3DZtFqe">Milescraft saw safety bundle</a>, which includes a feather board and two different pushers.</p>
<p>Last year, I bought a <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/power-tools/power-saws/miter/12-in-dual-bevel-sliding-compound-miter-saw-with-precision-led-shadow-guide-56682.html">Hercules Miter Saw from Harbor Freight Tools</a> in order to install some baseboard trim throughout my house. I haven&rsquo;t used it much since, but it&rsquo;s still going strong and it&rsquo;s nice to have a chop saw ready to go for cross cuts.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m already invested in the Bauer cordless power tool line from Harbor Freight, and they had a &ldquo;buy a batter and charger and get a tool for free&rdquo; deal going, I bought a <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/20v-brushless-cordless-7-14-in-circular-saw-tool-only-59281.html">Bauer brushless cordless circular saw</a>. So far, I love it. Way nicer than the $20 Chicago Electric corded circular saw (also from HF!) that I&rsquo;ve had for years.</p>
<h2 id="upcoming-diy-projects">Upcoming DIY Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cutting down the leaning dead oak tree in my backyard</li>
<li>Repairing or replacing a cracked rectangular gable vent on the side of my house</li>
<li>Removing old, nasty insulation from my attic space and installing new insulation (fiberglass batts)</li>
<li>Cleaning the gutters</li>
<li>Inspecting and, if needed, repairing the roof</li>
</ul>
<p>What projects are you working on?</p>

<h2 id="questionsproblems-im-researching">Questions/Problems I&rsquo;m Researching</h2>
<h3 id="cleaning-the-rip-fence-thoroughly">Cleaning the rip fence thoroughly</h3>
<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, but I need to figure out how to disassemble the rip fence so that I can thoroughly clean the parts and remove rust. I just haven&rsquo;t been able to find a good YouTube video that covers this specifically, so I&rsquo;ll need to do a bit of manual-guided experimentation and then use an Evaporust soak and/or a Rustoleum gel spray.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-bigger-motor-pulley-for-the-1750-rpm-motor">Getting a bigger motor pulley for the 1750 RPM motor</h3>
<p>According to the table saw manual,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This saw is designed to be used with a 3450 rpm motor of the repulsion-induction or capacitor type; ½ hp for light duty, ¾ hp for heavy duty. &hellip; If a 1750 rpm motor is used it will be necessary to purchase a six-inch pulley and a longer belt.</p></blockquote>
<p>The motor I have, the Craftsman 115.6962, is a 1750 rpm motor. And its pulley is not a 6-inch pulley, but rather approximately a 3-inch pulley.</p>
<p>So, I need to figure out <strong>exactly which 6-inch pulley I need, and where to purchase one</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ll either update this blog post or add new posts as I get this saw back in tip-top shape!</p>

&lt;p>Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.</p>
<p>Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).</p>
<p>It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.</p>
<p>OK, but what about these “mini toolkits”?</p>
<p>It all started when I got the <a href="https://amzn.to/3XVS6fv">Sunex Tools 44-Piece 1/4″ Drive Mini Dual Flex Head Ratchet with Socket &amp; Bit Set (9732)</a>. I love the extra SAE/Metric flexibility from the spline sockets. And it’s got basically every bit I’ve needed.</p>
<p>Those spline sockets in the Sunex are actually why I ended up returning <a href="https://amzn.to/3XM6KG2">the extremely popular Wera Tool-Check Plus kit</a> after giving it a try. Sure, it’s definitely sexier and machined a bit better than the Sunex, but the Sunex sockets saved me at least once when the Wera failed me, so I really couldn’t justify keeping the (fairly expensive) Wera kit around.</p>
<p>Sure, I wish the Sunex kit had a better case, and could fit in my pocket, if needed…</p>
<p>So, enter what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/">the r/HarborFreight subreddit</a> calls the “Meme Tool”: the <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/locking-flex-head-ratchet-and-bit-set-35-piece-58074.html">ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet and Bit Set, 35-Piece</a>. She’s a beauty. I love that the ratchet is a *locking* flex head. The extension can be used in multiple configurations to get at just about any fastener. And, again, basically every bit I’ve ever needed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyvhq65iJ8s?feature=oembed" title="ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet And Bit Set, 35 Pc by Harbor Freight tools! NTDT!" width="750"></iframe></div></figure>What’s more, it’s got a no-hassle lifetime warranty, so if I happen to break something, I can go to the nearest Harbor Freight and get a new kit!
<p>I carry the Harbor Freight “Meme Tool” kit around with me most places, in addition to the Harbor Freight Leatherman Wave knockoff, the <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/20-in-1-multi-tool-59617.html">GORDON 20-in-1 Multi-Tool</a>.</p>
<p>The only thing the Harbor Freight meme tool is missing is *sockets*! This is the one thing the Sunex kit wins-out on. I wish there were a way to combine the nice case, better ratchet, and useful extension from the HF Icon kit with he sockets of the Sunex kit.</p>
<p>Turns out, I’m not the only one who feels this way! Someone over at r/HarborFreight has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/comments/1dhj1o8/i_present_to_you_hooligans_v2_the_icant/">designed a print-it-yourself case that can hold the original items from the Icon set plus sockets (they call it the ICAN’T, lol).</a></p>
<p>The only reason I haven’t bought <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/jaahwnsstuff/?etsrc=sdt">one of those modified ICAN’T cases from the absolute genius on Etsy</a> is that, last year at the SEMA 2023 conference, Harbor Freight unveiled a new “Meme Tool + Sockets” and said that it would come out sometime in 2024!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pr4fG5NzCo?start=585&feature=oembed" title="Unveiling all the NEW Harbor Freight Tools At SEMA 2023!" width="750"></iframe></div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Start at 9:45 to see the Meme Tool w/Sockets</figcaption></figure>So, here we are. It’s mid-September and I’m checking r/HarborFreight and the Harbor Freight website daily to see if the new Meme Tool w/Sockets is out yet.
<p>And, while I wait for Harbor Freight to come through, I can’t help but notice other ratchet, bit, and socket combinations out there (like <a href="https://amzn.to/4d8MDWV">this one from P.I.T.</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/4epaaUC">this one from Bosch</a>)!</p>
<p>Yes, I probably have a problem. But does anyone else out there have the same problem? Have you found a mini toolkit that you absolutely love? What about other EDC tools? Please let me know in the comments below!</p>
