      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.</p>
<p>Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).</p>
<p>It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.</p>
<p>OK, but what about these “mini toolkits”?</p>
<p>It all started when I got the <a href="https://amzn.to/3XVS6fv">Sunex Tools 44-Piece 1/4″ Drive Mini Dual Flex Head Ratchet with Socket &amp; Bit Set (9732)</a>. I love the extra SAE/Metric flexibility from the spline sockets. And it’s got basically every bit I’ve needed.</p>
<p>Those spline sockets in the Sunex are actually why I ended up returning <a href="https://amzn.to/3XM6KG2">the extremely popular Wera Tool-Check Plus kit</a> after giving it a try. Sure, it’s definitely sexier and machined a bit better than the Sunex, but the Sunex sockets saved me at least once when the Wera failed me, so I really couldn’t justify keeping the (fairly expensive) Wera kit around.</p>
<p>Sure, I wish the Sunex kit had a better case, and could fit in my pocket, if needed…</p>
<p>So, enter what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/">the r/HarborFreight subreddit</a> calls the “Meme Tool”: the <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/locking-flex-head-ratchet-and-bit-set-35-piece-58074.html">ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet and Bit Set, 35-Piece</a>. She’s a beauty. I love that the ratchet is a *locking* flex head. The extension can be used in multiple configurations to get at just about any fastener. And, again, basically every bit I’ve ever needed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyvhq65iJ8s?feature=oembed" title="ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet And Bit Set, 35 Pc by Harbor Freight tools! NTDT!" width="750"></iframe></div></figure>What’s more, it’s got a no-hassle lifetime warranty, so if I happen to break something, I can go to the nearest Harbor Freight and get a new kit!
<p>I carry the Harbor Freight “Meme Tool” kit around with me most places, in addition to the Harbor Freight Leatherman Wave knockoff, the <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/20-in-1-multi-tool-59617.html">GORDON 20-in-1 Multi-Tool</a>.</p>
<p>The only thing the Harbor Freight meme tool is missing is *sockets*! This is the one thing the Sunex kit wins-out on. I wish there were a way to combine the nice case, better ratchet, and useful extension from the HF Icon kit with he sockets of the Sunex kit.</p>
<p>Turns out, I’m not the only one who feels this way! Someone over at r/HarborFreight has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/comments/1dhj1o8/i_present_to_you_hooligans_v2_the_icant/">designed a print-it-yourself case that can hold the original items from the Icon set plus sockets (they call it the ICAN’T, lol).</a></p>
<p>The only reason I haven’t bought <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/jaahwnsstuff/?etsrc=sdt">one of those modified ICAN’T cases from the absolute genius on Etsy</a> is that, last year at the SEMA 2023 conference, Harbor Freight unveiled a new “Meme Tool + Sockets” and said that it would come out sometime in 2024!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pr4fG5NzCo?start=585&feature=oembed" title="Unveiling all the NEW Harbor Freight Tools At SEMA 2023!" width="750"></iframe></div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Start at 9:45 to see the Meme Tool w/Sockets</figcaption></figure>So, here we are. It’s mid-September and I’m checking r/HarborFreight and the Harbor Freight website daily to see if the new Meme Tool w/Sockets is out yet.
<p>And, while I wait for Harbor Freight to come through, I can’t help but notice other ratchet, bit, and socket combinations out there (like <a href="https://amzn.to/4d8MDWV">this one from P.I.T.</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/4epaaUC">this one from Bosch</a>)!</p>
<p>Yes, I probably have a problem. But does anyone else out there have the same problem? Have you found a mini toolkit that you absolutely love? What about other EDC tools? Please let me know in the comments below!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you stepping into the exciting world of software engineering, or considering whether to take that leap? You’re not alone. This field attracts countless individuals worldwide, fueled by an ever-increasing demand for technological solutions, the promise of high salaries, and a keen interest in problem-solving.</p>
<p>However, it’s essential to understand that coding and programming skills, while crucial, are just one part of a broader equation. Equally important is the bigger picture of how software development fits into the wider professional and business environment.</p>
<p>This is where two vital reads, Edmond Lau’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3JK2gbg"><em>The Effective Engineer: How to Leverage Your Efforts In Software Engineering to Make a Disproportionate and Meaningful Impact</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/44qx0pO"><em>The Missing README: A Guide for the New Software Engineer</em></a> by Chris Riccomini and Dmitriy Ryaboy, become indispensable.</p>
<h2 id="the-effective-engineer-more-than-coding-leverage">The Effective Engineer: More than Coding, LEVERAGE!</h2>
<p>Edmond Lau’s book is an influential text in the realm of software engineering literature. Rather than merely focusing on technical skills, <a href="https://amzn.to/3JK2gbg"><em>The Effective Engineer</em></a> broadens the horizon to include crucial soft skills and professional strategies. It is these ‘big-picture’ elements that often determine the disproportionate impact that a software engineer can make in their role.</p>
<p>Lau emphasizes the concept of ‘leverage’ – the ability to do more with less. He illustrates this with real-life examples from successful software companies, demonstrating how strategic thinking, effective communication, and a results-oriented mindset can create massive positive outcomes.</p>
<p>In the tech industry, where things move rapidly, and you’re always juggling multiple tasks, this book will help you maximize your productivity and make meaningful contributions, even as a newcomer. This isn’t a mere coding manual; it’s a comprehensive guide on how to be an influential software engineer.</p>
<h2 id="the-missing-readme-a-survival-guide-for-new-engineers">The Missing README: A Survival Guide for New Engineers</h2>
<p>Equally impactful is <a href="https://amzn.to/44qx0pO"><em>The Missing README: A Guide for the New Software Engineer</em></a> by Chris Riccomini and Dmitriy Ryaboy. This book is designed as the ‘missing manual’ for software engineers who are just starting their journey. It provides the career guidance often overlooked in formal education or bootcamp curriculums.</p>
<p>The authors skillfully guide the reader through the various non-technical aspects of a software engineer’s life. They cover everything from understanding codebase and working with a team, to dealing with managers, navigating office politics, and even planning a long-term career. This book presents a holistic overview of the field, giving newbies a clear roadmap to succeed in their software engineering career.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up-a-comprehensive-view-of-software-engineering">Wrap Up: A Comprehensive View of Software Engineering</h2>
<p>These two books, <a href="https://amzn.to/3JK2gbg"><em>The Effective Engineer</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/44qx0pO"><em>The Missing README</em></a>, offer big-picture career guidance that is essential for anyone stepping into the realm of software engineering. Whether you’re a budding developer just starting your journey or a career changer considering the leap, understanding the larger landscape is just as crucial as mastering coding.</p>
<p>As these books illustrate, the field of software engineering is not limited to writing flawless code. It’s also about understanding your role within a team, a company, and the wider tech industry. With these two resources in your arsenal, you’ll be well-equipped to make a meaningful and lasting impact in your software engineering career.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-follow-up-reading">Recommended Follow-Up Reading</h2>
<p>Enjoyed the insights and professional strategies in <a href="https://amzn.to/3JK2gbg"><em>The Effective Engineer</em></a> and <em><a href="https://amzn.to/44qx0pO">The Missing README</a></em>? Then you’ll appreciate these two additional resources. Considered foundational texts within the software development community, they will further your understanding of software engineering, bridging the gap between technical skills and the mindset required for mastery.</p>
<h3 id="the-pragmatic-programmer-your-journey-to-mastery-by-david-thomas-and-andrew-hunt"><a href="https://amzn.to/3PP1UUy"><em>The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery</em></a> by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt</h3>
<p>This classic text is often touted as a must-read for software developers. And for good reason! David Thomas and Andrew Hunt weave their decades of programming and consulting experience into a guide that is both practical and philosophical.</p>
<p>The book is designed to instill the mindset of a ‘pragmatic’ programmer, one who combines technical skills with a problem-solving approach that’s adaptable, critical, and creative. Through its exploration of coding principles, software design strategies, and real-world examples, it teaches how to develop robust, high-quality software that is maintainable over the long term.</p>
<h3 id="the-clean-coder-a-code-of-conduct-for-professional-programmers-by-robert-c-martin"><a href="https://amzn.to/43eTl8G"><em>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</em></a> by Robert C. Martin</h3>
<p>Authored by the renowned Robert C. Martin, often known as “Uncle Bob,” this book is less about the code and more about the coder. Martin presents a professional code of conduct for programmers, covering topics from work ethic and time management to collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>“The Clean Coder” delivers an in-depth analysis of the various challenges programmers face daily, beyond writing code. It’s a guide to becoming a professional who’s not only technically proficient but also responsible, collaborative, and effective in their broader role.</p>
<p>To summarise, both <a href="https://amzn.to/3PP1UUy"><em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/43eTl8G"><em>The Clean Coder</em></a> are excellent companions to <a href="https://amzn.to/3JK2gbg"><em>The Effective Engineer</em></a> and <em><a href="https://amzn.to/44qx0pO">The Missing README</a></em>. They’ll help you build on the foundational knowledge and strategies you’ve learned, transforming you from a proficient coder into a truly impactful and professional software engineer.</p>
