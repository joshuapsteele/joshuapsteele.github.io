      <description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election. Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)</p>
<p>As I’ve thought more about these topics, my reading list has grown, and I wanted to share it with you. It’s a mix of books I’ve read and some that are still on my to-read list. The first book that really shaped my thinking is <em><a href="https://amzn.to/43msglF">Resident Aliens</a></em>—a must-read if you’re interested in Christian political theology.</p>

<h3 id="abortion-specific-reads">Abortion-Specific Reads</h3>
<p>When it comes to abortion, I think it’s a tragedy that needs to be reduced, ideally through a consistent pro-life ethic. However, I’m also curious about progressive theological arguments for a pro-choice stance. Here are a few books I’m reading to explore those ideas:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="history-reading-list">History Reading List</h3>
<p>In addition to Christian political theology, I’ve also been diving into U.S. and world history, trying to get a better sense of where we’ve been and how it informs the present.</p>
