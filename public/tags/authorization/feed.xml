      <description>&lt;p&gt;Calling all software developers! As I embark on a new, exploratory work project, I&amp;rsquo;d like to hear your thoughts on authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How have you designed and implemented authorization in your applications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get into the weeds a bit, have you opted for RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control), ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control), or something else entirely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What tools or libraries have you found most useful in your work? Have you built everything from scratch, or have you relied on existing frameworks? Open source or commercial solutions?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
