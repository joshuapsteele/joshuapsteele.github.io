      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I’ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and &lt;em&gt;trapped&lt;/em&gt; often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and <em>trapped</em> often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.</p>
<p>I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!</p>
<p>However, as I see it, I’m writing it out here for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To commit publicly to seeking out counseling</strong> now that I’ve started my first try of medication.</li>
<li><strong>In case anyone else out there</strong>, currently experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, etc., <strong>needs a nudge to seek out help sooner rather than later</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If #2 above refers to you, please know that you’re not alone! Please don’t let pride or anything else get in the way of receiving the help that you need.</p>
