      <title>My Coding Bootcamp Journey: How a Pastor Became a Programmer</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/my-coding-bootcamp-journey-how-a-pastor-became-a-programmer/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 17:42:02 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Bible shortly before my first semester of college, I realized that what I was studying was not going to make me rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, throughout undergrad, seminary, and into a Ph.D. program in theology, the notion of “bi-vocational ministry” (serving the church while also making money outside of the church doing something else) was on my radar screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for a few months between finishing seminary and starting my Ph.D. program, I tried to teach myself the basics of web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Ruby on Rails. (I signed up for an account on &lt;a href=&#34;https://teamtreehouse.com/&#34;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&#34;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; and I got to work!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Bible shortly before my first semester of college, I realized that what I was studying was not going to make me rich.</p>
<p>So, throughout undergrad, seminary, and into a Ph.D. program in theology, the notion of “bi-vocational ministry” (serving the church while also making money outside of the church doing something else) was on my radar screen.</p>
<p>In fact, for a few months between finishing seminary and starting my Ph.D. program, I tried to teach myself the basics of web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Ruby on Rails. (I signed up for an account on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> and on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> and I got to work!)</p>
<p>However, once I got accepted into a Ph.D. program (and realized that I needed to learn how to read in German ASAP in order to pass a translation exam), my programming learning fell by the wayside.</p>
<p>While a full-time Ph.D. student, I got some basic web design experience as the Managing Editor of a website. Most of my time was spent using WordPress, but I knew just enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous (i.e., to fix small problems).</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">the Ph.D.</a> did not go as planned. (More on that some other time.) Neither did that part-time website job. So, after months of searching unsuccessfully for church (or church-adjacent) work, I resurrected the idea of teaching myself how to code. I dove back into freeCodeCamp’s curriculum and started chipping away.</p>
<p>But it was slow going. Getting a tech job seemed like an impossible dream. And, although there’s a TON of information online, I desperately craved having teachers and fellow students I could talk to. (I’m a big fan of asking questions. All the time.) I wanted some personal help in order to put things into context, to see the big picture and the path forward to a job.</p>
<p>When I first started learning how to code again, there were always enough church-related job opportunities to keep me distracted from coding. After all, I had studied the Bible and theology for over a decade. My training was church-focused (<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/portfolio/cv/">just look at my C.V.</a>). So, if there were a church-focused job out there for me, obviously I should focus on finding it. Right?</p>
<p>After a particularly devastating disappointment (I was offered a church-adjacent marketing position that was then rescinded within 48 hours), I decided to go all-in on a coding bootcamp.</p>
<p>I’ll say more about my bootcamp selection process in another post. But I had my eyes on <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a> because (1) they published their job placement numbers (to <a href="https://cirr.org/">CIRR</a>), (2) they had a campus in Pittsburgh (where we were moving), and (3) their <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/coding-bootcamp/full-time-coding-bootcamp/">curriculum</a> contained not just coding information, but also a job-search component.</p>
<p>So, we spent just over $15,000 on the 14-week bootcamp in the Fall of 2021.</p>
<p>It was one of the most intense learning periods in my entire life! But I loved having teachers and fellow students that I could ask questions to. And I thoroughly benefited from the career coaching components of the bootcamp.</p>
<p>Tech Elevator not only taught me the (1) fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java and (2) the basics of responsive web design. It also helped me revise and re-frame my experience to help me find a tech job. I rewrote my resume. I developed an “elevator pitch.” I prepared for common interview questions, both at the HR and the technical level (the dreaded whiteboarding experience!).</p>
<p>Tech Elevator hooked us students up with a handful of initial “matchmaking interviews,” one of which led me to my current position! This was a HUGE help because, without a computer science degree or industry experience, it can be a pain to get past the initial application phase.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve worked as a software engineer for a year, I can say that doing a coding bootcamp was one of the best investments I’ve ever made.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, it’s not for everyone. I would only recommend a bootcamp if you are a highly motivated learner. There’s a lot of information to find and digest, and you need to have a real hunger for learning (and a willingness to make mistakes and be wrong as you figure things out).</p>
<p>If you’re considering doing a bootcamp, <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/coding-aptitude-test/">take Tech Elevator’s Coding Aptitude Test for free</a>! And dive into free “learn to code” resources online (like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> or <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>) to see if you like the kind of thinking that’s required to do software development!</p>
<p>That’s all for now, but I plan to keep blogging about my journey into tech. So, if you’ve got any questions you’d like me to answer, please let me know in a comment below! (Or use <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/contact/">the contact form</a> to email me.)</p>
