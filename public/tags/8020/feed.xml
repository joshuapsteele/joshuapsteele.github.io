&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where in your life or your work are you currently pursuing comfort, when what&amp;rsquo;s called for is a little discomfort?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you holding yourself to, and judging yourself by, standards of productivity or performance that are impossible to meet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways have you yet to accept the fact that you are who you are, not the person you think you ought to be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel like you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you spend your days differently if you didn&amp;rsquo;t care so much about seeing your actions reach fruition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Ten Tools for Embracing Finitude</title>

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt a &amp;ldquo;fixed volume&amp;rdquo; approach to productivity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep two todo lists, one unbounded and one limited to a certain number of items (max 10); you can&amp;rsquo;t add a task to the second list until you&amp;rsquo;ve completed a task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might also need an &amp;ldquo;On Hold&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Waiting For&amp;rdquo; todo list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set predetermined boundaries for your daily work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on only one big project at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide in advance what to &amp;ldquo;fail&amp;rdquo; at (&amp;ldquo;strategic underachievement&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on what you&amp;rsquo;ve already completed, not just on what&amp;rsquo;s left to complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consolidate your caring (pick your battles!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace boring, single-purpose technology (like the Kindle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek out novelty in the mundane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a &amp;ldquo;researcher&amp;rdquo; in relationships (be curious, on purpose)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate instantaneous generosity (act on the impulse to be generous right away)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice doing nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

<p>SOURCE: T. Edward Damer, <em>Attacking Faulty Reasoning: A Practical Guide to Fallacy-Free Arguments</em>, 6th ed (Australia ; Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Cengage Learning, 2009), 7–8.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-fallibility-principle">1. The Fallibility Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>Each participant in a discussion of a disputed issue should be willing to accept the fact that he or she is <strong>fallible</strong>, which means that <strong>one must acknowledge that one’s own initial view may not be the most defensible position on the question</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="2-the-truth-seeking-principle">2. The Truth-Seeking Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>Each participant should be committed to the task of <strong>earnestly searching for the truth or at least the most defensible position on the issue at stake</strong>. Therefore, one should be willing to examine alternative positions seriously, look for insights in the positions of others, and allow other participants to present arguments for or raise objections to any position held on an issue.</p></blockquote><h2 id="3-the-clarity-principle">3. The Clarity Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>The formulations of all positions, defenses, and attacks should be <strong>free of any kind of linguistic confusion and clearly separated from other positions and issues</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>In the seventh edition, the following is added:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is particularly important to <strong>define carefully any key words</strong> used in an argument or criticism that may be unclear or misunderstood.</p></blockquote><h2 id="4-the-burden-of-proof-principle">4. The Burden-of-Proof Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>The <strong>burden of proof for any position usually rests on the participant who sets forth the position</strong>. If and when an opponent asks, the proponent should provide an argument for that position.</p></blockquote><h2 id="5-the-principle-of-charity">5. The Principle of Charity</h2>
<blockquote><p>If a participant’s argument is reformulated by an opponent, it should be <strong>carefully expressed in its strongest possible version that is consistent with what is believed to be the original intention of the arguer</strong>. If there is any question about that intention or about any implicit part of the argument, <strong>the arguer should be given the benefit of any doubt in the reformulation and/or, when possible, given the opportunity to amend it</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="6-the-structural-principle">6. The Structural Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>One who argues for or against a position should <strong>use an argument that meets the fundamental structural requirements of a well-formed argument</strong>. Such an argument does not use reasons that contradict each other, that contradict the conclusion, or that explicitly or implicitly assume the truth of the conclusion. Neither does it draw any invalid deductive inferences.</p></blockquote><h2 id="7-the-relevance-principle">7. The Relevance Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>One who presents an argument for or against a position should <strong>set forth only reasons whose truth provides some evidence for the truth of the conclusion</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="8-the-acceptability-principle">8. The Acceptability Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>One who presents an argument for or against a position should <strong>provide reasons that are likely to be accepted by a mature, rational person and that meet standard criteria of acceptability</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="9-the-sufficiency-principle">9. The Sufficiency Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>One who presents an argument for or against a position should <strong>attempt to provide relevant and acceptable reasons of the right kind, that together are sufficient in number and weight to justify the acceptance of the conclusion</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="10-the-rebuttal-principle">10. The Rebuttal Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>One who presents an argument for or against a position should <strong>include in the argument an effective rebuttal to all anticipated serious criticisms of the argument that may be brought against it or against the position it supports</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="11-the-suspension-of-judgment-principle">11. The Suspension-of-Judgment Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>If no position is defended by a good argument, or if two or more positions seem to be defended with equal strength, one should, in most cases, suspend judgment about the issue</strong>. If practical considerations seem to require a more immediate decision, one should weigh the relative benefits or harm connected with the consequences of suspending judgment and decide the issue on those grounds.</p></blockquote><h2 id="12-the-resolution-principle">12. The Resolution Principle</h2>
<blockquote><p>An issue should be considered <strong>resolved if the argument for one of the alternative positions is a structurally sound one that uses relevant and acceptable reasons that together provide sufficient grounds to justify the conclusion and that also includes an effective rebuttal to all serious criticisms of the argument and/or the position it supports</strong>. Unless one can demonstrate that the argument has not met these conditions more successfully than any argument presented for alternative positions, one is obligated to accept its conclusion and consider the issue to be settled. If the argument is subsequently found by any participant to be flawed in a way that raises new doubts about the merit of the position it supports, one is obligated to reopen the issue for further consideration and resolution.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following checklist, found on pages 155–56 of Alan Jacobs’s excellent book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/33TtBRv&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link), is a worthy addition to “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” (mentioned in my previous post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-come-up-with-rules-for-conversation/&#34;&gt;“Help me come up with ‘rules for conversation’!”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-embed-amazon-kindle wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-amazon&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;wp-block-embed__wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;550&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?preview=inline&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;ref_=k4w_oembed_Eii2WAqN2ej4WE&amp;asin=0451499603&amp;tag=joshuapsteele-20&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%&#34; title=&#34;How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds&#34; type=&#34;text/html&#34; width=&#34;750&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;Emphasis added in **bold**.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When faced with provocation to respond to what someone has said, give it five minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. Take a walk, or weed the garden, or chop some vegetables. Get your body involved: your body knows the rhythms to live by, and if your mind falls into your body’s rhythm, you’ll have a better chance of thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value learning over debating&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t “talk for victory.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As best you can, online and off, &lt;strong&gt;avoid the people who fan flames&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to respond to what everyone else is responding to in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have to respond to what everyone else is responding to&lt;/strong&gt; in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness, or else lose your status in your community, then you should realize that &lt;strong&gt;it’s not a community but rather an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/&#34;&gt;Inner Ring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gravitate&lt;/strong&gt; as best you can, in every way you can, &lt;strong&gt;toward people who seem to value genuine community and can handle disagreement with equanimity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek out the best and fairest-minded of people whose views you disagree with.&lt;/strong&gt; Listen to them for a time without responding. Whatever they say, &lt;em&gt;think it over&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patiently, and as honestly as you can, &lt;strong&gt;assess your &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repugnance&#34;&gt;repugnances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes &lt;strong&gt;the “ick factor”&lt;/strong&gt; is telling; sometimes it’s a distraction from what matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of &lt;strong&gt;metaphors&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;myths&lt;/strong&gt; that do too much heavy cognitive lifting; notice what your &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terministic_screen&#34;&gt;terministic screens&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt; [See pages 90–91] are directing your attention to-and what they’re directing your attention &lt;em&gt;away from&lt;/em&gt;; look closely for hidden metaphors and beware the power of myth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to &lt;strong&gt;describe others’ positions in the language that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; use, without indulging in in-other-wordsing.&lt;/strong&gt; [See pg. 106: “We see it every day. Someone points at an argument—a blog post, say, or an op-ed column—and someone else replies, ‘In other words, you’re saying … ‘ And inevitably the argument, when put &lt;em&gt;in other words&lt;/em&gt;, is revealed to be vacuous or wicked.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be &lt;strong&gt;brave&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Help me come up with “rules for conversation”!</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-come-up-with-rules-for-conversation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2019 20:26:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-come-up-with-rules-for-conversation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my role as Managing Editor for AnglicanPastor.com, I’m realizing the need to develop some “rules for conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the tone that we’re after as “clarity and charity,” which is an excellent summary. However, to guide our blogposts and comments, I think we need something more detailed and concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” seem like excellent starting points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, if you have any further suggestions, please let me know in the comments!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my role as Managing Editor for AnglicanPastor.com, I’m realizing the need to develop some “rules for conversation.”</p>
<p>We describe the tone that we’re after as “clarity and charity,” which is an excellent summary. However, to guide our blogposts and comments, I think we need something more detailed and concrete.</p>
<p>With that in mind, “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” seem like excellent starting points.</p>
<p><strong>But, if you have any further suggestions, please let me know in the comments!</strong></p>
<h2 id="rapoports-rules">Rapoport’s Rules</h2>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/use-rapoports-rules-for-better-conversations-and-disagreements/">posted about these rules before on my blog</a>. Click that link for a bit more information. Here are the rules.</p>
<p>When critiquing someone else:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should <strong>attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”</strong></li>
<li>You should <strong>list any points of agreement</strong> (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</li>
<li>You should <strong>mention anything you have learned from your target.</strong></li>
<li>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of <strong>rebuttal or criticism</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adlers-advice">Adler’s Advice</h2>
<p>Rapoport’s Rules are an excellent start, but surely there’s more out there!</p>
<p>Mortimer Adler’s book, <em>How to Speak How to Listen</em> contains some practical advice in Chapter 11 on “How to Make Conversation Profitable and Pleasurable.”</p>
<p><em>(NOTE: Page numbers below are from the Scribd e-book. They might not perfectly coincide with the hardcover or paperback.)</em></p>
<h3 id="factorsobstacles">Factors/Obstacles</h3>
<p>First, Adler highlights four factors or obstacles that need to be recognized and overcome for a successful conversation to take place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: We must, of course, use it, but “it is a very imperfect medium of communication—cloudy, obscure, full of ambiguities and pitfalls of misunderstanding.” (136).</li>
<li><strong>Emotion</strong>(s): Perfectly fine in heart-to-heart talks, but “emotions are entirely out of place in impersonal conversations that have as their goal the achievement of better understanding and the attainment of agreement about the resolution of purely intellectual issues.” (138).</li>
<li><strong>Self-Knowledge</strong>: “Understanding one’s self is a necessary condition for understanding anyone else.” (138).</li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong>: “Saying what you mean is one of the hardest things in the world to do. Listening to what others say in order to discern what they mean is equally hard. Both call for expenditures of intellectual energy that many persons are loath to make.” (140).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Pick the right place and occasion for a conversation</strong>, one that provides sufficient time for carrying it on and one that is free from the annoyance of distractions that interrupt or divert it.” (140).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Know in advance what kind of conversation you are trying to have.</strong>” (141).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“For whatever kind of serious conversation it is to be, <strong>select the right people with whom to have it</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Don’t try to discuss everything with everybody. …</li>
<li>“Most important of all, never engage in the discussion of a problem with someone you know in advance has a closed mind on that subject.” (142).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Certain matters are undiscussable and, therefore, one should avoid discussing them</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“The familiar maxim, <em>de gustibus non disputandum est</em> [Latin: “about tastes, it should not be disputed”], is more often disobeyed than honored, and yet violating this rule always turns two-way talk into nothing more than an exchange of personal prejudices. …</li>
<li>“Only about matters concerning which objective truth can be ascertained is it worthwhile to engage in argument of one sort or another for the sake of ascertaining it.” (143–44).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t listen only to yourself</strong>.” (144).</p>
<ol>
<li>“All of us have had the experience of conversation that proceeds in the following manner. Brown speaks while Jones remains silent, not listening to what Brown says, but only waiting politely for Brown to finish, at which time Jones enters the conversation with a statement of something on his mind that may have no relation whatsoever to what Brown has just said. While Jones speaks, Brown also politely waits, but does not listen. When Jones finishes, Brown then expands on what he said earlier or talks about something else that in no way relates to what Jones has just expressed.</li>
<li>“They might just as well have been in different rooms talking to themselves, because that is the only person they have been listening to.” (144–45).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“A closely related rule calls on you to <strong>listen to a question with an effort to understand it before answering it, and then with an effort to address yourself to the question in the light of your understanding of it</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Many persons take questions as nothing more than signals for them to speak, uttering whatever happens to be on their mind at the moment, whether or not it has any relevance to the question that calls for their response.</li>
<li>“If you have any sense at all that you may not understand the question you have been asked, don’t try to answer it. Instead ask your interrogator to explain the question, to rephrase it in some way that makes it more intelligible to you.</li>
<li>“There is no point in trying to answer questions you do not completely understand. Keep at the task of reaching for that understanding before you attempt to answer.” (145).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“A parallel rule, if you are on the questioning rather than the answering end of a conversation, is to <strong>ask your questions as clearly and as intelligibly as possible</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“There is still one more rule about questions in relation to good serious conversation. <strong>Some people think that they are engaging in conversation when they ask another person one question after another, receiving each answer without commenting on it, and without any connection between the questions asked in sequence. This may be a form of interrogation that is useful under certain conditions and for certain purposes, but it is not a conversation in which the interchanges of two-way talk advance significantly from one point to another</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t interrupt while someone else is speaking</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t be rude</strong> by engaging in a side conversation while someone to whom you should be listening is talking.</p>
<ol>
<li>“<strong>At the same time, don’t be too polite. One should always be civil in the tone and manner of one’s utterances, but excessive politeness should not restrain one from saying what is on one’s mind.</strong></li>
<li>“If you think what you have to say may be offensive, try to phrase it in such a way that giving offense is avoided, but do not clam up when what you have to say deserves saying.” (145-46).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Recognize that <strong>anything that takes time should have a beginning, a middle, and an end.</strong> This is as true of a conversation as of a play or a symphony. …</p>
<ol>
<li>“The beginning should set the stage for the conversation by focusing on the theme—the problem, the question, the subject to be discussed.</li>
<li>“The middle, which should run for a longer time, should be devoted to exploring the problem, the question, or subject and should elicit all the differences of opinion that are relevant to it, with support for these opinions to be given by argument.</li>
<li>“The end should bring the conversation to a conclusion—a decision reached if the conversation has a practical purpose, a position agreed upon if the matter is theoretical.</li>
<li>“If agreement is beyond reach, then the conclusion may involve suspended judgment and the tabling of the matter in question for further conversation, and perhaps resolution, at a later time.” (145–47).</li>

<h3 id="recommendations-for-impersonal-conversations">Recommendations for Impersonal Conversations</h3>
<h4 id="intellectual-rules">Intellectual Rules</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“If you are an active participant in a conversation or discussion, your first obligation is to <strong>focus on the question to be considered.</strong> What is the problem to be solved, the issue to be settled, the subject to be explored? <strong>If the matter is complex</strong> and has a number of component elements, those engaged in the conversation would be well advised to <strong>break it up into its parts, label them, and put them in some order.</strong>” (150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Stick to the issue.</strong> Stay within the framework of the subject under consideration, either as a whole or with respect to one or another of its parts. Don’t wander off and talk about something else or intrude irrelevancies into the course of the conversation.” (150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Stick to the issue or the point, <strong>but don’t beat it to death.</strong> Don’t stay on it forever. Keep moving on to the next point when this one has been sufficiently explored or discussed.” (151).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Individuals not only bring unacknowledged assumptions to a conversation in which they are engaged, they also take part in it without knowing what their blind spots are—matters concerning which they lack understanding and have difficulty in attaining.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>“Like unacknowledged assumptions, blind spots can ruin a conversation or at least prevent the minds engaged in it from really meeting.”</li>
<li>“Be on the alert to <strong>recognize when you are failing to understand something and press for help in understanding it</strong>.</li>
<li>“You should <strong>be aware that you have certain preconceptions and assumptions, and try to dredge them up from the recesses of your mind and lay them on the table for everyone to examine</strong>.</li>
<li>“Since few conversations begin at the beginning and different things are taken for granted by the persons talking with one another, the rule might better be stated as follows. <strong>Ask your companions to grant the assumptions you wish to make, and state your own assumptions when it comes their turn to ask you for them.</strong>” (151–152).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Avoid the most obvious fallacies.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>“<strong>Never argue about facts; look them up</strong> if you wish to settle a difference of opinion about them.</li>
<li>“<strong>Never cite authorities as if the citation of them were conclusive.</strong>”</li>
<li><strong>Don’t argue <em>ad hominem</em></strong>, “attacking persons rather than attacking the point being considered.”</li>
<li>“When the conversation is theoretical rather than practical, when it is concerned with getting at the truth about a certain matter, then <strong>taking a vote should never be regarded as settling the question in issue.</strong>”</li>
<li>“<strong>Beware of examples.</strong> They often prove too much or too little and they are seldom perfectly relevant. … Examples can be useful, but only to illustrate what you are saying, never to prove it.”</li>
<li>“Examples should be treated like assumptions. Just as assumptions should be allowed to exert whatever force they have only with everyone’s explicit acknowledgment and consent, so <strong>examples should stand only if everyone sees their relevance and is aware that they are being used to illustrate a point, not to prove it.</strong>” (153–56).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="emotional-rules">Emotional Rules</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“catch yourself or the other person getting angry. The signs that this is happening are many and various:</p>
<ol>
<li>you or he start to shout;</li>
<li>you or he become repetitious, raising your voice with each reiteration of the point;</li>
<li>you or he become overpositive, expressing this by pounding the table or by other forms of gesturing;</li>
<li>you or he indulge in sarcasm, in teasing, in baiting, or in getting the other’s argument laughed at;</li>
<li>or either of you resorts to the kind of irrelevant ad hominems mentioned above.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>When you find yourself getting annoyed, angry, or overexcited in the course of an argument, leave the room and give yourself time to cool off.</strong>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Do not allow an impersonal discussion to become a personal quarrel.</strong> Argument is not aggression. There is no point at all in trying to win an argument simply by putting your opponent down or beating him up.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Be aware of the results of emotional disorder on your own part.</strong> … There is certainly no point in winning an argument for personal or emotional reasons that impel you to try to get the better of the other person when your mind either knows now or will recognize later that he was right and you were wrong.” (156–57).</p>

<h4 id="you-must-understand-before-you-can-agree-or-disagree">You must understand before you can agree or disagree.</h4>
<blockquote><p>The first rule to be followed is this. <strong>Do not disagree—or, for that matter, do not agree—with anyone else unless you are sure you understand the position the other person is taking.</strong> To disagree before you understand is impertinent. To agree is inane.</p>
<p>To make sure that you understand, before you disagree or agree, <strong>exercise the courtesy of asking the other person the following question: “Do I understand you to say that . . . ?”</strong> Fill in the blank by phrasing in your own words what you think you hear the other person saying. <strong>He may respond to this by saying to you, “No, that is not what I said or not what I meant. My position is as follows.”</strong> Then, after the other person has restated his position for you, you should once again try to state in your own words what you have understood the other to say. If the other still dissents from your interpretation, <strong>you must continue with this question and answer procedure until the other tells you that you have at last caught the point, that you understand him precisely as he wishes to be understood. Only then do you have the grounds indispensable for intelligent and reasonable disagreement or agreement.</strong>” (159–60).</p></blockquote><h4 id="fully-understood-disagreement-and-fully-understood-agreement">Fully understood disagreement and fully understood agreement.</h4>
<blockquote><p>“Understanding with disagreement—fully understood disagreement—constitutes a minimal meeting of minds. A more complete meeting of minds consists in understanding with agreement—fully understood agreement.” (161).</p></blockquote><h4 id="there-are-4-kinds-of-genuine-disagreement">There are 4 kinds of genuine disagreement.</h4>
<blockquote><p>“If you find yourself in genuine disagreement with the position taken by another, you should be able to explain the grounds of your disagreement, by saying one or more of the following things.</p>
<ol>
<li>“I think you hold that position because <strong>you are uninformed</strong> about certain facts or reasons that have a critical bearing on it.” Then be prepared to point out the information you think the other lacks and which, if possessed, would result in a change of mind.</li>
<li>“I think you hold that position because <strong>you are misinformed</strong> about matters that are critically relevant.” Then be prepared to indicate the mistakes the other has made, which, if corrected, would lead the other to abandon the position taken.</li>
<li>“I think you are sufficiently well informed and have a firm grasp of the evidence and reasons that support your position, but <strong>you have drawn the wrong conclusions from your premises because you have made mistakes in reasoning</strong>. You have made fallacious inferences.” Then be ready to point out those logical errors which, if corrected, would bring the other person to a different conclusion.</li>
<li>“I think you have made none of the foregoing errors and that you have proceeded by sound reasoning from adequate grounds for the conclusion you have reached, <strong>but I also think that your thinking about the subject is incomplete</strong>. You should have gone further than you did and reached other conclusions that somewhat alter or qualify the one you did reach.” Then be able to point out what these other conclusions are and how they alter or qualify the position taken by the person with whom you disagree.” (162–63).</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m reading Walter Sinnott-Armstrong’s excellent book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2BNTlTq&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think Again: How to Reason and Argue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it (on pages 25–26), I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules&#34;&gt;“Rapoport’s Rules.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First formulated by mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport and discussed by Daniel Dennett (&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2NmrH4m&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 31–35), here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1: You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
