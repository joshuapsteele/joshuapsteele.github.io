In sum, then, the issue is whether I or J.\nMy own view is that K. Though I concede that L, I still maintain that M. For example, N. Although some might object that O, I would reply that P. The issue is important because Q.\nIntroducing What “They Say” A number of have recently suggested that X. It has become common today to dismiss X. In their recent work, A and B have offered harsh critiques of C for D. Introducing “Standard Views” Americans today tend to believe that X. Conventional wisdom has it that X. Common sense seems to dictate that X. The standard way of thinking about topic X has it that Y. It is often said that X. My whole life I have heard it said that X. You would think that X. Many people assume that X. Making What “They Say” Something You Say I’ve always believed that X. When I was a child, I used to think that X. Although I should know better by now, I cannot help thinking that X. At the same time that I believe X, I also believe Y.

Although X does not say so directly, she apparently assumes that Y. While they rarely admit as much, X often take for granted that Y. Introducing An Ongoing Debate In discussions of X, one controversial issue has been A. On the one hand, B argues C. On the other hand, D contends E. Others even maintain F. My own view is G. When it comes to the topic of X, most of us will readily agree that A. Where this agreement usually ends, however, is on the question of B. Whereas some are convinced that C, others maintain that D. In conclusion, then, as I suggested earlier, defenders of X can’t have it both ways. Their assertion that Y is contradicted by their claim that Z. Capturing Authorial Action X acknowledges that .

<li>In discussions of X, one controversial issue has been A. On the one hand, B argues C. On the other hand, D contends E. Others even maintain F. My own view is G.</li>
<li>When it comes to the topic of X, most of us will readily agree that A. Where this agreement usually ends, however, is on the question of B. Whereas some are convinced that C, others maintain that D.</li>
<li>In conclusion, then, as I suggested earlier, defenders of X can’t have it both ways. Their assertion that Y is contradicted by their claim that Z.</li>
