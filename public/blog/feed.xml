&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where in your life or your work are you currently pursuing comfort, when what&amp;rsquo;s called for is a little discomfort?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you holding yourself to, and judging yourself by, standards of productivity or performance that are impossible to meet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways have you yet to accept the fact that you are who you are, not the person you think you ought to be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel like you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you spend your days differently if you didn&amp;rsquo;t care so much about seeing your actions reach fruition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Ten Tools for Embracing Finitude</title>

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt a &amp;ldquo;fixed volume&amp;rdquo; approach to productivity
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep two todo lists, one unbounded and one limited to a certain number of items (max 10); you can&amp;rsquo;t add a task to the second list until you&amp;rsquo;ve completed a task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might also need an &amp;ldquo;On Hold&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Waiting For&amp;rdquo; todo list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set predetermined boundaries for your daily work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on only one big project at a time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide in advance what to &amp;ldquo;fail&amp;rdquo; at (&amp;ldquo;strategic underachievement&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on what you&amp;rsquo;ve already completed, not just on what&amp;rsquo;s left to complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consolidate your caring (pick your battles!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace boring, single-purpose technology (like the Kindle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek out novelty in the mundane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a &amp;ldquo;researcher&amp;rdquo; in relationships (be curious, on purpose)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate instantaneous generosity (act on the impulse to be generous right away)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice doing nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to blog more regularly, and I love answering questions. So &lt;a href=&#34;https://weblogpomo.club/challenges&#34;&gt;the &amp;ldquo;WeblogPoMo AMA&amp;rdquo; challenge caught my eye&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this challenge I want to foster writer interaction: write a blog post starting with a question—the AMA—and then answer the question yourself in the blog post. Others will likewise write AMA/question posts, but also answer the AMA/questions from other bloggers, linking to their initial post. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/10/weblogpomo-challenges#ama-challenge&#34;&gt;brainstormed a bit on this idea&lt;/a&gt; when I first thought about creating WeblogPoMo Challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>God&#39;s Economy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In God&amp;rsquo;s economy, the most important people are not the billionaire, the business owner, or even the blue-collar worker. Instead, in God&amp;rsquo;s economy, the most important people are the widow, the orphan, and the immigrant. Which is to say, the poor and the powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve previously gone into depth on &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/bible-poverty-proverbs/&#34;&gt;what the book of Proverbs has to say about poverty and wealth&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/christians-and-wealth/&#34;&gt;how Christians should think about wealth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more biblical passages relevant to the topic. All quotes are from the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve previously gone into depth on <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/bible-poverty-proverbs/">what the book of Proverbs has to say about poverty and wealth</a>, as well as <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/christians-and-wealth/">how Christians should think about wealth</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some more biblical passages relevant to the topic. All quotes are from the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV):</p>
<h2 id="exodus-222124">Exodus 22:21–24</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt. You shall not abuse any widow or orphan. If you do abuse them, when they cry out to me, I will surely heed their cry; my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children orphans.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="deuteronomy-241415">Deuteronomy 24:14–15</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall not withhold the wages of poor and needy laborers, whether other Israelites or aliens who reside in your land in one of your towns. You shall pay them their wages daily before sunset, because they are poor and their livelihood depends on them; otherwise they might cry to the LORD against you, and you would incur guilt.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="deuteronomy-241718">Deuteronomy 24:17–18</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall not deprive a resident alien or an orphan of justice; you shall not take a widow’s garment in pledge. Remember that you were a slave in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you from there; therefore I command you to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="deuteronomy-241922">Deuteronomy 24:19–22</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be left for the alien, the orphan, and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all your undertakings. When you beat your olive trees, do not strip what is left; it shall be for the alien, the orphan, and the widow. When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not glean what is left; it shall be for the alien, the orphan, and the widow. Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="proverbs-222223">Proverbs 22:22–23</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not rob the poor because they are poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate; for the LORD pleads their cause and despoils of life those who despoil them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="isaiah-5867">Isaiah 58:6–7</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover them, and not to hide yourself from your own kin?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="amos-846">Amos 8:4–6</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land, saying, “When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale? We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances, buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="luke-121521">Luke 12:15–21</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>And he said to them, “Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.” Then he told them a parable: “The land of a rich man produced abundantly. And he thought to himself, ‘What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?’ Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.’ But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="luke-141214">Luke 14:12–14</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>He said also to the one who had invited him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="luke-181825">Luke 18:18–25</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A certain ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honor your father and mother.’” He replied, “I have kept all these since my youth.” When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “There is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.” But when he heard this, he became sad; for he was very rich. Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="james-127">James 1:27</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="james-516">James 5:1–6</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Come now, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming to you. Your riches have rotted, and your clothes are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you, and it will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure for the last days. Listen! The wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered the righteous one, who does not resist you.</p>

      <title>Requiem for a Cousin on His Birthday</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/requiem-for-a-cousin-on-his-birthday/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2024 09:00:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/requiem-for-a-cousin-on-his-birthday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today should have been my cousin Eric&amp;rsquo;s 32nd birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, having lost him earlier this year to some serious health complications after a devastating motorcycle accident, we gathered to remember him and celebrate his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another member of our family gone too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two passages of Scripture came to mind as I thought about Eric today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this one from Ecclesiastes (which I &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/20150424my-uncle-timothy-steele/&#34;&gt;previously wrote a bit about after the untimely death of my Uncle Tim&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today should have been my cousin Eric&rsquo;s 32nd birthday.</p>
<p>Instead, having lost him earlier this year to some serious health complications after a devastating motorcycle accident, we gathered to remember him and celebrate his life.</p>
<p>Another member of our family gone too soon.</p>
<p>Two passages of Scripture came to mind as I thought about Eric today.</p>
<p>First, this one from Ecclesiastes (which I <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/20150424my-uncle-timothy-steele/">previously wrote a bit about after the untimely death of my Uncle Tim</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is better to go to the house of mourning<br>
than to go to the house of feasting,<br>
for this is the end of everyone,<br>
and the living will lay it to heart.<br>
Sorrow is better than laughter,<br>
for by sadness of countenance the heart is made glad.<br>
(Ecclesiastes 7:2-3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I turn 33 next month. Today was the first memorial service I&rsquo;ve attended for someone younger than me.</p>
<p>Life is short. None of us knows how much time we have left.</p>
<p>Now, there are many lessons to draw from this, but one of them is that we should speak well of people, we should &ldquo;eulogize&rdquo; them, before they die. If you&rsquo;ve got life-giving words for someone, even if they&rsquo;re hard words, don&rsquo;t wait! Don&rsquo;t wait until the funeral to say what should have been said before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful that I got the chance to visit Eric in the hospital before he died. And to tell him that I loved him, and that I was very grateful for his friendship when we were growing up.</p>
<p>Which brings to mind the second Scripture passage, this time from Proverbs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A friend loves at all times,<br>
and a brother is born for adversity.<br>
(Proverbs 17:17)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As kids, Eric was a brother, a relative, who helped me through some tough times at what I&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;the bottom of the cousin food chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dad was 9th of 10 kids. Eric&rsquo;s dad was 10th. So, by the time I came around and Eric joined me 11 months later, we were the two youngest boys in a large group of cousins.</p>
<p>Now, I mean no shade to my other older cousins. I think we&rsquo;ve all reconciled by now!</p>
<p>But, as an overweight little kid, I was often picked-on by my older cousins. And Eric, as a scrawny even littler kid, was right there with me.</p>
<p>I mean, we got ditched by the older cousins more times than I could count. And, even when we were allowed to play tag, hide-and-seek, etc., well, let&rsquo;s just say we were never coming out on top.</p>
<p>So we developed a special bond. The youngest cousins.</p>
<p>Sure, some of it was due to sheer necessity of birth order, but Eric was always a good friend to me.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t remember him ever making fun of me for my weight or anything else. Instead, he was always the one I looked for when we had a family gathering. The answer to the question &ldquo;is Eric going to be there?&rdquo; always set my expectations for how any given get-together was going to go.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we got on each other&rsquo;s nerves and had a few fights of our own.</p>
<p>But I mostly remember Eric&rsquo;s kindness.</p>
<p>He taught me how to cook ramen noodles on the stovetop. He taught me how to play Texas Hold &lsquo;Em. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he first taught me how BB and Airsoft guns worked, and we shot our fair share of targets (including, with the Airsoft guns, each other) in his backyard.</p>
<p>We rode bikes. Played catch. Did random wannabe outdoorsman stuff in the woods.</p>
<p>Eric was like the younger brother I never had.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad he&rsquo;s gone. And, even though I&rsquo;m glad I got to thank him for his friendship before he died, I wish I would have stayed in better touch with him as we grew older.</p>
<p>Death is terrible. Just really f***ing awful.</p>
<p>My consolation as I mourn yet another death is that I believe, in spite of all the suffering around me, that God hates Death even more than I do. I believe that Christ has defeated Death and that, one day, God&rsquo;s patient, suffering love will redeem all things.</p>
<p>Meditating on the untimely death of his son (also named Eric), and on the risen Christ&rsquo;s invitation to St. Thomas to put his hands into his wounds, Nicholas Wolterstorff writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To believe in Christ&rsquo;s rising from the grave is to accept it as a sign of our own rising from our graves. If for each of us it was our destiny to be obliterated, and for all of us together it was our destiny to fade away without a trace, then not Christ&rsquo;s rising but my dear son&rsquo;s early dying would be the logo of our fate.</p>
<p>[&hellip;] To believe in Christ&rsquo;s rising and death&rsquo;s dying is also to live with the power and the challenge to rise up now from all our dark graves of suffering love. If sympathy for the world&rsquo;s wounds is not enlarged by our anguish, if love for those around us is not expanded, if gratitude for what is good does not flame up, if insight is not deepened, if commitment to what is important is not strengthened, if aching for a new day is not intensified, if hope is weakened and faith diminished, if from the experience of death there comes nothing good, then death has won. Then death, be proud.</p>
<p>So I shall struggle to live the reality of Christ&rsquo;s dying and death&rsquo;s dying. In my living, my son&rsquo;s dying will not be the last word. But as I rise up, I bear the wounds of his death. My rising does not remove them. They mark me. If you want to know who I am, put your hand in.<br>
(Lament for a Son, 92).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s time of adversity has ended. For the rest of us, the adversities of life continue, including the mourning of those we&rsquo;ve lost.</p>
<p>But life, laughter, joy, and friendship also endure. Death will not have the final word.</p>
<p>So, put your faith in the risen, wounded Christ. Join Him in the fight against Death.</p>
<p>And, if you&rsquo;re suffering, then, in memory of my cousin Eric, don&rsquo;t suffer alone.</p>
<p>Instead, look around and find someone else who needs a friend for tough times. A brother—a cousin, even!—born for adversity.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lest &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/i-love-my-kids-but-i-sometimes-regret-having-them/&#34;&gt;my previous parenting post&lt;/a&gt; suggest that things are all doom-and-gloom at the Steele-haus, here are 10 things I love about my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got to baptize all 3 of them as babies, a poignant reminder that they are beloved children of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They all love books, which warms my nerdy heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way Eleanor (1yo) greets me. It used to be a very excited squeal. Now it’s “Ah! Daddy!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew (4yo) has a great memory for stories, especially Bible stories. I was redoing our fire pit, and spraying it with a hose to cut down on dust as I re-leveled the ground. Andrew: “Elijah put water on the fire, too!” (see 1 Kings 18).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eva (6yo) is smart as a whip. She asks great questions, and I’m looking forward to (re-)learning with her as she gets older.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eleanor’s recently learned how to do an overly-exaggerated “angry eyebrows” face, and I find it absolutely hilarious. She now does it to get a laugh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew loves Spiderman, and he goes back-and-forth on whether or not he thinks superheroes are real. Listening to him as he narrates Spiderman scenarios while running around in his Spiderman costume is always entertaining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eva will sometimes read books to Andrew and Eleanor. They will then imitate her–Andrew, by reciting stories from memory as he turns through the books, and Eleanor, by babbling to herself as she flips the pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can get them all to watch things with me like This Old House, DIY videos, tool reviews, etc. Partially because they’re all curious and enjoy learning about tools. Partially (OK, mostly) because they’re thankful they’re watching *something* on the TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’re all still young enough that they frequently want hugs and snuggles.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>I Love My Kids, But I Sometimes Regret Having Them</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love my kids, but I sometimes regret having them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pardon the clickbait-y title and opening sentence. But are we parents allowed to say that? Are we allowed to feel both of those things at once?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got a 6-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an almost-2-year-old. And, no, I don’t actually begrudge them their existence! I want what’s best for their lives and futures. And don’t get me wrong; &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/&#34;&gt;there are moments of laughter, poignancy, joy, etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love my kids, but I sometimes regret having them.</p>
<p>Pardon the clickbait-y title and opening sentence. But are we parents allowed to say that? Are we allowed to feel both of those things at once?</p>
<p>We’ve got a 6-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an almost-2-year-old. And, no, I don’t actually begrudge them their existence! I want what’s best for their lives and futures. And don’t get me wrong; <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/">there are moments of laughter, poignancy, joy, etc.</a></p>
<p>But they’re also driving me crazy.</p>
<p>The noise, chaos, and overstimulation have me frequently annoyed at my kids before they’ve even finished breakfast. I usually just stare into the middle distance during mealtimes. By the time they’ve all gone (back) to bed (for the final time), I just want to crawl into a dark, quiet hole.</p>
<p>If my wife weren’t such a rockstar, our family’s daily life would probably have fallen apart by now. But it’s wearing her down, too.</p>
<p>We’ve tried gentle parenting and not-so-gentle parenting. We <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=parenting+books&amp;crid=3QVJIF4D7G2D7&amp;sprefix=parenting%2Caps%2C183&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=joshuapsteele-20&amp;linkId=e2dc22d364345a0d1e9b31822e628163&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">read all the parenting books</a>. We try to learn, good and bad, from our own parents. We try to learn from other parents our age.</p>
<p>We’ve prayed for patience and wisdom, for ourselves and for our children. Like this prayer “For the Care of Children” from the <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZC2wSz">1979 Book of Common Prayer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almighty God, heavenly Father, you have blessed us with the joy and care of children: Give us calm strength and patient wisdom as we bring them up, that we may teach them to love whatever is just and true and good, following the example of our Savior Jesus Christ. <em>Amen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve tried to teach our kids how to deal with their big feelings in a healthy way. We’ve reminded them that, while they’re free to feel their feelings, they still need to make good choices about what they do with those feelings, because choices have consequences.</p>
<p>I know I’m not alone in this. I also know that all of this says more about me than it does about my kids. (“It’s me. Hi! I’m the problem. It’s me.”)</p>
<p>Other parents out there have more children, with worse behavior and fewer resources. Others out there desperately wish they had children, and are probably pretty upset with me right now, if they read this.</p>
<p>And yet, here we are. Are other parents as stressed-out as I am?</p>
<p>When I read the Surgeon General’s <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/parents/index.html">“Parents Under Pressure” Advisory</a>, that “parents are at their wits’ end” and there’s an “urgent need to better support parents, caregivers, and families,” I nod in exhausted agreement.</p>
<p>And I say a weary “amen” when I read this insightful opinion piece on how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/opinion/parenting-helicopter-ignoring.html">“Parents Should Ignore Their Children More Often.”</a> In it, Darby Saxbe suggests that “one of the best things parents can do — for ourselves as well as for our children — is to go about our own lives and tote our children along. You might call it mindful underparenting.” Saxbe isn’t suggesting parental neglect, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To be sure, when kids are upset, in danger or require guidance, parents can and should swoop in to help. But that is precisely the point: It is only by ignoring our children much of the time that we conserve the energy necessary to give them our full attention when they actually need it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brilliant. Right? But it’s not like we’re actively trying to be helicopter parents.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where I’m going with this, but it’s left me wondering what kind of societal, structural, and personal changes are required to help us parents endure and raise wise humans. You know, without collapsing into abandonment, abuse, alcoholism, or any of the other unhealthy ways of coping with parenting stress.</p>
<p>I’ll close with another quote from Saxbe’s opinion piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In other words, underparenting requires structural change, and not just the obvious changes that we think of as parental stress-relievers, such as family leave and paid child care. It also requires that as a society, we build back our tolerance for children in public spaces, as annoying and distracting as they can be, and create safe environments where lightly supervised kids can roam freely. In a society that treated children as a public good, we would keep a collective eye on all our kids — which would free us of the need to hover over our own.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. So let’s give all our kids, and the stressed-out parents we know and love, a big hug today. And think about how we can help raise the next generations — with minimal regrets.</p>
<p>(P.S. It’s not all doom-and-gloom at the Steele-haus. Here are <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/">10 things I love about my kids</a>.)</p>

      <title>Help, I&#39;m Addicted to Mini Toolkits: The EDC Tool Struggle Is Real</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/help-im-addicted-to-mini-toolkits-the-edc-tool-struggle-is-real/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 16:09:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/help-im-addicted-to-mini-toolkits-the-edc-tool-struggle-is-real/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.</p>
<p>Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).</p>
<p>It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.</p>
<p>OK, but what about these “mini toolkits”?</p>
<p>It all started when I got the <a href="https://amzn.to/3XVS6fv">Sunex Tools 44-Piece 1/4″ Drive Mini Dual Flex Head Ratchet with Socket &amp; Bit Set (9732)</a>. I love the extra SAE/Metric flexibility from the spline sockets. And it’s got basically every bit I’ve needed.</p>
<p>Those spline sockets in the Sunex are actually why I ended up returning <a href="https://amzn.to/3XM6KG2">the extremely popular Wera Tool-Check Plus kit</a> after giving it a try. Sure, it’s definitely sexier and machined a bit better than the Sunex, but the Sunex sockets saved me at least once when the Wera failed me, so I really couldn’t justify keeping the (fairly expensive) Wera kit around.</p>
<p>Sure, I wish the Sunex kit had a better case, and could fit in my pocket, if needed…</p>
<p>So, enter what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/">the r/HarborFreight subreddit</a> calls the “Meme Tool”: the <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/locking-flex-head-ratchet-and-bit-set-35-piece-58074.html">ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet and Bit Set, 35-Piece</a>. She’s a beauty. I love that the ratchet is a *locking* flex head. The extension can be used in multiple configurations to get at just about any fastener. And, again, basically every bit I’ve ever needed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyvhq65iJ8s?feature=oembed" title="ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet And Bit Set, 35 Pc by Harbor Freight tools! NTDT!" width="750"></iframe></div></figure>What’s more, it’s got a no-hassle lifetime warranty, so if I happen to break something, I can go to the nearest Harbor Freight and get a new kit!
<p>I carry the Harbor Freight “Meme Tool” kit around with me most places, in addition to the Harbor Freight Leatherman Wave knockoff, the <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/20-in-1-multi-tool-59617.html">GORDON 20-in-1 Multi-Tool</a>.</p>
<p>The only thing the Harbor Freight meme tool is missing is *sockets*! This is the one thing the Sunex kit wins-out on. I wish there were a way to combine the nice case, better ratchet, and useful extension from the HF Icon kit with he sockets of the Sunex kit.</p>
<p>Turns out, I’m not the only one who feels this way! Someone over at r/HarborFreight has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/comments/1dhj1o8/i_present_to_you_hooligans_v2_the_icant/">designed a print-it-yourself case that can hold the original items from the Icon set plus sockets (they call it the ICAN’T, lol).</a></p>
<p>The only reason I haven’t bought <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/jaahwnsstuff/?etsrc=sdt">one of those modified ICAN’T cases from the absolute genius on Etsy</a> is that, last year at the SEMA 2023 conference, Harbor Freight unveiled a new “Meme Tool + Sockets” and said that it would come out sometime in 2024!</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pr4fG5NzCo?start=585&feature=oembed" title="Unveiling all the NEW Harbor Freight Tools At SEMA 2023!" width="750"></iframe></div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Start at 9:45 to see the Meme Tool w/Sockets</figcaption></figure>So, here we are. It’s mid-September and I’m checking r/HarborFreight and the Harbor Freight website daily to see if the new Meme Tool w/Sockets is out yet.
<p>And, while I wait for Harbor Freight to come through, I can’t help but notice other ratchet, bit, and socket combinations out there (like <a href="https://amzn.to/4d8MDWV">this one from P.I.T.</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/4epaaUC">this one from Bosch</a>)!</p>
<p>Yes, I probably have a problem. But does anyone else out there have the same problem? Have you found a mini toolkit that you absolutely love? What about other EDC tools? Please let me know in the comments below!</p>

      <title>You Can&#39;t Follow Jesus and Hate Immigrants</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/you-cant-follow-jesus-and-hate-immigrants/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 16:19:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/you-cant-follow-jesus-and-hate-immigrants/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.</p>
<p>Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!</p>
<p>But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.</p>
<p>What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?</p>
<p>What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?</p>
<p>If you think that a given immigration policy or system is a mess and that X, Y, or Z should be done about it, what are your motivations? Are you concerned about the welfare of the immigrants themselves, many of whom are quite poor and powerless? Or are you acting out of fear and self-interest?</p>
<p>Some may object, saying that while Christians are called to love immigrants, we still need to protect our borders and uphold laws. And it’s true that immigration policy is complex, and nations have a responsibility to maintain order and security.</p>
<p>However, the question here isn’t about the specifics of policy but about the posture of our hearts. As followers of Jesus, our first responsibility is to love others—including immigrants—as those made in God’s image. Upholding laws and protecting our country should never justify fear, hatred, or dehumanization.</p>
<p>Others may argue that showing hospitality to immigrants and refugees could lead to an unsustainable burden on our resources or change our cultural identity. While practical concerns about resources are valid, Scripture repeatedly calls us to care for the vulnerable, trusting that God will provide.</p>
<p>Moreover, the kingdom of God is not confined by national or cultural boundaries! As citizens of this kingdom, our identity should first and foremost be shaped by our faith, not by our nationality.</p>
<p>The Bible actually has quite a bit to say about immigrants, sojourners, and refugees. In fact, you can even read the entire storyline of Scripture through these lenses. Here’s the tiniest of tastes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God.<br>
(Leviticus 19:33–34, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow.<br>
(Deuteronomy 27:19, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was a stranger and you invited me in…<br>
(Matthew 25:35, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.<br>
(Hebrews 13:14, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.<br>
(Hebrews 13:2, NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As M. Daniel Carroll Rodas explains in an article on “Aliens, Immigration, and Refugees”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the Old and New Testaments offer rich teachings on migration, emphasizing that refugees and immigrants are made in the image of God.</li>
<li>Many biblical figures, like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus himself, were displaced persons.</li>
<li>Old Testament laws protected the vulnerable, including immigrants.</li>
<li>Jesus’s teachings further challenge believers to see the outsider as someone who can lead them to a deeper faith.</li>
<li>The New Testament epistles also call the church to care for those on the margins, reminding Christians that they, too, are “strangers” in the world.</li>
<li>Biblical teachings on migration should shape how Christians act toward immigrants today, promoting “human flourishing and the common good” through both personal behavior and societal involvement</li>
</ul>
<p>(Source: M. Daniel Carroll R., “Aliens, Immigration, and Refugees,” <em>Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</em>, Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2011, 58).</p>
<p>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.</p>
<p>Next time you’re reading the Bible, keep an eye out for terms like “alien,” “stranger,” “resident alien,” “foreigner,” and “sojourner.”</p>
<p>The next time you think or speak about immigrants, ask yourself: Do your words reflect the heart of Jesus or the harsh rhetoric of political discourse?</p>
<p>Consider how the kingdom of God cuts right across ethnic and national boundaries, reshaping our loyalties to all nations, tribes, etc.</p>
<p>As followers of Jesus, we are called to reflect His love and compassion in every area of our lives, including how we treat immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p>Take time to examine your heart and attitudes, and ask how you can embody Christ’s radical hospitality.</p>
<p>Engage with Scripture, seek out opportunities to welcome the stranger, and challenge rhetoric that dehumanizes or divides.</p>
<p>Let’s commit to being voices of love, grace, and justice in a world that so desperately needs them.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election. Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>As I’ve thought more about these topics, my reading list has grown, and I wanted to share it with you. It’s a mix of books I’ve read and some that are still on my to-read list.

<h3 id="abortion-specific-reads">Abortion-Specific Reads</h3>
<p>When it comes to abortion, I think it’s a tragedy that needs to be reduced, ideally through a consistent pro-life ethic. However, I’m also curious about progressive theological arguments for a pro-choice stance. Here are a few books I’m reading to explore those ideas:</p>

</ul>

<p>In addition to Christian political theology, I’ve also been diving into U.S. and world history, trying to get a better sense of where we’ve been and how it informs the present.</p>

      <title>Home Improvement Roadmap and Roadblocks</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/home-improvement-roadmap-and-roadblocks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 16:26:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/home-improvement-roadmap-and-roadblocks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bought our first house in late 2023 and, since moving-in in January 2024, I’ve been chipping away at home improvement projects. Since I’m a software engineer and spend my day in front of a screen, I enjoy working with tools as a change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some upcoming projects will clearly outstrip my capabilities and I plan to hire professionals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Replace roof and gutters&lt;br&gt;
– Replace furnace and central air conditioning&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We bought our first house in late 2023 and, since moving-in in January 2024, I’ve been chipping away at home improvement projects. Since I’m a software engineer and spend my day in front of a screen, I enjoy working with tools as a change of pace.</p>
<p>Now, some upcoming projects will clearly outstrip my capabilities and I plan to hire professionals:</p>
<p>– Replace roof and gutters<br>
– Replace furnace and central air conditioning</p>
<p>Other projects are probably beyond my capabilities, and I will most likely hire professionals. But, I still spend a fair bit of time thinking about doing them myself:</p>
<p>– Get/build a shed<br>
– Trim and/or take down tall oak trees (they’re quite tall and we’re in a residential neighborhood…if we lived out in the country, I’d totally try to do this myself!)<br>
– Install a handrail with columns on basement stairway (to prevent falling-off the stairs into the basement)</p>
<p>Other things I plan to do myself:</p>
<p>– Install water-powered backup sump pump (in progress!)<br>
– Clean gutters (which have really old and difficult-to-remove sheet metal “leaf guards” on them)<br>
– Fix oddly-wired light switches in bedrooms<br>
– Power-wash house, driveway, and sidewalk<br>
– Re-caulk exterior of house (ugh, really not looking forward to this…lots of scraping old caulk required!)<br>
– Install a new duct and register in main, finished basement room<br>
– Install new PVC drain pipes for kitchen sink and garbage disposal<br>
– Build my own garage workbench</p>
<p>I’ve got a bunch of hand and power tools already, but I’m running into a roadblock when it comes to obtaining and moving larger objects: I don’t have a truck!</p>
<p>This is currently preventing me from doing things like:</p>
<p>– Getting plywood and 2x4s for my workbench<br>
– Getting an extension ladder for cleaning out my gutters, trimming tree branches, etc.<br>
– Purchasing a used refrigerator for our garage<br>
– Purchasing a used table saw for our garage</p>
<p>Instead, we’ve got a 2007 Honda Civic sedan and a 2019 Kia Sedona minivan. Neither of which have roof bars or a towing hookup.</p>
<p>I’m debating installing a roof rack on one or both cars. I’m also considering purchasing a towing hookup for the minivan and getting a trailer from Harbor Freight.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’m on the lookout for a good deal on a used truck!</p>
<p>Given the truck roadblock, I’m also trying to figure out the best order to tackle these projects in.</p>
<p>I think it makes sense to start with getting a shed, since that would clear out more space in my garage for a work bench.</p>
<p>After that, though, I’m not sure. But “figure out a way to be able to transport large things” is definitely floating around at the top of the mental list.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how best to tackle some of these home improvement projects? Am I making too big of a deal about not having a truck, and should I just suck it up and either rent one or buy one? Let me know!</p>

      <title>Finding a Hat for My Big, Bald Head</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/finding-a-hat-for-my-big-bald-head/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 12:48:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/finding-a-hat-for-my-big-bald-head/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on a lifelong journey to find hats that will fit my big ol’ head. Now that I’m bald, and the summer months are approaching, I figured it would be good to find one or two more hats to add to my rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve narrowed this round down to trying the following hats, in case you’re interested (Amazon affiliate links below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOO SMALL FOR ME&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3xVZv3O&#34;&gt;Carhartt Men’s Rugged Professional Series Canvas Mesh-Back Cap&lt;/a&gt; (Shadow, One Size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3Wi6GgS&#34;&gt;Carhartt Men’s 100289 Odessa Ball Cap&lt;/a&gt; (Carhartt Brown, One Size)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m a sucker for Carhartt and Carhartt brown!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This hat is comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like that it looks different than my other hats, which tend to be black, gray, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3UzLvWa&#34;&gt;Ankor Ultra Performance Water-Resistant UPF 50 Baseball Hat&lt;/a&gt; (Charcoal Gray, One Size)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charcoal gray is my favorite color (not sure what that says about me…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really like the look and fit of this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3xLtY4j&#34;&gt;Flexfit Men’s Delta Seamless Cap&lt;/a&gt; (Dark Grey, XX-Large)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love the look and color of this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very comfortable!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder if it’s a tad *too* big for my head, though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/4aI6v2F&#34;&gt;Flexfit Mens Cool &amp;amp; Dry Sport&lt;/a&gt; (Grey, X-Large-XX-Large)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This hat gets here in the mail today! I’m excited to try it out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

<h3 id="for-sleep">For Sleep</h3>
<p>O heavenly Father, you give your children sleep for the refreshing of soul and body: Grant me this gift, I pray; keep me in that perfect peace which you have promised to those whose minds are fixed on you; and give me such a sense of your presence, that in the hours of silence I may enjoy the blessed assurance of your love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<h3 id="in-the-morning">In the Morning</h3>
<p>This is another day, O Lord. I know not what it will bring forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I am to stand up, help me to stand bravely.

Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit of Jesus. <em>Amen.</em></p>

      <title>Death in His Grave</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Holy Week and Easter coming up, I’ve been thinking about music and artwork that I’ve found particularly poignant when reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’ve seen many icons of the resurrection (“anastasis,” in Greek) like the one below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think I fully appreciated the image until I realized it was Adam and Eve that Christ is helping up out of their graves. He’s trampled down the doors/gates of Hell and is taking an elderly Adam and an elderly Eve by the hand. Rescuing them from the realm of Death, in order to bring them back to eternal life with God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Second, I’ve long appreciated “Death in His Grave” by John Mark McMillan as a reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.</p>

<p>By John Mark McMillan</p>
<p>Though the Earth Cried out for blood<br>
Satisfied her hunger was<br>
Her billows calmed on raging seas<br>
For the souls on men she craved</p>
<p>Sun and moon from balcony<br>
Turned their head in disbelief<br>
Their precious Love would taste the sting<br>
Disfigured and disdained</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke with keys<br>
Of Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>So three days in darkness slept<br>
The Morning Sun of righteousness<br>
But rose to shame the throes of death<br>
And over turn his rule</p>
<p>Now daughters and the sons of men<br>
Would pay not their dues again<br>
The debt of blood they owed was rent<br>
When the day rolled a new</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke holding keys<br>
To Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke with keys<br>
Of Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>He has cheated<br>
Hell and seated<br>
Us above the fall<br>
In desperate places<br>
He paid our wages<br>
One time once and for all</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve often enjoyed lifting weights, but I’ve never enjoyed going to the gym. So, I’ve long wanted a nice home gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we lived in a basement apartment, space was very limited, but I was able to fit a &lt;a href=&#34;https://valorfitness.com/products/bd-9-independent-power-squat-stands&#34;&gt;Valor Fitness BD-9 squat rack/stands&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3Tawich&#34;&gt;Amazon Basics flat bench&lt;/a&gt; in, along with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p/fitness-gear-300-lbolympic-weight-set-16fgeu300lbstwth7brb/16fgeu300lbstwth7brb&#34;&gt;300-lb Olympic barbell and weight set&lt;/a&gt; from Dicks Sporting Goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you’re similarly pressed for space, I highly recommend those items above!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve often enjoyed lifting weights, but I’ve never enjoyed going to the gym. So, I’ve long wanted a nice home gym.</p>
<p>When we lived in a basement apartment, space was very limited, but I was able to fit a <a href="https://valorfitness.com/products/bd-9-independent-power-squat-stands">Valor Fitness BD-9 squat rack/stands</a> and an <a href="https://amzn.to/3Tawich">Amazon Basics flat bench</a> in, along with a <a href="https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p/fitness-gear-300-lbolympic-weight-set-16fgeu300lbstwth7brb/16fgeu300lbstwth7brb">300-lb Olympic barbell and weight set</a> from Dicks Sporting Goods.</p>
<p>(If you’re similarly pressed for space, I highly recommend those items above!)</p>
<p>We took all this stuff with us when we moved to renting a 100-year old house in Pittsburgh. There was enough space in the basement, but we referred to it as the “murder basement” because it way so creepy, damp, moldy, and dark down there.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, when we’ve finally got a garage!</p>
<p>My wife’s an avid runner, so we splurged for a nice <a href="https://www.soletreadmills.com/products/sole-f85">Sole F-85 treadmill</a>.</p>
<p>And I pulled the trigger on a power rack: <a href="https://repfitness.com/products/pr-1100-power-rack">Rep Fitness’s PR-1100</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Next on my list, as a part of <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/back-in-the-saddle/">getting back into the saddle</a>, as it were, is USING this equipment more regularly, as a part of getting back into shape.</p>
<p>Future upgrades to the home gym include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting together a deadlifting platform/surface (probably with these <a href="https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/4-ft-x-6-ft-x-3-4-in-thick-rubber-stall-mat">horse stall mats from Tractor Supply Co.</a>)</li>
<li>Getting a nicer barbell (I’ve got my eyes on <a href="https://repfitness.com/products/colorado-bar-20kg">Rep Fitness’s Colorado bar</a>)</li>

      <title>The Problem of Ecclesiastical Evil</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-problem-of-ecclesiastical-evil/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 12:26:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-problem-of-ecclesiastical-evil/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard of “the problem of evil” (if not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil&#34;&gt;here’s an overview&lt;/a&gt;). But there’s a specific version/aspect of it that I find even more devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God is omnipotent (all-powerful), ommniscient (all-knowing(, and omnibenevolent (completely good)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Church is God’s main plan for the redemption of humanity and the cosmos (consider the “body of Christ” paradigm in the New Testament)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the gospel of Jesus Christ has had ~2K years to percolate in and through the Church…&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard of “the problem of evil” (if not, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil">here’s an overview</a>). But there’s a specific version/aspect of it that I find even more devastating.</p>
<p>If God is omnipotent (all-powerful), ommniscient (all-knowing(, and omnibenevolent (completely good)…</p>
<p>If the Church is God’s main plan for the redemption of humanity and the cosmos (consider the “body of Christ” paradigm in the New Testament)…</p>
<p>If the gospel of Jesus Christ has had ~2K years to percolate in and through the Church…</p>
<p>Whence so much evil, corruption, abuse, etc. in the Church?</p>
<p>Why hasn’t the Church, on the whole, produced better people (myself included)?</p>
<p>Sure, it’s <em>easy</em> to appeal to the Church as a “corpus permixtum” (mixed body) and say that it’s all just tares mixed in with the wheat (see Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43).</p>
<p>But doing so often feels like a “No True Scotsman” fallacy to me. <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsman">Here’s what that means</a>.</p>
<p>(Also, sidebar: Notice how the “field” is the “world” in Matthew 13:38. Not the “kingdom” or the “church.” So, is the Church a mixed body? Or is the world a mixed body?)</p>
<p>Every time I read <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2802.htm"><em>On the Incarnation</em> by Athanasius</a>, I’m struck by how much he is willing to stake the truth of the gospel on the actual observed behavior of Christians.</p>
<p>Here are some examples below, but go and read the entire “Answer to the Greeks” / “Refutation of the Gentiles” section (paragraphs 41–55). Note how often Athanasius argues for the truth of Christ by appealing to the changed behaviors of human beings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When did human beings begin to abandon the worship of idols, except since the true God Word of God came among human beings?</p>
<p>Or when have the oracles amongst the Greeks and everywhere ceased and become empty, except since the Savior revealed himself upon earth?</p>
<p>Or when did those who are called gods and heroes by the poets begin to be condemned as merely mortal humans, except since the Lord erected the trophy over death and preserved incorruptible the body which he took, raising it from the dead?</p>
<p>Or when were the deceit and madness of the demons despised, except when the Power of God, the Word, the Master of all, even of these, condescended, because of the weakness of humans, to appear on earth? When did the craft and teachings of magic begin to be trampled underfoot, except when the divine manifestation of the Word took place among human beings?</p>
<p>And when, in short, did the wisdom of the Greeks become foolish (cf. 1 Cor 1:18–24) except when the true Wisdom of God revealed itself upon earth?</p>
<p>For formerly the whole inhabited world and every place were led astray by the worship of idols, and human beings regarded nothing else but idols as gods.</p>
<p>Now, however, throughout the whole inhabited world, human beings are deserting the superstition of idols, taking refuge in Christ, and worshipping him as God, and through him they know the Father, of whom they had been ignorant.</p>
<p><cite>Athanasius, On the Incarnation, §46</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now these things said by us are not merely words, but have the witness of their truth from experience itself. Let him who wishes come up and behold the proof of virtue in the virgins of Christ and in the youth who live a pure life in chastity, and the belief in immortality in so great a company of martyrs.</p>
<p><cite>Athanasius, On the Incarnation, §48</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And who thus delivered human beings from the natural passions, so that adulterers are chaste, murderers no longer take up the sword, and those overcome by cowardice are courageous? Or, in short, what persuaded human beings from the barbarians and the Gentile regions to lay aside their madness, and to mind peace, except the faith of Christ and that sign of the cross?</p>
<p><cite>Athanasius, On the Incarnation, §50</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who then among human beings, after death or even while alive, taught about virginity and did not think that this virtue was impossible among human beings? But our Savior and king of all, Christ, so prevailed in the teaching of this that even children not yet arrived at the lawful age profess the virginity that is above the law.</p>
<p><cite>Athanasius, On the Incarnation, §51</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To speak concisely, behold how the teaching of the Savior increases everywhere, while all idolatry and everything opposed to the faith of Christ daily diminish and weaken and fall.</p>
<p><cite>Athanasius, On the Incarnation, §55</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t make a similar argument in good faith today.</p>
<p>Instead, I believe the good news about Jesus <strong>in spite of</strong> how his Church has, on the whole, behaved.</p>
<p>Which, even though I know all of the theological pressure-release valves one can use here, bugs me quite a bit.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I’m not alone in this, but the past few years have been pretty rough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve gained at least 50 pounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a fun part-time gig as a managing editor come to an end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve come to terms with some &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/its-time-to-get-some-help/&#34;&gt;long-term depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a job offer ripped out from under me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/its-official-im-hitting-pause-on-my-ph-d-for-a-year/&#34;&gt;hit pause&lt;/a&gt; on and eventually dropped out of my Ph.D. program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/&#34;&gt;resigned from ordained ministry in the ACNA&lt;/a&gt;, my previous denomination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I’m not alone in this, but the past few years have been pretty rough for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve gained at least 50 pounds.</li>
<li>I had a fun part-time gig as a managing editor come to an end.</li>
<li>I’ve come to terms with some <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/its-time-to-get-some-help/">long-term depression and anxiety</a>.</li>

<p>Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.</p>
<p>But, overall, I definitely feel less focused and energized than I used to.</p>
<p>Do I have a sure solution or a grand commitment to make? No.</p>
<p>But I decided that I can at least start blogging about turning things around. I can write about my experiences as I try to get back into the personal development saddle.</p>
<p>As a first step, I need to get a better grip of everything I’ve got “in flight” at the moment. I’ve got far too many things bouncing around in my head, and I need to get them down on paper and/or a digital system to manage them.</p>
<p>So I’ve dusted-off my copy of <a href="https://amzn.to/3wJO5iZ"><em>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</em> by David Allen</a>. And I’ve started a “brain dump” in my main notebook (a Bullet Journal-like combination of journaling, to-dos, and notes).</p>
<p>Any other crestfallen personal development/productivity junkies out there? Let me know how it’s going!</p>

      <title>25 Possibly Unpopular Opinions about Church</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/25-possibly-unpopular-opinions-about-church/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:42:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/25-possibly-unpopular-opinions-about-church/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following are some of my opinions, held with varying levels of intensity, about church/churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: These are geared toward Christian churches in the USA. Some would obviously also apply to churches elsewhere. But I haven’t nuanced this entire list for all global church contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many churches in the USA are too “busy.” They are trying to do too many different things and should instead refocus on the church’s proper priorities (Word and Sacraments).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following are some of my opinions, held with varying levels of intensity, about church/churches.</p>
<p>Note: These are geared toward Christian churches in the USA. Some would obviously also apply to churches elsewhere. But I haven’t nuanced this entire list for all global church contexts.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many churches in the USA are too “busy.” They are trying to do too many different things and should instead refocus on the church’s proper priorities (Word and Sacraments).</p>
<p>Churches should focus on preaching and teaching the Word of God, administering the Sacraments (Holy Communion and Baptism), and serving the welfare of their local communities.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you walk into a church sanctuary (or whatever else you want to call the place where the worship service takes place), the setting should (as much as possible) clearly indicate the importance of the Word of God and the Sacraments.</p>
<p>So, if possible, have a cross, pulpit, altar/table (for Holy Communion), etc. front-and-center.</p>
<p>Your country’s flag should not be in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Concerts and TED talks are both great. But a Christian worship service is not a concert with a TED talk thrown in.</p>
<p>Don’t try to mimic a concert. Don’t put the musicians front-and-center, if possible.</p>
<p>Use a mixture of sacred music (old and new) that is fitting for a Christian worship service. We don’t need covers of Coldplay, Taylor Swift, U2, etc. in a worship service.</p>
<p>The quality of the musicians and vocalists should be as good as possible, given the musical gifts that God has provided your congregation with. Doesn’t have to be world-class. Just don’t be distracting. Simple and good is better than showy or off-key.</p>
<p>Don’t have the same volume levels as a concert. The congregation should be able to hear itself sing (and think).</p>
<hr>
<p><em>At least</em> one passage of Scripture should be clearly read aloud during each worship service. Ideally more than one!</p>
<p>A sermon is for the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It’s not a standup comedy act, a motivational speech, TED talk, etc.</p>
<p>A sermon doesn’t need to be longer than 30 minutes.</p>
<hr>
<p>“We don’t do Holy Communion that often because we want it to be special” is a bad argument.</p>
<p>Churches should provide Holy Communion as often/regularly as logistically possible. Communion should be treated and taken with reverence, but it is not made special by our attitudes, feelings, etc. It is a work of God, by which He makes himself present to His people.</p>
<p>At minimum, the “Words of Institution” should be a part of every single Communion liturgy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. (1 Cor. 11:23-25)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Holy Communion should be offered to all baptized followers of Jesus Christ. It should not be restricted to your denomination, congregation, branch of the church, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Positions (and titles) of pastoral leadership should be open to both men and women. As they are gifted, called, and trained to do so, women should be able to preach, teach, pastor, etc.–using the full breadth of their spiritual gifts.</p>
<hr>
<p>Each church should have clear policies around the prevention of and response to various forms of abuse. A child safety policy, abuse/harassment policy, etc. These policies should be regularly reviewed and enforced.</p>
<p>Accusations of abuse should be taken seriously, treated confidentially, and reported to the local authorities. Clergy should act as mandatory reporters, even if they are not required to do so by local law.</p>
<p>Church leaders who are caught up in abuse, scandal, etc. should be removed (or remove themselves) from office. Sure, there’s forgiveness for everyone at the Cross, but they need to find another line of work. “Abusive pastor” should be an oxymoron. No matter how charismatic or gifted they are, the church doesn’t “need” any one person to be in a position of power and authority, if they have shown they cannot be trusted with power and authority.</p>
<hr>
<p>Poor people should feel welcomed, loved, and respected at your church.</p>
<p>People from all countries, cultures, etc. should feel welcomed, loved, and respected at your church, regardless of their immigration status..</p>
<p>LGBTQ people should feel welcomed, loved, and respected at your church.</p>
<hr>
<p>If the church speaks out in the public square, it should be on behalf of “others,” instead of out of self-interest.</p>
<p>Less: “We’re being persecuted! We demand and defend our rights!”</p>
<p>More: “The poor and powerless are being persecuted! We demand and defend their rights, even if it costs us to do so!”</p>
<hr>
<p>To be continued…possibly.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m Resigning from Ordained Ministry in the Anglican Church in North America</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 19:50:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a considerable period of discernment, coupled with my growing disaffection with the Anglican Church in North America, I sense God calling me to step away from ordained ministry in the ACNA and instead to focus on my family and my career as a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also coincides with plans to move closer to family in NW Ohio (where there is not much of an ACNA presence to speak of) and to then pursue church involvement outside of the ACNA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a considerable period of discernment, coupled with my growing disaffection with the Anglican Church in North America, I sense God calling me to step away from ordained ministry in the ACNA and instead to focus on my family and my career as a software engineer.</p>
<p>This also coincides with plans to move closer to family in NW Ohio (where there is not much of an ACNA presence to speak of) and to then pursue church involvement outside of the ACNA.</p>
<p>Therefore, in accordance with Title III, Canon 6, Section 4 of the ACNA Canons (“Concerning Voluntary Resignation from the Ordained Ministry of this Church”), I have tendered my voluntary resignation from the ordained ministry of the Anglican Church in North America, effective on 2023-11-01.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">
  <img src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Joshua-Steele-ACNA-Resignation_2023-11-07.jpg" alt="A letter from Todd Hunter, Bishop Ordinary of The Diocese of Churches for the Sake of Others, approving Joshua Steele's request to resign from ministerial duties in the ACNA.">
  <figcaption>A letter from Todd Hunter, Bishop Ordinary of The Diocese of Churches for the Sake of Others, approving Joshua Steele's request to resign from ministerial duties in the ACNA.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As of 2023-11-07, my bishop and diocese have confirmed that I am a Presbyter in good standing, not under discipline as defined in Title IV of the ACNA Canons, and that my resignation is not occasioned by misconduct or irregularity, but is voluntary and for causes which do not affect my moral character.</p>
<p>My resignation has therefore been accepted. This means that I am released from the obligations of the Ministerial office. I relinquish the right to exercise the gifts and spiritual authority as a Minister of God’s Word and Sacraments in the Anglican Church in North America.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’d like to clarify that the ACNA Canons differentiate between (A) resigning from the ordained ministry of the ACNA and (B) renouncing one’s Holy Orders as such.</p>
<p>While I currently have no plans to pursue ordained ministry within another Christian denomination or jurisdiction, I am solely (A) resigning from the ordained ministry in the ACNA, not (B) renouncing my Holy Orders. This distinction leaves the door ajar for potential ordained ministry elsewhere, should the Lord call me back to such in the future.</p>

      <title>Life Lessons: 32 Things I&#39;ve Learned So Far</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/life-lessons/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2023 12:45:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/life-lessons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are 32 things I’ve learned from life, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not your thoughts. There is a “you” behind and above your inner voice/monologue/dialogue. Pay attention to what you pay attention to. Think about what you think about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We always only have the present moment. Focusing too much on the future leads to anxiety. Focusing too much on the past leads to depression. Wherever you are, be fully there, now! (Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/400hFeH&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt; by Eckhart Tolle&lt;/a&gt; [affiliate link here and throughout] for more on this.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s OK not to be OK. Feeling anxious, depressed, angry, etc. is fine. However, avoid the trap of feeling anxious about how anxious you feel, feeling depressed about how depressed you feel, etc. (Learned this from &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/404talb&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Happiness Trap&lt;/em&gt; by Russ Harris&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you never make mistakes, you’re not learning/growing as well as you could be. Perfectionism is a deadly prison. Break free with “good enough” and “always learning.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are stronger than you think you are. You are weaker than you think you are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask more questions. Ask better questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is not a thing among things. There is an “infinite qualitative difference” between God and everything that is not God, everything that exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jesus of Nazareth is the living Lord of all. ___ is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of overconfidence in what the Bible (or any other sacred text, for that matter) “clearly”does or does not say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is devoted to the poor and powerless. Those who speak and act on God’s behalf should speak and act &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the poor and powerless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do better with people, ask them questions about themselves. (Read the classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3QlSsrR&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/em&gt; by Dale Carnegie&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t out-exercise your appetite forever. &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/4018XfY&#34;&gt;Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get enough sleep. You probably don’t get enough sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift heavy things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go outside. Take a walk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a Roth IRA. Invest consistently in low-cost mutual funds or lifecycle funds as soon as you can. (Learned this from &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/48Uc65D&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Will Teach You to Be Rich&lt;/em&gt; by Ramit Sethi&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading is a superpower. You can learn from as many other lives and lifetimes as you want. &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/46YrOdW&#34;&gt;Learn how to read&lt;/a&gt;. Then &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/46Dgm7J&#34;&gt;learn how to learn.&lt;/a&gt; Then, learn whatever you want!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always read with a pen or pencil in your hand. If you really want to learn from a book, buy a physical copy and annotate the heck out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You always have to earn and keep your audience’s attention. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “Why should they care? What’s in it for them?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans are incredibly good at misunderstanding each other. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “How might I be misunderstood? How might I be misunderstanding others?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that you and your loved ones are all going to die. What do you want to be known for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eulogize people BEFORE they die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone should go to therapy for at least a few months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.” Feeling nervous/stressed/angry/etc.? SLOW DOWN, especially if you’re in front of other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Courage is a choice, not a feeling. No matter how nervous you are, you can always ACT courageously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is trying to figure it out as they go along. Do you often feel like an imposter? Join the club!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act like you’ve been here before. Act like you’ve done this before. Act calm, comfortable, and confident, if for no other reason than to help the people around you feel calm, comfortable, and confident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership is service. Leadership is the willingness to make a decision for the good of the group even when it’s awkward or uncomfortable to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on what you can control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journal. What do you really want? What are you afraid of? What’s the most important thing you need to get done today? Get a notebook and write it down!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many domains, 80% of the outcomes/effects come from 20% of the inputs/causes. Find the “vital few” things that have outsized impacts, both positive and negative, on your life. Double-down on what’s helping you. Get rid of what’s hurting you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use smoked paprika. You’re welcome.&lt;/li&gt;

<p>Think AI is only for tech gurus and coding aficionados? Think again. AI is breaking down the ivory tower, becoming an invaluable asset for everyone from marketers and writers to busy parents.

<h2 id="ai-tool-recommendations-chatgpt-notion-and-dall-e-2">AI Tool Recommendations: ChatGPT, Notion, and DALL-E 2</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the AI elephant in the room: ChatGPT! It’s the AI tool I use most often and it’s probably the best place to start for AI beginners.</p>
<p>So, if you haven’t already done so, head over to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">https://chat.openai.com/</a> to start using ChatGPT for yourself. It’s as easy as chatting or texting with a friend.</p>
<p>Other AI tools that are good places to start for beginners include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Bing’s Chat (search and chat): <a href="https://www.bing.com/">https://www.bing.com/</a></li>
<li>Notion (all-in-one notes and productivity): <a href="https://www.notion.so/product">https://www.notion.so/product</a></li>

<h2 id="how-to-use-ai-mastering-the-subtleties-of-prompt-engineering">How to Use AI: Mastering the Subtleties of “Prompt Engineering”</h2>
<p>You’ve heard the phrase “It’s not what you say; it’s how you say it,” right? In the world of AI, it’s both what you say and how you say it that count. This concept crystallizes into what we call “Prompt Engineering”—the art and science of effectively instructing AI to get the response you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt Engineering</strong> is crucial because even sophisticated models like ChatGPT-4 rely on the context and clarity provided by your prompt. A poorly-structured or ambiguous prompt often results in equally confusing or lackluster responses. Therefore, learning to master your prompts can be the difference between a frustrating experience and one that feels like you’re interacting with a truly helpful digital assistant.</p>

<li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> If you’re looking for a detailed answer, make sure your prompt outlines this expectation. For example, instead of asking, “Tell me about coffee,” you could say, “Explain the difference between Arabica and Robusta coffee beans in terms of flavor and caffeine content.”</li>
<li><strong>Set the Format:</strong> If you’re after information in a particular structure, guide the AI by stating that upfront. For example, “List the steps to create a simple Python program to say ‘Hello, World!&rsquo;”</li>
<li><strong>Ask for Revisions:</strong> If the AI’s first attempt doesn’t quite hit the mark, use that output as a stepping stone. You can say, “That’s a good start, but can you elaborate on X?” or “That’s close, but can you rephrase that in simpler terms?”</li>
<li><strong>Be Interactive:</strong> Don’t be afraid to have a back-and-forth with the AI. These tools are designed for interactivity. Feel free to ask follow-up questions or seek clarifications just as you would in a conversation with a human.</li>
</ol>
<p>By understanding and applying these principles of prompt engineering, you’ll be able to maximize the capabilities of AI tools, making them far more valuable in your personal and professional life. It’s like learning to speak a new digital dialect—one that can unlock doors you didn’t even know existed.</p>
<h2 id="the-most-important-ai-tool-tip-iterate-iterate-iterate">The MOST Important AI Tool Tip: Iterate, Iterate, Iterate!</h2>
<p>I’m repeating myself and making this its own section because it’s so important. One of the very best things about these new generative AI tools is that you can iterate with them.</p>
<p>That is, you can go back-and-forth with the AI tool, asking for improvements, revisions, clarifications, etc.!</p>
<p>At first, this might not seem like a big deal, but it really is the KEY for getting AI to produce good, helpful content for you.</p>
<p>For example: Ask ChatGPT to write an email to your boss asking for a raise. If you don’t like what it gives you back, then use this opportunity to get specific about what you want. Too formal? Not formal enough? Don’t just ask for more money, but also better hours? List reasons X, Y, and Z why you deserve the raise?</p>
<p>Hell, just the back-and-forth process alone is beneficial, because it forces you to get clear and get specific!</p>
<p>Bottom line: Don’t give up on an AI tool if its first response doesn’t blow you away. Instead, leverage the tool’s capabilities, and take the opportunity to clarify your desires and thoughts, by ITERATING. Go back-and-forth with these tools and you’ll be impressed with where they can take you!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Online scams can touch anyone’s life. They don’t discriminate based on how tech-savvy you are or how often you use the internet. We’ve all heard stories—maybe from a friend, a family member, or even in the news—of someone getting tricked online, often with distressing consequences. It serves as a stark reminder of the darker side of our digital world.</p>
<p>This is why it’s crucial for every one of us to understand online scams—how they operate, how to identify them, and most importantly, how to avoid becoming a victim.</p>
<p>In this guide, I’ll demystify the most common types of online scams and equip you with practical knowledge to stay safe. Regardless of whether you’re a digital native or just someone who occasionally checks emails or shops online, this guide will offer valuable insights to help protect you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>Let’s begin this important journey to digital safety.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-online-scams">Understanding Online Scams</h2>
<p>In the broadest sense, an online scam is a fraudulent scheme performed by a dishonest individual, group, or company in an attempt to obtain money or something else of value from unsuspecting internet users. They can happen virtually anywhere online, from your email inbox to social media platforms, online marketplaces, and even dating sites.</p>
<p>Here are a few common types of online scams that you might encounter:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Phishing Scams:</strong> Perhaps the most common type of online scam, phishing occurs when a scammer attempts to trick you into giving out your personal information. They might send you an email that appears to be from a legitimate company asking you to login to your account, and when you do, they capture your username and password.</li>
<li><strong>Lottery Scams:</strong> These scams operate by telling you that you’ve won a huge amount of money in a lottery or sweepstakes that you never even entered. To receive your “winnings,” however, you’ll be asked to pay a fee or provide your banking information.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Support Scams:</strong> Scammers posing as tech support personnel from a well-known company claim to have detected issues with your computer. They’ll attempt to gain remote access to your machine, potentially stealing data or installing harmful software.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples (for more examples and advice, <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/top-scams-how-to-avoid-becoming-a-victim">checkout this piece from Kaspersky</a>). Scams can come in many forms, and scammers are always evolving their tactics. However, understanding these common types of scams is the first step toward protecting yourself.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-identify-online-scams">How to Identify Online Scams</h2>
<p>While online scams can take various forms and evolve over time, there are certain red flags you can look out for to help you identify potential scams:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unsolicited Contact:</strong> Be wary if you receive unexpected emails, messages, or calls from people or organizations you don’t know, especially if they’re asking for personal or financial information.</li>
<li><strong>Too Good To Be True:</strong> If an offer seems too good to be true—like a huge lottery win from a contest you never entered—it probably is. Scammers often lure their victims with promises of large financial gains.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure Tactics:</strong> Many scammers try to create a sense of urgency to pressure you into making quick decisions without giving you time to think or verify the information.</li>
<li><strong>Requests for Sensitive Information:</strong> Legitimate companies will rarely, if ever, ask for your personal or financial information through email or text message.</li>
<li><strong>Grammar and Spelling Mistakes:</strong> While not always the case, many scam messages contain poor grammar and spelling. This can be a telltale sign of a scam, as legitimate companies typically proofread their communications carefully.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s an example: Imagine you receive an email that looks like it’s from your bank. The email states there’s been suspicious activity on your account and you need to confirm your details immediately or your account will be closed.</p>
<p>But there’s something off about the email—the bank’s logo looks a bit blurry, there are a couple of typos, and they’ve addressed you as ‘Valued Customer’ instead of your name. All of these signs point to a potential phishing scam.</p>
<p>By recognizing these signs, you can better protect yourself from falling victim to online scams.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-from-online-scams">How to Protect Yourself from Online Scams</h2>
<p>Knowing how to identify potential scams is only part of the solution. Here are some practical steps to protect yourself from becoming a victim:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Secure Your Devices:</strong> Ensure that all your devices are protected with the latest security software, web browsers, and operating systems. Regular updates can help protect against the latest threats.</li>
<li><strong>Be Cautious with Links and Attachments:</strong> Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown sources. They could lead to malicious websites or install malware on your device.</li>
<li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Use complex passwords and change them regularly. Consider using a password manager to help keep track of your passwords. (I LOVE, use, and <a href="https://1password.com/">highly recommend 1Password. Check them out!</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> Where possible, enable two-factor authentication for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of identification beyond just your password.</li>
<li><strong>Verify Before Sharing:</strong> Don’t share personal or financial information unless you’ve verified the person or organization requesting it. If you receive an unexpected request, contact the company directly using a phone number or website you know is legitimate.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Scams evolve constantly. Staying informed about the latest scam tactics can help you stay one step ahead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, online safety is a continuous process. By adopting these practices, you can browse the internet more confidently and securely.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-if-youre-a-victim-of-an-online-scam">What to Do if You’re a Victim of an Online Scam</h2>
<p>If you suspect you’ve become a victim of an online scam, it’s essential to take action promptly to minimize potential damage. Here’s what you should do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Report the Scam:</strong> Depending on the nature of the scam, you can report it to your local law enforcement agency, your bank (if money was taken from your account), or an appropriate online platform. In the US, you can also report scams to the Federal Trade Commission through their website.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Your Accounts:</strong> If the scam involved any of your online accounts, change your passwords immediately. If you used the same password on any other accounts, change those as well.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Your Accounts:</strong> Keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit cards, and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity.</li>
<li><strong>Contact a Credit Reporting Agency:</strong> If the scam involved your personal identity or financial information, contact one of the credit reporting agencies to place a fraud alert on your name.</li>
<li><strong>Seek Support:</strong> It can be distressing to be a victim of an online scam. Reach out to your friends, family, or professional counselors to help manage any stress or anxiety.</li>
</ol>
<p>Being a victim of an online scam can feel overwhelming, but by taking these steps, you can work to mitigate the effects and prevent future scams.</p>
<p>(The Federal Trade Commission has some good advice about <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-you-were-scammed">what to do if you were scammed</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the digital age, online scams are an unfortunate reality that we must all be prepared to face. Yet, with understanding and vigilance, you can significantly reduce your risk of becoming a victim.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to stay skeptical of unsolicited contact, especially if it promises vast rewards or pressures you into fast action.</li>
<li>Take the time to verify information before acting on it.</li>
<li>Maintain strong, unique passwords and use two-factor authentication wherever possible.</li>
<li>Protect your devices with updated security software, and be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being scammed can feel violating and disheartening. It’s important to remember that if you are scammed, it’s not your fault. The individuals perpetrating these scams are the ones to blame. If you’ve been scammed, don’t hesitate to report it and take steps to protect yourself from further harm.</p>
<p>By spreading awareness and sharing information about online scams, we can all contribute to making the internet a safer place. Feel free to share this post with anyone who might benefit from it. Stay safe out there!</p>

<p>For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</p>
<h2 id="isaiah-58114">Isaiah 58:1–14</h2>
<p>Shout out, do not hold back!<br>
Lift up your voice like a trumpet!<br>
Announce to my people their rebellion,<br>

<p>Yet day after day they seek me<br>
and delight to know my ways,<br>
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness<br>
and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;<br>
they ask of me righteous judgments,<br>
they delight to draw near to God.</p>
<p>“Why do we fast, but you do not see?<br>
Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?”</p>
<p>Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day,<br>
and oppress all your workers.</p>
<p>Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight<br>
and to strike with a wicked fist.</p>
<p>Such fasting as you do today<br>
will not make your voice heard on high.</p>
<p>Is such the fast that I choose,<br>
a day to humble oneself?</p>
<p>Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush,<br>
and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?</p>
<p>Will you call this a fast,<br>
a day acceptable to the LORD?</p>
<p>Is not this the fast that I choose:<br>
to loose the bonds of injustice,<br>
to undo the thongs of the yoke,<br>
to let the oppressed go free,<br>
and to break every yoke?</p>
<p>Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,<br>
and bring the homeless poor into your house;<br>
when you see the naked, to cover them,<br>
and not to hide yourself from your own kin?</p>
<p>Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,<br>
and your healing shall spring up quickly;<br>
your vindicator shall go before you,<br>
the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.</p>
<p>Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;<br>
you shall cry for help, and he will say, Here I am.</p>
<p>If you remove the yoke from among you,<br>
the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil,<br>
if you offer your food to the hungry<br>
and satisfy the needs of the afflicted,<br>
then your light shall rise in the darkness<br>
and your gloom be like the noonday.</p>
<p>The LORD will guide you continually,<br>
and satisfy your needs in parched places,<br>
and make your bones strong;<br>
and you shall be like a watered garden,<br>
like a spring of water,<br>
whose waters never fail.</p>
<p>Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;<br>
you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;<br>
you shall be called the repairer of the breach,<br>
the restorer of streets to live in.</p>
<p>If you refrain from trampling the sabbath,<br>
from pursuing your own interests on my holy day;<br>
if you call the sabbath a delight<br>
and the holy day of the LORD honorable;<br>
if you honor it, not going your own ways,<br>
serving your own interests, or pursuing your own affairs;<br>
then you shall take delight in the LORD,<br>
and I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth;<br>
I will feed you with the heritage of your ancestor Jacob,<br>
for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.</p>
<h2 id="ezekiel-34116">Ezekiel 34:1–16</h2>
<p>The word of the LORD came to me:</p>
<p>Mortal, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel: prophesy, and say to them—to the shepherds:</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>
<p>Ah, you shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?</p>
<p>You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep.</p>
<p>You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them.</p>
<p>So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.</p>
<p>My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with no one to search or seek for them.</p>
<p>Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild animals, since there was no shepherd; and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep;</p>
<p>therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord GOD, I am against the shepherds; and I will demand my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer shall the shepherds feed themselves.</p>
<p>I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, so that they may not be food for them.</p>
<p>For thus says the Lord GOD:</p>
<p>I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As shepherds seek out their flocks when they are among their scattered sheep, so I will seek out my sheep.</p>
<p>I will rescue them from all the places to which they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.</p>
<p>I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited parts of the land.</p>
<p>I will feed them with good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and they shall feed on rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.</p>
<p>I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak,</p>
<p>but the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed them with justice.</p>

      <title>Ask Me Anything: Software Engineering Questions from a Coding Bootcamp Student</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/ask-me-anything-software-engineering-questions-from-a-coding-bootcamp-student/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 14:10:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/ask-me-anything-software-engineering-questions-from-a-coding-bootcamp-student/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m posting my answers to these software engineering questions here, just in case anyone else finds them helpful! (Also, it gives me another link to share when I get asked these kinds of questions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-you-become-interested-in-software-engineering&#34;&gt;How did you become interested in software engineering?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a bit about &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/my-coding-bootcamp-journey-how-a-pastor-became-a-programmer/&#34;&gt;my coding bootcamp journey&lt;/a&gt; in a previous post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my interest in software engineering is/was related to the particular path my journey took. That is, while studying Bible/religion/theology, I always knew that “bi-vocational ministry” (ministering in a church setting while also making money from another profession) was on the table.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m posting my answers to these software engineering questions here, just in case anyone else finds them helpful! (Also, it gives me another link to share when I get asked these kinds of questions.)</p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-become-interested-in-software-engineering">How did you become interested in software engineering?</h2>
<p>I wrote a bit about <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/my-coding-bootcamp-journey-how-a-pastor-became-a-programmer/">my coding bootcamp journey</a> in a previous post.</p>
<p>Part of my interest in software engineering is/was related to the particular path my journey took. That is, while studying Bible/religion/theology, I always knew that “bi-vocational ministry” (ministering in a church setting while also making money from another profession) was on the table.</p>
<p>Whenever I thought about “careers that might be a good fit for bi-vocational ministry,” software engineering, web development, etc. were on the short-list. You don’t need a specific degree. You can make good money. You can work remotely. It’s not an especially emotionally draining profession (like, say, counseling, therapy, or chaplaincy). The list goes on.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I’m now “just” a full-time software engineer. I’m not having to balance things with working in a church setting. But it’s nice to know that I could have that flexibility in the future, if I wanted to.</p>
<p>And, in addition to all the ministry-related reasons that software engineering was on my radar screen, I really love <strong>learning things and solving problems</strong>. And that’s what I get to do each day as a software engineer!</p>
<p>I was born in 1991, so computers and the internet have always been a part of my life. I was always curious about how digital tools worked behind the scenes. After years of dabbling and tinkering in the shallow end of the internet, as it were, I was eager to take the plunge into the deep end of computer programming.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-typical-work-dayweek-look-like-for-you">What does a typical work day/week look like for you?</h2>
<p>Most days, I work from home. My company has an office here in Pittsburgh, but I’m not required to go in.</p>
<p>I’m expected to be available/contactable (via Microsoft Teams) from 8am-5pm Eastern. And there are various meetings I have to attend each day/week:</p>
<ul>
<li>daily squad standup at 10am,</li>
<li>weekly 1:1 with manager,</li>
<li>weekly “town hall” meeting,</li>
<li>weekly “tech sync-up” chat with other devs on my squad,</li>
<li>bi-weekly sprint planning and retrospective meetings, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of the meetings and general availability, however, I’m pretty free to get my work done when/as I wish.</p>
<p>Now, I usually get all my work done between 8am and 5pm anyway! But if I have to step out for a bit for a doctor’s appointment, to drop-off/pick-up kids, to run a few errands, etc., I can always put in the time needed to get my work done outside of business hours.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-like-mostleast-about-your-work-specifically-or-this-career-in-general">What do you like most/least about your work specifically or this career in general?</h2>
<p>I LOVE how my work requires me to continuously learn things and solve problems.</p>
<p>Sure, my work isn’t as “tangible” as, say, building a house. But, especially when compared with my previous work/studies in religion and theology, building software feels a lot more concrete!</p>
<p>Fixing a bug, getting tests to pass, building a feature and seeing it work for customers…all of these things are very satisfying to me.</p>
<p>However, the main downside is related: software engineering can feel very overwhelming because you’ll never know everything–or even almost everything–about the field. In addition to acquiring basic knowledge of programming, one of the main skills I’ve had to learn is <strong>how to keep making progress even when the task at hand feels confusing and overwhelming</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s taken some getting used to, going from being one of the well-informed “experts” when it comes to church, Bible, theology, etc., to being a complete n00b at software engineering!</p>
<p>But, even though the feeling of “I have no idea how to do that” is the main source of stress in my work these days, re-framing it as “I get to learn something new” is what keeps the work exciting!</p>
<h2 id="in-your-opinion-what-skillsabilitiespersonal-attributes-are-essential-to-success-in-this-field">In your opinion, what skills/abilities/personal attributes are essential to success in this field?</h2>
<p>You’ve got to be curious. A lifelong learner. Which, importantly, doesn’t just mean “I enjoy <em>knowing</em> a lot of things,” but also “I’m comfortable with the uncomfortable parts of learning something new.”</p>
<p>Are you OK with realizing that you don’t know something? Or does that totally paralyze you?</p>
<p>When you realize that you don’t know something, is your first instinct to go learn more about it and figure things out? Or do you tend to avoid that area of uncertainty?</p>
<p>Furthermore, what about when you don’t know what you don’t know? How do you respond?</p>
<h2 id="can-you-tell-me-about-the-hiring-process-you-went-through-either-for-your-current-job-or-others-you-have-applied-for">Can you tell me about the hiring process you went through? Either for your current job or others you have applied for.</h2>
<p>One of the reasons I chose my coding bootcamp, Tech Elevator, was that they included a pretty robust job-search component to the bootcamp. As a part of this, they set us up with a handful (I think I had 5) of brief (15-minute) “matchmaking” interviews.</p>
<p>Tech Elevator develops relationships with tech companies, usually with a focus on companies that have a footprint nearby one of Tech Elevator’s campuses.</p>
<p>So, in my case, one of the matchmaking interviews I was assigned was with Proofpoint.</p>
<p>To be honest, I hadn’t heard of Proofpoint before the bootcamp. And, once I discovered that it’s a large cybersecurity company, I was SUPER intimated. In fact, I straight-up told that to the two developers who did my first interview: “Look, Proofpoint sounds amazing, but I don’t know if I’m cut out to work for a cybersecurity company with just a 14-week bootcamp under my belt!”</p>
<p>Those devs reassured me that, even though Proofpoint’s a cybersecurity company, that I was not applying for a cybersecurity expert role, but for a junior developer role. That calmed my nerves a bit!</p>
<p>After my matchmaking interview, which went quite well (and, unlike my other matchmaking interviews, was quite technically focused…getting a sense of what I had and had not learned at the bootcamp), I made it to a 3-part second interview. 3 back-to-back interviews (Zoom calls, in my case) with 3 different groups of 2 Proofpoint interviewers each. I spoke with a technical product manager, a QA manager, two mid-level devs, and two senior-level devs.</p>
<p>Only the 3rd sub-interview was the dreaded “technical interview.” A mid-level and a senior dev asked me to whiteboard maybe 2 different problems. (As they taught me in the bootcamp, I went into as much detail as possible while solving the technical problem(s), so we didn’t cover all that many different topics.)</p>
<p>The devs were quick to reassure me that I was not being judged on coding syntax, but rather on problem-solving approach. I could either code in the language I was most comfortable with or write pseudocode.</p>
<p>I was quick to say that, in the real world, I would approach a problem by googling to see if a ready-made solution (in this case, for string manipulation) existed. I even mentioned the library/tool that I thought could do what I was being asked to do.</p>
<p>And, looking back on the experience, that’s completely true. The coding problem(s) I was asked to do in the technical interview was NOTHING LIKE what I do each day as a software dev. I would never ever spend so much time trying to put together a string manipulation solution from scratch unless I had already exhausted other options.</p>
<p>But, hey, there are only so many different ways you can test someone’s problem-solving skills. At least my interviewers clearly understood (and told me) that this was obviously a very artificial situation.</p>
<p>Anyway, it didn’t go <em>perfectly</em> (at least not in my opinion), but I was able to come up with a workable solution to the problem and, more importantly, thoroughly talk through my thinking as I went. I felt very well-prepared by the bootcamp for my interviews.</p>
<p>BUT, I will say that, outside of my other matchmaking interviews, it was quite difficult to get my foot in the door for an interview for other positions. There were plenty of jobs I applied for that I either never heard back from or received a pretty quick rejection.</p>
<p>This makes sense to me because, without any industry experience or a Computer Science degree on my resume, why would the average tech company give me a second look? For all I knew, my resume was getting filtered out by an algorithm before a human even looked at it!</p>
<p>Again, that’s one of the reasons why I chose Tech Elevator, and it paid off. They developed a relationship with companies to get students initial interviews. And they trained us, as people who were pivoting into tech from a variety of other backgrounds, how to pitch ourselves and compellingly describe what we brought to the table.</p>

      <title>My Coding Bootcamp Journey: How a Pastor Became a Programmer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Bible shortly before my first semester of college, I realized that what I was studying was not going to make me rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, throughout undergrad, seminary, and into a Ph.D. program in theology, the notion of “bi-vocational ministry” (serving the church while also making money outside of the church doing something else) was on my radar screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for a few months between finishing seminary and starting my Ph.D. program, I tried to teach myself the basics of web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Ruby on Rails. (I signed up for an account on &lt;a href=&#34;https://teamtreehouse.com/&#34;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&#34;&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; and I got to work!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Bible shortly before my first semester of college, I realized that what I was studying was not going to make me rich.</p>
<p>So, throughout undergrad, seminary, and into a Ph.D. program in theology, the notion of “bi-vocational ministry” (serving the church while also making money outside of the church doing something else) was on my radar screen.</p>
<p>In fact, for a few months between finishing seminary and starting my Ph.D. program, I tried to teach myself the basics of web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Ruby on Rails. (I signed up for an account on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> and on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> and I got to work!)</p>
<p>However, once I got accepted into a Ph.D. program (and realized that I needed to learn how to read in German ASAP in order to pass a translation exam), my programming learning fell by the wayside.</p>
<p>While a full-time Ph.D. student, I got some basic web design experience as the Managing Editor of a website. Most of my time was spent using WordPress, but I knew just enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous (i.e., to fix small problems).</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">the Ph.D.</a> did not go as planned. (More on that some other time.) Neither did that part-time website job. So, after months of searching unsuccessfully for church (or church-adjacent) work, I resurrected the idea of teaching myself how to code. I dove back into freeCodeCamp’s curriculum and started chipping away.</p>
<p>But it was slow going. Getting a tech job seemed like an impossible dream. And, although there’s a TON of information online, I desperately craved having teachers and fellow students I could talk to. (I’m a big fan of asking questions. All the time.) I wanted some personal help in order to put things into context, to see the big picture and the path forward to a job.</p>
<p>When I first started learning how to code again, there were always enough church-related job opportunities to keep me distracted from coding. After all, I had studied the Bible and theology for over a decade. My training was church-focused (<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/portfolio/cv/">just look at my C.V.</a>). So, if there were a church-focused job out there for me, obviously I should focus on finding it. Right?</p>
<p>After a particularly devastating disappointment (I was offered a church-adjacent marketing position that was then rescinded within 48 hours), I decided to go all-in on a coding bootcamp.</p>
<p>I’ll say more about my bootcamp selection process in another post. But I had my eyes on <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a> because (1) they published their job placement numbers (to <a href="https://cirr.org/">CIRR</a>), (2) they had a campus in Pittsburgh (where we were moving), and (3) their <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/coding-bootcamp/full-time-coding-bootcamp/">curriculum</a> contained not just coding information, but also a job-search component.</p>
<p>So, we spent just over $15,000 on the 14-week bootcamp in the Fall of 2021.</p>
<p>It was one of the most intense learning periods in my entire life! But I loved having teachers and fellow students that I could ask questions to. And I thoroughly benefited from the career coaching components of the bootcamp.</p>
<p>Tech Elevator not only taught me the (1) fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java and (2) the basics of responsive web design. It also helped me revise and re-frame my experience to help me find a tech job. I rewrote my resume. I developed an “elevator pitch.” I prepared for common interview questions, both at the HR and the technical level (the dreaded whiteboarding experience!).</p>
<p>Tech Elevator hooked us students up with a handful of initial “matchmaking interviews,” one of which led me to my current position! This was a HUGE help because, without a computer science degree or industry experience, it can be a pain to get past the initial application phase.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve worked as a software engineer for a year, I can say that doing a coding bootcamp was one of the best investments I’ve ever made.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, it’s not for everyone. I would only recommend a bootcamp if you are a highly motivated learner. There’s a lot of information to find and digest, and you need to have a real hunger for learning (and a willingness to make mistakes and be wrong as you figure things out).</p>
<p>If you’re considering doing a bootcamp, <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/coding-aptitude-test/">take Tech Elevator’s Coding Aptitude Test for free</a>! And dive into free “learn to code” resources online (like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> or <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>) to see if you like the kind of thinking that’s required to do software development!</p>
<p>That’s all for now, but I plan to keep blogging about my journey into tech. So, if you’ve got any questions you’d like me to answer, please let me know in a comment below! (Or use <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/contact/">the contact form</a> to email me.)</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: If you’re serious about biblical and theological studies, you should invest in Logos 10 Bible Software. &lt;a href=&#34;https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;amp;AFID=529204&#34;&gt;Do so via my exclusive partner offer for Logos 10 here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp;amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quit laughing at &lt;em&gt;How to Read a Book&lt;/em&gt; by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study computer science sooner rather than later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit laughing at <em>How to Read a Book</em> by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.</li>
<li>Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.</li>
<li>Study computer science sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when I finally became a Logos Bible Software customer in 2018 as a Ph.D. Student, Anglican Deacon, and Anglican website editor, it took my studies to the next level. I purchased a Logos 8 Anglican Silver package, <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/5758/barths-church-dogmatics">Karl Barth’s Church Dogmatics (31 Vols.)</a>, and <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/152651/dietrich-bonhoeffer-works-german-english">Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: German-English (34 Vols.)</a>, and I haven’t looked back since!</p>

<h2 id="logos-10-worth-the-cost">Logos 10: Worth the Cost?</h2>
<p>Has it been a pricey investment over the years? To be sure.</p>
<p>However, even if I just consider the amount of <strong>time saved</strong> (1) looking things up and (2) citing works (which Logos handles AUTOMATICALLY when you copy and paste quotes!!!), I’ve come out on top</p>
<p>This is not to mention the breadth and depth that Logos Bible Software has added to my essays, sermons, emails (I used to receive a lot of Anglicanism-related questions!), and blog posts.</p>
<p>Now that Logos 10 is out, I can heartily continue to recommend Logos Bible Software. If you haven’t done so already, I strongly encourage you to consider buying (or upgrading to) Logos 10!

<h2 id="top-3-features-of-logos-10">Top 3 Features of Logos 10</h2>
<p>Real quick, here are my 3 favorite things about Logos 10 (compared to Logos 8 and 9).</p>
<h3 id="1-its-faster">1. It’s FASTER</h3>
<p>Right out of the box, you can tell that they’ve tweaked things under the hood to make Logos 10 run faster (noticeably faster on my 2016 MacBook Pro) than previous versions.</p>
<p>Especially when you’ve got a large library (I’ve got 3,975 items in my Logos library right now) and you’re using multiple resources at a time, running Logos Bible Software is computationally expensive. So I’m glad that the Logos team have made behind-the-scene improvements to the software that have yielded a noticeably superior user experience on my end!</p>
<h3 id="2-with-print-library-catalog-you-can-add-and-search-your-print-books">2. With Print Library Catalog, you can add and search your PRINT BOOKS</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/print-library-catalog">Print Library Catalog feature</a> is a game-changer, especially if you, like me, have quite a few physical biblical and theological books laying around!</p>
<p>If you add those physical books to your Logos Print Library Catalog, then, as long as Logos has digital versions of those books, you can use the power of Logos search to help you find things in your physical books!</p>
<p>This means that Logos Bible Software can now help you take better advantage of the physical books you already own! Genius.</p>
<h3 id="3-church-history-themes">3. Church History Themes</h3>
<p>As a student of historical theology, I’m a bit biased here, but I think that most Christians these days have a woefully inadequate understanding of Church history!</p>
<p>Granted, not everyone needs to become Church history experts! But all Christians should know at least the broad contours and the major themes from Church history. Let’s learn the most we can from saints who have gone before us!</p>
<p>Logos 10 makes a big step forward here with the new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/church-history">Church History Themes</a> feature. It’s a fantastic way to get up to speed on some of the most important movements and topics from the history of Christianity.</p>
<h3 id="4-bonus-auto-translation">4. (Bonus) Auto Translation!</h3>
<p>OK, we’re into the weeds a bit here, because I realize that not everyone will be interested in this. But, as someone who (attempted) a Ph.D. on two German-speaking theologians, let me just tell you that I REALLY wish this feature had been introduced earlier!</p>
<p>Logos 10’s new <a href="https://www.logos.com/features/auto-translation">Auto Translation feature</a> makes it easier than ever to engage with works written in, say, Latin, French, or German right from Logos. I really hope that this kind of AI-assisted translation continues to improve, because there are so many works out there originally written in other languages. Plenty of these haven’t been translated into English yet. And, even when they have (looking at you, Barth’s Church Dogmatics), there’s really no replacement for engaging with a work in its original language.</p>
<h2 id="other-helpful-logos-10-bible-software-reviews">Other Helpful Logos 10 Bible Software Reviews</h2>
<p>I’ve only scratched the surface of the new and improved features of Logos 10. I’ll say it again, I strongly recommend that you <a href="https://partners.faithlife.com/click.track?CID=431490&amp;AFID=529204">invest in a Logos 10 Bible Software library</a>!</p>

<h2 id="software-testing-our-fields-least-sexy-superpower">Software Testing, Our Field’s Least-Sexy Superpower</h2>
<p>Coming into software development from a background in the humanities, automated software testing struck me as a kind of superpower. Until, that is, I had to write my first software test!</p>
<p>So I now think of software testing as software development’s least-sexy superpower.</p>
<p>Sure, tests aren’t very fun or glamorous to write and maintain. But can you imagine if other industries had similar testing powers?</p>
<p>What if your house could test itself and let you know when it needed repairs? What if your body could test itself? What if, every day, you could live your life in the comfort of knowing that you and your belongings were being checked for errors thousands of times? Wouldn’t that be nice? Imagine the security and freedom that such a life-wide testing suite could provide!</p>

</p>
<h2 id="possibilities-of-software-testing">Possibilities of Software Testing</h2>
<p>I don’t know how far away we are from automatic home and health testing, but I do know that automated software testing has the potential to make our lives much better as we develop and sell software.</p>
<p>Sure, software development can get incredibly complicated and frustrating. But what if you had a robust testing suite that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Caught bugs</li>
<li>Never “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf">cried wolf</a>” (“to cry wolf” = “to give a false alarm”)</li>
<li>Was easy to run, understand, and change</li>
</ol>
<p>Good tests can help us confidently and quickly develop world-class software that improves our customers’ lives.</p>
<p>It’s not just about catching bugs and passing tests. As Vladimir Khorikov notes in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unit-testing-principles/9781617296277/"><em>Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns</em></a>, <strong>the goal of software testing “is to enable to sustainable growth of the software project.”</strong> The larger and longer a project is around, the more beneficial a good testing suite becomes.</p>
<p>After all, a robust testing suite functions as its own form of <strong>documentation</strong> for your project. A developer should be able to read through the tests and quickly get up to speed with how the production code functions. They can then confidently make changes to the codebase, knowing that (1) they have a decent idea of how things work and (2) that the testing suite will alert them to breaking changes.</p>
<p>And, as we’ll discuss below, <a href="https://docs.craft.do/editor/d/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/836657DD-FF3A-4CE5-8565-F6945FE45D6A/b/C94D92D2-AC78-4BCC-AB6B-5388B77EAF8B#8434D46D-25CD-49D8-83AC-87FE1E45A738">well-designed code is easy to test</a>! That is, there’s an important connection between software testing and software <strong>design</strong>. When we run into difficulties writing tests, we should consider improving the design of our production code.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of testing difficulties…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516534775068-ba3e7458af70?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxNDIyNzR8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHxmcnVzdHJhdGVkfGVufDB8fHx8MTY2NTQ5MjMxNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt=""  />
</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-software-testing">Problems with Software Testing</h2>
<p>All too often, the reality of software testing falls far short of its potential.</p>
<p>Thanks to the “test early, test often” perspective of <a href="https://www.testim.io/blog/shift-left-testing-guide/">“shift left” testing</a>, most of us software engineers have to write tests. Most of our production code has an ever-increasing <strong>quantity</strong> of test code associated with it. (More on the different <a href="https://docs.craft.do/editor/d/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/836657DD-FF3A-4CE5-8565-F6945FE45D6A/b/C94D92D2-AC78-4BCC-AB6B-5388B77EAF8B#AA5E8A29-25DD-4777-80AD-37DF0A172857">kinds of tests</a> below.)</p>
<p>But the <strong>quality</strong> of our testing suites is often lacking.</p>
<ul>
<li>We still have to put out fires more often than we’d like</li>
<li>Our brittle tests “cry wolf” whenever we change anything</li>
<li>Our tests are difficult to configure, understand, and refactor</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, we’re not living up to our testing potential! Or, at least, <strong>I’m</strong> not! Instead, here’s what often happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>I make a change to the codebase</li>
<li>Tests break</li>
<li>I fix the tests</li>
<li>My <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">code quality/coverage analysis tool</a> lets me know that I need more code coverage</li>
<li>I either</li>
<li>ignore my code coverage tool or</li>
<li>add some low-quality tests to get the coverage that I need and move my PR forward</li>
</ul>
<p>This is bad! Don’t be like me! Don’t sacrifice test quality for test quantity.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-deljoshdel-we-test-better">How Can <del>Josh</del> We Test Better?</h2>
<p>What should we keep in mind when we prepare to write code, when tests break, when our code coverage tool gets mad, etc.?</p>

<h2 id="principles-of-software-testing">Principles of Software Testing</h2>
<p>Lots could and has been said about software testing. But I’d like to do an “80/20 analysis” of software testing and focus on the 20% of principles and mental models that yield 80% of the results.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-software-testing">What is Software Testing?</h3>
<p>Simply put, <strong>software testing is the process of making sure that your software does what you want it to do</strong>.</p>
<p>As we’ll see below, the “process” can be quite complicated and multifaceted. But, before we get there, note that <strong>the prerequisite of software testing is knowing (at least partially) what you want your software to do!</strong></p>
<p>This is a crucial point to remember, which brings us to our next principle.</p>
<h3 id="the-absence-of-errors-fallacyhttpswwwoodlestechnologiescomblogsunderstanding-absence-of-error-fallacy-in-software-testing-passing-tests-dont-guarantee-good-software">The <a href="https://www.oodlestechnologies.com/blogs/understanding-absence-of-error-fallacy-in-software-testing/">Absence of Errors Fallacy</a>: Passing Tests Don’t Guarantee Good Software</h3>
<p>The absence of “errors” doesn’t mean that our software is useful, that it does the right things for our users!</p>
<p>Mauricio Aniche shares the following two quotes/sayings:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Coverage of code is easy to measure; coverage of requirements is another matter.”</li>
<li>“Verification is about having the system right; validation is about having the right system.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the iterative process of software testing, we need to ask ourselves <strong>“Do we know what we want our software to do? Should we change the requirements to better meet our users’ needs?”</strong> Only then can we make sure that we are testing for the right behavior.</p>
<h3 id="qualities-of-a-good-test">Qualities of a Good Test</h3>
<p>Khorikov (2020: 67) notes that a good testing suite “provides maximum value with minimum maintenance costs.” But, to achieve this, you need to be able to (1) “recognize a valuable test (and, by extension, a test of low value)” and (2) “write a valuable test.”</p>
<p>To get better at software testing, then, it’s helpful to know what we’re aiming for! Khorikov (2020: 68) lists four qualities of a good test:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Protection against regressions</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Resistance to refactoring</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Fast feedback</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintainability</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how I would re-phrase that. A good automated software test:</p>
<ol>
<li>Catches bugs (no “false negatives”)</li>
<li>Doesn’t “cry wolf” (no “false positives”)</li>
<li>Runs quickly</li>
<li>Is easy to read and run</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, so we should just max out each of these four qualities whenever writing tests, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not so simple.</p>
<p>This is because, apart from Maintainability, the other three qualities are in tension with one another. You can only maximize two of the remaining three qualities.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.craft.do/user/full/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/97683B15-BF10-416A-B336-4182179A0E2A_2/bpWRZyrcBDzP71Nk97VopU9hJSQf30X0WDoxASNykDkz/UnitTesting04fig08_alt.jpeg" alt="UnitTesting04fig08_alt.jpeg"  />

(Image source: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unit-testing-principles/9781617296277/">Khorikov 2020</a>)</p>
<p>And, even then, you can’t completely forget about the last quality you’ve chosen not to prioritize! After all, no one wants a test that (1) doesn’t catch any bugs, (2) is so tightly coupled to the production code that it’s meaningless, or (3) takes forever to run.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508935620299-047e0e35fbe3?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxNDIyNzR8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxicm9rZW58ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY1NDkyNTcw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt=""  />
</p>
<h3 id="avoid-brittle-tests-maximize-resistance-to-refactoring">Avoid Brittle Tests: Maximize Resistance to Refactoring</h3>
<p>Should we prioritize any particular quality of a good test while we’re building our test suite?</p>
<p>While we need to keep all four qualities in mind throughout the testing process, I agree with Khorikov when he argues for <strong>prioritizing resistance to refactoring</strong>. We need to take special care to avoid producing “brittle” tests that yield false positives (“cry wolf”) whenever we refactor our production code.</p>
<p>Put simply, we need to <strong>test the what, not the how</strong>. (More on this in “<a href="craftdocs://open?blockId=9811D0C8-FEBE-42CC-BA53-9A767F01549F&amp;spaceId=032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07">Observable Behavior vs Implementation Details</a>” below.) Our tests should be as loosely coupled to the implementation details of our production code as possible. Instead, they should focus on testing the observable behavior of our software.</p>
<p>A related concept at this juncture is <strong>“black-box testing vs. white-box testing</strong>“:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black-box testing: testing a system’s observable behavior, its specifications and requirements, as if you had no knowledge of its implementation details or inner workings</li>
<li>White-box testing: testing a system’s implementation details and inner workings</li>
</ul>
<p>Black-box testing yields better resistance to refactoring. White-box testing might often uncover more bugs than black-box testing, but it often produces brittle tests that are too tightly coupled to implementation details.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as Khorikov reminds us,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“even though black-box testing is preferable when <em>writing tests</em>, you can still use the white-box method when <em>analyzing</em> the tests. <em>Use code coverage tools to see which code branches are not exercised, but then turn around and test them as if you know nothing about the code’s internal structure.</em> Such a combination of the white-box and black-box methods works best” (Khorikov 2020).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is resistance to refactoring worth prioritizing? Because, as Khorikov notes, unlike protection against regressions and fast feedback, which tend to exist on a spectrum, resistance to refactoring is more of an “all or nothing” aspect of a test.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The reason resistance to refactoring is non-negotiable is that whether a test possesses this attribute is mostly a binary choice: the test either has resistance to refactoring or it doesn’t. There are almost no intermediate stages in between. Thus you can’t concede just a little resistance to refactoring: you’ll have to lose it all. On the other hand, the metrics of protection against regressions and fast feedback are more malleable” (Khorikov 2020).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A test is either brittle or it isn’t. And, while the cost of brittle tests is relatively low at the beginning of a project (as long as those tests are catching bugs and running relatively quickly), over time, as a project grows in size and complexity, the costs of brittle tests and their false positives drastically increases.</p>
<p>The main tradeoff we’re left with, then, is between “protection against regressions” and “fast feedback.” And this tradeoff plays itself out in the differences between the main kinds of software tests.</p>
<h3 id="kinds-of-tests">Kinds of Tests</h3>
<p>Fortunately, even though it’s impossible to write a perfect test that maximizes all the qualities of a good test at once, we can and should use different kinds of tests in our software testing suite.</p>
<p>Keep in mind what’s known as “the pesticide paradox”–if you only use one type of test, or you fail to revise and evolve your testing suite, you’ll only catch certain kinds of bugs. To catch new defects in the system, you need to use different kinds of tests and constantly revise your testing suite.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s plenty of debate around the definition of test types, as well as when and how often to use each kind of test. Nevertheless, the following categories are commonly used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit tests</li>
<li>Integration tests</li>
<li>End-to-end tests (AKA System tests)</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework differentiates tests based on how much code they execute, how quickly they run, how complex they are, and how closely they mimic the behavior of an end user.</p>
<h4 id="unit-tests">Unit Tests</h4>
<p>Khorikov notes the disagreement on the precise definition of a unit test, but he helpfully isolates the following <strong>three attributes of a unit test</strong> that many definitions share:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A unit test is an automated test that</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Verifies a small piece of code (also known as a <em>unit</em>),</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Does it quickly,</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>

<p>And does it in an isolated manner.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, no one really disagrees that unit tests should run <strong>fast</strong> (#2). However, just what counts as a <strong>“unit”</strong> is a matter of some debate. Some people think that a “unit” is a single class or even a single method.</p>
<p>However, as we’ll see below, there are advantages to broadening the definition of “unit” a little bit to mean <strong>“unit of work” or “unit of behavior.”</strong> Doing so helps us to write tests that are loosely coupled to the production code, tightly coupled to business/domain requirements, and therefore resistant to refactoring.</p>
<p>I agree with Khorikov when he advises that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tests shouldn’t verify <em>units of code</em>. Rather, they should verify <em>units of behavior</em>: something that is meaningful for the problem domain and, ideally, something that a business person can recognize as useful. The number of classes it takes to implement such a unit of behavior is irrelevant. The unit could span across multiple classes or only one class, or even take up just a tiny method.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before moving on, we should also note that people disagree on what it means for a unit test to be <strong>“isolated.”</strong></p>
<p>What’s known as the <a href="https://medium.com/@adrianbooth/test-driven-development-wars-detroit-vs-london-classicist-vs-mockist-9956c78ae95f"><strong>“London School”</strong></a> holds that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>unit</strong> is a <strong>single class</strong></li>
<li>Each unit should be tested in <strong>isolation from all other units</strong></li>
<li><strong>Test doubles</strong> (mocks, stubs, etc.) should be used for <strong>everything except immutable dependencies</strong> (AKA “values” or “value objects”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://medium.com/@adrianbooth/test-driven-development-wars-detroit-vs-london-classicist-vs-mockist-9956c78ae95f"><strong>“Classical School”</strong> (AKA “Detroit School”)</a> maintains that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>unit</strong> is a <strong>unit of behavior</strong>, no matter how big/small</li>
<li>Each unit test should run in <strong>isolation from all other unit tests</strong></li>
<li><strong>Test doubles</strong> should <strong>only be used for shared dependencies</strong> (like a database or file system)</li>
</ul>
<p>It might already be obvious from my comment above about broadening the definition of “unit” to mean “unit of behavior/work,” but I prefer the Classical School’s perspective on testing. It’s easier to produce tests that are resistant to refactoring by following the Classical School’s paradigm.</p>
<p>Despite all the disagreements about unit tests, it’s safe to say that everyone agrees that <strong>unit tests prioritize fast feedback</strong>. They’re quick to write, run, and let you know if you broke something.</p>
<h4 id="integration-tests">Integration Tests</h4>
<p>Unlike unit tests, <strong>integration tests test more than one unit</strong> <strong>(although not the entire system)</strong>. This means that they tend to take longer to write (and longer to run) than unit tests.</p>
<p>(Note that, because “unit” is used in this definition as well, the arguments about unit tests bleed over into what counts as an integration test! What the “Classical School” calls unit tests, for example, would often be considered integration tests by the “London School.”)</p>
<p>What integration tests give up in terms of fast feedback, they gain in terms of <strong>protection against regressions</strong>. That is, they can catch more bugs.</p>
<p>This is because integration tests exercise more of the codebase than unit tests. They also focus on the interactions between system components, which means that they’re looking for regressions/bugs in areas that are outside of the scope of unit tests.</p>
<h4 id="end-to-end-or-system-tests">End-to-end or System Tests</h4>
<p>Unlike integration tests, end-to-end or system tests <strong>test the entire system</strong>. They take even longer to write and run than integration tests, but they emulate an end-user’s interactions with your system more than any other kind of test.</p>
<p>System tests <strong>maximize protection against regressions</strong> by exercising the entire code base.</p>
<p>Using all three different kinds of tests, then, is key to having a test suite that catches bugs and gives fast feedback.</p>

<h3 id="the-test-pyramid">The Test Pyramid</h3>
<p>Due to the strengths and weaknesses of the three different kinds of tests, the “test pyramid” model suggests that developers should write many unit tests, fewer integration tests, and even fewer end-to-end tests. The width of the pyramid represents the number of tests at each level.</p>
<p>Here is Mauricio Aniche’s version of the Test Pyramid, which adds exploratory manual testing (vs. automated testing) as a top layer:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.craft.do/user/full/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/AFC5E00F-399B-454E-88E9-96DF37822C93_2/a3yCuLMk35hMVojHrgkpkB9dy9tzOB9RlqBjWHdnCZcz/EffectiveSoftwareTesting01-08.png" alt="EffectiveSoftwareTesting01-08.png"  />

(Image source: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-software-testing/9781633439931/">Aniche 2022</a>)</p>
<p>The main reason to be <em>sparing</em> in our creation and use of integration and system tests is <strong>time</strong>. Remember, one of the four qualities of a good test is “fast feedback,” and this is definitely a weakness of integration and system tests.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because they exercise a lot of the codebase (and thereby increase our code coverage), integration and system tests are particularly good at catching bugs. So, if we want our testing suite to be good at “protection against regressions,” we need to include well-thought-out integration and system tests.</p>
<h3 id="code-coverage-good-servant-bad-master">Code Coverage: Good Servant, Bad Master</h3>
<p>Code coverage is a measurement of <strong>how much of your production code gets executed by your test code.</strong></p>
<p>On its own, “code coverage” usually refers to “<strong>line coverage</strong>,” meaning the number of lines of code executed by your tests divided by the total lines of code. (If you’ve got 100 lines of code and your tests execute 90 of them, you’ve got 90% code coverage.)</p>
<p>However, as Aniche (2022) notes, because the complexity of our production code involves more than just the number of lines of code, there are other forms/aspects of code coverage worth considering.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch coverage</strong> takes into account all the <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> branches of the program’s logic (coverage of <code>if(a &amp;&amp; b)</code> must test for both <code>a &amp;&amp; b == true</code> and <code>a &amp;&amp; b == false</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Condition and branch coverage</strong> builds upon branch coverage to consider each condition that’s a part of a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> branch (coverage of <code>if(a || b)</code> must test for <code>a == true</code>/<code>b == false</code>, <code>a == false</code>/<code>b == true</code>, and <code>a == false</code>/<code>b == false</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Path coverage</strong> is the strictest criteria, considering each and every possible path through the program’s logic (coverage of a program with 10 independent <code>true/false</code> conditions would require 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 test cases)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a perfect world, we might always want to shoot for 100% path coverage. But, realistically, achieving full path coverage for complicated production code is far too time-consuming to be valuable.</p>
<p>Khorikov lists two main problems with code coverage metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>You can’t guarantee that the test verifies all the possible outcomes of the system under test.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>No coverage metric can take into account code paths in external libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the former problem, the combination of implicit and explicit outcomes of the system under test makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to test for them all. And, regarding the latter, code coverage metrics do not take the use of external libraries into consideration.</p>
<p>Does this, then, mean we should not care about code coverage?</p>
<p>No! But, we should keep in mind that, as Khorikov puts it, “coverage metrics are a good negative indicator, but a bad positive one.”</p>
<p>This is related to the “absence-of-errors fallacy” mentioned above. That is, if you have very low code coverage, it’s a sure sign that your testing suite has problems. But the mere fact of a high code coverage percentage does not mean that you have a robust testing suite.</p>
<h3 id="mcdc-coverage">MC/DC Coverage</h3>
<p>Before we move on from code coverage completely, however, I want to mention what’s known as “modified condition / decision coverage” or “MC/DC” as a way to maximize the value of code coverage while minimizing the number of test cases required.</p>
<p>As Aniche (2022) summarizes it, MC/DC</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“looks at combinations of conditions, as path coverage does. However, instead of testing <em>all</em> possible combinations, we identify the <em>important</em> combinations that need to be tested. MC/DC exercises each of these conditions so that it can, independently of the other conditions, affect the outcome of the entire decision. Every possible condition of each parameter must influence the outcome at least once.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To achieve MC/DC, you list all possible test cases (those required if you were going for path coverage), before searching for “independence pairs” of test cases where (1) a single condition change (2) independently changes the outcome of the code in question. After finding these independence pairs for all of the conditions, you can reduce the list of test cases down to at least one independence pair for each condition under test.</p>
<p>If we’re just considering binary true/false conditions, then MC/DC requires N + 1 test cases vs path coverage’s 2<sup>N</sup> test cases (Aniche 2022, citing <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Investigation_of_Three_Forms_of_the_M/8ibStgAACAAJ?hl=en">Chilenski 2001</a>).</p>
<p>While MC/DC isn’t a silver bullet to solve all code coverage issues, it’s a great example of applying the “test the what, not the how” testing principle to the topic of code coverage. When deciding which test cases to (not) write, we want to make sure that we’re covering the aspects of our software’s logic that influence it’s observable behavior.</p>

<h3 id="well-designed-code-is-easy-to-test">Well-Designed Code is Easy to Test</h3>
<p>A deep-dive into software design and architecture far exceeds the scope of this overview of software testing principles. Nevertheless, there’s an important connection between software testing and software design.</p>
<p>Code that is well-designed is easy to test. And code that is difficult to test is often poorly designed.</p>
<p>When testing is integrated into the software development process, then any friction encountered when writing tests should raise questions about the way the production code is structured. Granted, certain difficulties cannot be avoided (sometimes requirements demand behavior that is inherently difficult to test). But there are often ways to improve the design of our production code while also making it easier to test.</p>
<h3 id="keep-domain-and-infrastructure-code-separate">Keep Domain and Infrastructure Code Separate</h3>
<p>This is the main design principle that Aniche emphasizes in his chapter on “Designing for testability” in <em>Effective Software Testing</em> (2022):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>domain</em> is where the core of the system lies: that is, where all the business rules, logic, entities, services, and similar elements reside. … <em>Infrastructure</em> relates to all code that handles an external dependency: for example, pieces of code that handle database queries (in this case, the database is an external dependency) or web service calls or file reads and writes. In our previous examples, all of our data access objects (DAOs) are part of the <em>infrastructure</em> code.</p>
<p>In practice, when domain code and infrastructure code are mixed, the system becomes harder to test. You should separate them as much as possible so the infrastructure does not get in the way of testing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping domain code (AKA “business logic”) separate from infrastructure code (AKA “application services layer”) is a key emphasis of the “Hexagonal Architecture” or “Ports and Adapters” pattern.</p>
<p>The business logic at the “center” of your application should only interact with external dependencies by interacting with ports (application services), that interact with adapters, that are themselves coupled to the external dependencies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.craft.do/user/full/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/163B4C46-ECC3-48AF-82E3-92646C4FBD7B_2/OPm3cFAMHapQQOhihmwAaLVGNND3FpEHM0Fw95If49Ez/EffectiveSoftwareTesting07-01.png" alt="EffectiveSoftwareTesting07-01.png"  />

(Image source: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-software-testing/9781633439931/">Aniche 2022</a>)</p>
<p>This “separation of concerns” approach to software design increases the testability of a system because it allows us to focus our testing efforts, especially at the unit-test level, on the most important part of the system—the domain code—without directly relying on any external dependencies (which could slow our tests down, make them unpredictable, etc.).</p>
<p>Keeping domain code separate from infrastructure code also helps us to avoid writing brittle tests by emphasizing a key principle behind “resistance to refactoring”—observable behavior vs implementation details.</p>
<h3 id="observable-behavior-vs-implementation-details">Observable Behavior vs Implementation Details</h3>
<p>At each level of a system, there is an important distinction between <strong><em>what</em> the system is accomplishing (the observable behavior)</strong> and <strong><em>how</em> it accomplishes it (implementation details)</strong>.</p>
<p>At the highest level, <em>inter-system</em> communications between applications are observable behaviors, while <em>intra-system</em> communication between classes inside an application are implementation details.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.craft.do/user/full/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/doc/836657DD-FF3A-4CE5-8565-F6945FE45D6A/B9F43CB1-DFFA-45E7-9072-18D1BBC56367_2/NBFvJV4sruSIntQaOKcRgfO8WpP7mNWeKI1pmI4eydkz/UnitTesting05fig12_alt.jpeg" alt="UnitTesting05fig12_alt.jpeg"  />

(Image source: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unit-testing-principles/9781617296277/">Khorikov 2020</a>)</p>
<p>Remember that, as we test each level of the system, in order to avoid writing brittle tests that throw false positives, we need to test the observable behavior, and not the implementation details.</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem like the distinction is between observable behavior and implementation details is the same as between an applications <strong>public API (application programming interface)</strong> and its <strong>private API</strong>. In languages like C# and Java, this public/private distinction is usually achieved using <strong>access modifiers</strong> (<code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>However, although a <em>well-designed API</em> has a public API that coincides with its observable behavior and a private API that coincides with its implementation details, it’s very easy and common for an application to <strong>“leak” its implementation details into its public API</strong> by making those implementation details inappropriately observable.</p>
<p>Khorikov highlights the differences here as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For a piece of code to be part of the system’s observable behavior, it has to do one of the following things:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Expose an operation that helps the client achieve one of its goals. An <em>operation</em> is a method that performs a calculation or incurs a side effect or both.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Expose a state that helps the client achieve on of its goals. <em>State</em> is the current condition of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Any code that does neither of these two things is an implementation detail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever an application “leaks” its implementation details into its public API, it makes it easy for developers to write brittle tests. As Khorikov observes, “by making all implementation details private, you leave your tests no choice other than to verify the code’s observable behavior, which automatically improves their resistance to refactoring.”</p>
<h3 id="four-types-of-code-complexitysignificance-vs-number-of-dependencies">Four Types of Code: Complexity/Significance vs Number of Dependencies</h3>
<p>In addition to the distinction between observable behavior and implementation details, there’s an important framework to keep in mind when determining how to test each part of our software system.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.craft.do/user/full/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/doc/836657DD-FF3A-4CE5-8565-F6945FE45D6A/FEB14714-FF80-4C38-A57F-7F190BFF4A40_2/zxxZxZZDo7qDyNjq1Sya4VF9CAK4SnL5jPb7pMnyNmMz/UnitTesting07fig01_alt.jpeg" alt="UnitTesting07fig01_alt.jpeg"  />

(Image source: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unit-testing-principles/9781617296277/">Khorikov 2020</a>)</p>
<p>Khorikov lists the following four types of production code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Domain model and algorithms (top left)</em>—Complex code is often part of the domain model but not in 100% of all cases. You might have a complex algorithm that’s not directly related to the problem domain.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Trivial code (bottom left)</em>—Examples of such code in C# are parameter-less constructors and one-line properties: they have few (if any) collaborators and exhibit little complexity or domain significance.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Controllers (bottom right)</em>—This code doesn’t do complex or business-critical work by itself but coordinates the work of other components like domain classes and external applications.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Overcomplicated code (top right)</em>—Such code scores highly on both metrics: it has a lot of collaborators, and it’s also complex or important. An example here are <em>fat controllers</em> (controllers that don’t delegate complex work anywhere and do everything themselves).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although trivial code is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid, well-designed software systems avoid “overcomplicated code” by making sure that code is either complex/significant OR it works with a number of dependencies, but not both at the same time.</p>
<p>Put differently, the more complicated the code, or the more significant for the domain layer, the fewer collaborators it should have.</p>
<p>Why? Because, at least from a testing perspective, collaborators are expensive and time-consuming to test. Restricting interaction with collaborators to “controllers” in the application services / infrastructure layer of our application allows us to be strategic in our use of <strong>test doubles and integration tests for the controllers</strong>, while spending more of our valuable time writing <strong>unit tests for our domain code and complex algorithms</strong>.</p>
<figure>![UnitTesting08fig01_alt.jpeg](https://res.craft.do/user/full/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/doc/836657DD-FF3A-4CE5-8565-F6945FE45D6A/D2685F77-D498-4959-9B7D-6FF2DEEAC26A_2/IP8Scjkvxo8Egqj2Fz8ly0vviNmuKTxCKtz97Fyfz5sz/UnitTesting08fig01_alt.jpeg)<figcaption>UnitTesting08fig01\_alt.jpeg</figcaption></figure>
(Image source: [Khorikov 2020](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unit-testing-principles/9781617296277/))
<p>If the classes in our domain code depend only on each other, they should be relatively easy and quick to unit test. Then, after checking as many edge cases as possible in our unit tests, we can judiciously test the happy paths and all other edge cases in our integration tests of the controllers in the application service layer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even if we do all of this properly, we still need to reckon with collaborators and dependencies at some point, ideally without making our testing suite prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to run! This brings us to the important topic of test doubles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620889276134-ea33a1084664?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxNDIyNzR8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3NHx8bWFubmVxdWlufGVufDB8fHx8MTY2NTQ5MjczMQ&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt=""  />
</p>
<h3 id="test-doubles-mocks-vs-stubs">Test Doubles: Mocks vs Stubs</h3>
<p>Test doubles (think “stunt doubles”) mimic the behavior of dependencies. There are various kinds of test doubles. Aniche (2022) lists five, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dummies: passed to the class under test but never used</li>
<li>Fakes: use simplified implementations of the classes they mimic</li>
<li>Stubs: provide hard-coded answers to queries (no simplified implementation like fakes)</li>
<li>Mocks: provide hard-coded answers to queries, recording the interactions that can then be asserted afterward</li>
<li>Spies: wrap around a real dependency object (not like a mock), recording the interactions (like a mock)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Khorikov (2020) helpfully simplifies this list down to just two kinds of test doubles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mocks (including both mocks and spies)</li>
<li>Stubs (including dummies, fakes, and stubs)</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s the difference between the two? Here’s Khorikov again:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Mocks help to emulate and examine <em>outcoming</em> interactions. These interactions are calls the SUT [System Under Test] makes to its dependencies to change their state.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Stubs help to emulate <em>incoming</em> interactions. These interactions are calls the SUT makes to its dependencies to get input data</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice two important things. First, mocks both <em>emulate</em> and <em>examine</em>, while stubs only <em>emulate</em>. Second, mocks mimic interactions that result in <em>side effects</em> or changed state, while stubs mimc interactions that <em>retrieve information</em>. This touches on another important principle: command query separation.</p>
<h3 id="command-query-separation">Command Query Separation</h3>
<p>According to command query separation (CQS), “every method should be either a command or a query, but not both” (Khorikov 2020).</p>
<ul>
<li>Commands: produce side effects, but do not return a value</li>
<li>Queries: return a value, but do not produce side effects</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way of summarizing this principle is that “asking a question should not change the answer” (Khorikov 2020).</p>
<p>Note that, in terms of CQS, mocks mimic commands while stubs mimic queries.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.craft.do/user/full/032236cd-2bcc-fa12-9dfe-e5564a597e07/doc/836657DD-FF3A-4CE5-8565-F6945FE45D6A/9A23E848-9BAF-4318-8874-FA36C3D793F6_2/x5OUyH6SgUYVQnLrLvyE0Bya9z3mvCQcJrtuH90Ndxsz/Image.tiff" alt="Image.tiff"  />

<h3 id="when-to-use-mocks-and-stubs">When to Use Mocks and Stubs</h3>
<p>A corollary of what we’ve just discussed is that we should <strong>never assert (verify) interactions with stubs in our tests</strong>. Doing so is unnecessary if our tests are correctly focusing on observable behavior, because stubs should only ever emulate steps on the way to our SUT (system under test) producing observable output.</p>
<p>A corollary of what we previously discussed about complexity/significance vs number of collaborators means that <strong>we should not have to use test doubles in our unit tests of domain code (and complex algorithms), but should rather save mocks and stubs for our integration tests of controllers and application services code</strong>.</p>
<p>Put differently: save test doubles for the outside “edges” of your system, where you need to verify interactions with dependencies that you don’t have control over.</p>
<p>When unit testing domain code classes at the “center” of your system, the only direct dependencies should be upon other domain code classes. And, since we’ve already discussed the benefit of expanding our definition of “unit” beyond “class” to include “unit of behavior/work,” <strong>we should use real versions of these “in-process” dependencies in our unit tests, instead of replacing them with mocks or stubs</strong>.</p>
<p>And, even when writing integration tests for application service code, when interactions with “out-of-process” dependencies are inescapable, <strong>we should only replace unmanaged out-of-process dependencies with test doubles. Whenever possible, we should use real instances of managed out-of-process dependencies (such as a database) in our integration tests, rather than replacing these with mocks or stubs</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, when replacing unmanaged dependencies with test doubles, we should do so by creating (and then mocking or stubbing) an adapter layer that stands between our application and the third-party dependency. In other words, even when mocking a dependency you don’t control, you should “only mock types that you own” (Khorikov 2020). This doesn’t mean that you should mock managed dependencies like your database (see above)! But it does add in a helpful buffer between your application and its unmanaged dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Much more could be (and has been) said about software testing! If I had more time, I would discuss the following. But I recommend that curious readers do their own research on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/parameterized-tests-junit-5">Parameterized testing</a>, which can help save time and space when you’ve got a bunch of test cases you need to cover for a single method</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/criteo-engineering/introduction-to-property-based-testing-f5236229d237">Property-based testing</a>, which leverages software to create and handle test cases given pre-defined “properties” or parameters that should be followed when generating possible inputs for your tests</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">Mutation testing</a>, which makes dynamic changes (“mutants”!) to your production code, and then sees whether or not those changes cause a test to fail (if, say, changing an <code>if (A)</code> to <code>if (!A)</code> causes a test to fail, then you’ve “killed” the mutant; if changing the logic of your program doesn’t cause any tests to fail, then the mutant has “survived”)</li>
</ul>
<p>…Not to mention doing your own research on testing libraries and frameworks in your favorite language(s)! (In Java world, that includes <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a>, <a href="https://site.mockito.org/">Mockito</a>, <a href="https://jqwik.net/">jqwik</a>, <a href="https://assertj.github.io/doc/">AssertJ</a>, <a href="https://pitest.org/">Pitest</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I hope that this overview of software testing possibilities, problems, and principles helps you to write better tests and develop better software!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">#ACNAtoo is a movement of survivors of ACNA-related abuse &amp; their supporters seeking justice, repentance, healing &amp; a healthier ACNA. This is an overview of the movement including what you can do to hear, to support, and to respond. By Whitney Evans Harrison and Conor Hanson. </span></em></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400why-we-are-herespan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why we are here</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2019, Cherin’s 9-year-old daughter confided in her that she had been repeatedly sexually abused by Mark Rivera, a lay catechist at Christ Our Light Anglican (COLA), the church they attended in Big Rock, Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeling from this discovery, Cherin immediately reported her daughter’s allegations to her priest, Fr. Rand York. However, instead of walking with her through this ordeal, Fr. York and other church leaders at COLA neglected to report the allegations (although they were mandatory reporters by Illinois law) and pressured Cherin against reporting as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resisting this pressure, Cherin reported the alleged abuse and in June 2019 Rivera was arrested and charged with felony child sexual assault and abuse. Cherin and her family were immediately ostracized at Christ Our Light for having gone to the police, which eventually led them to return to Church of the Resurrection (Cherin’s childhood church) where they hoped to recover as the investigation began. But rather than offering the care and support she hoped to receive from leaders she’d known most her life, the cathedral of the Diocese of the Upper Midwest instead supported Rivera financially, helped him find an expert defense lawyer, and accompanied him to his hearings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Cherin’s daughter’s allegations, Rivera’s nearly 20 year volunteer history at the church, and additional allegations of rape in 2020 by Rivera’s neighbor, Joanna Rudenborg, Bp. Ruch and Church of the Resurrection did not make the diocese aware of the crisis unfolding in their midst. Joanna, Cherin, and other advocates began pleading with leaders in the Upper Midwest to address the abuse and work to make their diocese safe for survivors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date,13 individuals have made allegations of abuse against Rivera, including child sexual abuse, indecent exposure, grooming, and rape. It was only in May 2021, two years after Cherin’s daughter first came forward, that the allegations against Rivera were finally made known to the diocese in a </span><a href="https://www.midwestanglican.org/big-rock/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Bp. Ruch, which downplayed the scope and seriousness of Rivera’s behavior, omitted the extent of his leadership involvement, and did not provide any direction or resources for additional survivors who wished to come forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite many months of communication with survivors and advocates, Bp. Ruch and his team dismissed their basic requests and concerns. Instead, they hired an investigative firm whose practices went in direct opposition to the survivor-centric standards for which they had exhaustively advocated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After advocating with Bp. Ruch and his staff for 7 months, Joanna came forward in a June 26 Twitter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ladyjessicahaze/status/1408916453848346629"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a last resort to outline her experience and advocate for accountability and justice, both for her case and for those of the other survivors, at last bringing public awareness to just how much lay beyond what Bp. Ruch’s letter indicated.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400what-is-acnatoospan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is #ACNAtoo?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a survivor-centric advocacy group, ACNAtoo’s mission is </span><strong>Advocacy</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for survivors of abuse in the ACNA, </span><strong>Accountability</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for key leaders within the ACNA to hold survivor-centered policies, and </span><strong>Education</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for all those within an Anglican context about the dynamics of spiritual/sexual abuse, and how to best prevent/respond to abuse in the church. ACNAtoo began as an advocacy group for survivors in the Diocese of the Upper Midwest, but we are here to support people in all dioceses of the ACNA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goals are to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be a separate third space for ACNA abuse victims to come, </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/telling-your-story/survivor-guidelines-sexual-abuse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">share their story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be believed, find </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and get directed to professional help.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocate for victims by communicating with church leaders and holding them accountable to best practices of abuse response and prevention.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Anglican churches on the dynamics of </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/acnatoo-blog/what-is-spiritual-abuse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiritual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and sexual abuse, and best practices in preventing and responding to abuse by generating and/or disseminating resources and content.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400what-does-acnatoo-hope-you-hear-from-their-workspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does #ACNAtoo hope you hear from their work?</span></h2>
<h3 id="span-stylefont-weight-400everyone-should-be-informedspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone should be informed</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent abuse, we need to recognize what it looks like when it happens in our midst. All adult members of the ACNA need to know what survivors and their advocates are saying about how Bp. Ruch and the Diocese of the Upper Midwest have handled abuse allegations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every ACNA rector should address their congregation about what is going on. Statistically speaking, every congregation has survivors sitting in their pews, and how their community responds to this crisis in their own denomination will communicate clearly how that community would respond to them if and when they seek help, advocacy, justice, and healing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each ACNA bishop needs to address this clearly with his clergy and diocese to ensure that proper guidelines are in place that empower survivors and maintain transparency. We hope that each diocese in the ACNA takes time in light of these events to reevaluate their policies regarding abuse prevention and reporting, consulting with reputable experts like </span><a href="https://www.netgrace.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G.R.A.C.E.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to establish survivor-centric policies and procedures for investigating abuse allegations and providing care and protection to survivors and their families beyond initial guidelines for reporting abuse allegations.</span></p>
<h3 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-process-of-justice-needs-to-be-survivor-sensitivespan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of justice needs to be survivor sensitive</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any situation of abuse, the voices of survivors and their families need to be heard and their concerns addressed by the ACNA community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the current crisis involving the Diocese of the Upper Midwest, the survivors and their families should be provided with the qualified, trauma-informed care of their choice at the expense of the Diocese, which has so far neglected to pay for any survivor care for Cherin, her daughter, or Joanna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, any as yet unidentified victims of Mark Rivera should be provided with a safe way of coming forward and assured of adequate care and protection.The process of discovering other victims should be guided by qualified, trauma-informed, and independent professionals, not by the ACNA itself.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">To read more of what #ACNAtoo outlines regarding the ongoing investigation into the Diocese of the Upper Midwest, please read the </span></em><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/acnatoo-blog/openletter"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">open letter</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from July 15, 2021.</span></em></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400how-can-i-personally-respondspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can I personally respond?</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand justice for survivors of abuse in the Diocese of the Upper Midwest by writing to your bishop, rector, and vestry.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your bishop to take steps to make sure that every ACNA ministry is equipped to follow best practices in abuse prevention and response. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate yourself about what a </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/acnatoo-blog/a-survivor-sensitive-approach-to-allegations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survivor-centric response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to abuse allegations looks like and </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about best practices in abuse prevention and reporting.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400how-do-i-prevent-abuse-in-my-own-congregationdiocesespan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I prevent abuse in my own congregation/diocese?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning about trauma-informed and survivor-sensitive responses to abuse allegations is a key component to identifying and preventing situations of abuse. #ACNAtoo has compiled a page of resources and recommended materials on their </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resources page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help you begin this process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key aspect is to know your own context. Read your diocesan, parish, and ministry policies about abuse prevention and response. Compare what </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/acna-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are in place with what you are learning about best practices. Reference the materials provided by organizations like </span><a href="https://www.netgrace.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G.R.A.C.E.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to discern how your parish/diocesan policies do or do not fall within these best practices. As you learn more about this, open up discussions with your fellow church members and work together to implement safer, more survivor-centric guidelines.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate yourself about the warning signs of </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/acnatoo-blog/spiritual-abuse-syllabus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiritual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.acnatoo.org/resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> abuse. Learning to identify the red flags in these areas can prevent abuse at the outset, as well as empowering you to serve survivors well as they identify their experience and seek healing.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400let-us-rend-our-heartsspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us rend our hearts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As shameful as it feels to be confronted with our failures, we believe that exposure is an invitation from God to mature and refine us. We are not passionate about #ACNAtoo because of a lack of hope; rather, it is because we hold on to our hope of Christ’s redeeming work that we have the strength to enter this process with humility and lament. This is an opportunity to become more like Jesus. This is an opportunity to be a denomination in which those who do not yet know Christ are drawn to him because we manifest his character, particularly in our response to this current crisis.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invite you to join us in our faith that the Jesus the ACNA worships is better than we have imagined. We invite you to ask him to build a new hope in you: that he wants to show you that he sees you and loves you wherever you are. We invite you to ask Jesus to grow your trust in him by opening your eyes to see God moving in ways that do not involve your exhausted striving, but rather an encounter with the living God who is active in the world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this moment, let us obey the words of the prophet Joel (2:12-15): </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yet even now,” says the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;</span></em> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">and rend your hearts and not your garments.” Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and repents of evil.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we can acknowledge the truth of what God is saying, and respond with humble repentance, with God’s help we can become people who can receive and give his healing power. He does not wish to bandage over the wound of his daughter lightly (Jer 8.11). He wishes to bring her resurrection.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m working my way through the classic job search guide <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3O8cnYK">What Color Is Your Parachute</a></em>. First, I’ll summarize the 7-part “Flower Petal” exercise—a comprehensive self-assessment geared toward the workplace. Then, I’ll share *my* results from the self-assessment.</p>
<p>Ah, but first, my <strong>TL;DR</strong>: <strong>If you’re looking for work, or going to be looking for work soon, do yourself a huge favor and buy the latest edition of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3O8cnYK">What Color Is Your Parachute</a></em>.</strong> Work through the book, especially the Flower Petal Exercise. It’s well-worth your time!</p>
<h2 id="the-flower-petal-exercise">The Flower Petal Exercise</h2>
<p>The Flower Petal Exercise is a self-discovery tool designed to help individuals identify their career objectives and life goals. Using a visual analogy of a flower, it engages users in an interactive exploration of their skills, interests, values, and professional aspirations.</p>
<p>The ‘flower’ consists of seven ‘petals’ or components, each representing a different aspect of a person’s work-life:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>People Environments</strong>: Here, you define the type of people you enjoy working with. Consider factors such as company culture, team size, or the sociopolitical views of your colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Working Conditions</strong>: This focuses on the conditions under which you perform best. It may include factors like flexible working hours, remote work, office settings, or your preference for a structured versus unstructured work environment.</li>
<li><strong>Transferable Skills</strong>: These are skills you’ve acquired over time that can be transferred across various roles and industries. For instance, project management, problem-solving, or leadership skills.</li>
<li><strong>Fields of Knowledge</strong>: This petal captures specific knowledge areas you’re interested in or have a deep understanding of. This could be anything from technology to psychology or even history.</li>
<li><strong>Level of Responsibility</strong>: This petal evaluates your desire for responsibility. Are you seeking a leadership role, or do you prefer a supportive, team member role?</li>
<li><strong>Salary and Level of Lifestyle</strong>: Here you outline your financial goals and the lifestyle you aim for. It includes considerations like desired salary, job benefits, and work-life balance.</li>
<li><strong>Values and Goals</strong>: This final petal is about your personal values and life goals, aligning your career with your moral compass and long-term aspirations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each petal is equally important, and the final image should give you a holistic view of your career preferences and strengths. The objective of the Flower Petal Exercise is to help you understand yourself better, providing a clear vision of your career path and enabling you to make more informed decisions in your professional life.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the exercise is not a one-time thing. Your ‘flower’ is expected to change and evolve as you grow, learn, and experience more in your life and career.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sermon preached on Saturday, November 28, 2020 (First Sunday of Advent) via Zoom at Church of the Savior in Wheaton, IL.</em></p>

<h2 id="if-there-are-two-things-i-hate-they-are-waiting-and-staying-awake">If there are two things I hate, they are waiting and staying awake.</h2>
<p>I hate waiting.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who knows me. I am absolutely horrible when it comes to delayed gratification. I’ve been known to open new boxes of cereal on the way home from the store.</p>
<p>And I hate staying awake.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who knows me. I’m convinced that nothing good happens after 10:00 o’clock at night. 9 o’clock, really, if I’m honest.</p>
<p>(Ahem, and my young children have driven this point home!)</p>
<p>Keeping watch all night long sounds like the worst thing in the world. I mean, unless you’re in the middle of a good book or an episode of Bake-Off, why not just go to bed?</p>
<ul>
<li>I hate waiting.</li>
<li>I hate staying awake.</li>
<li>I am impatient!</li>
<li>I am tired!</li>
</ul>
<p>And I’m wondering if Kevin or God assigned me this sermon on purpose!</p>
<p>Maybe it’s appropriate that I can literally see myself on the computer screen that I’m preaching to!</p>
<p>Friends, it’s been a long year. We last gathered in-person for Holy Communion on March 7th. I was the Celebrant. That was 266 days ago, but it feels like it’s been a few years.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve all been through a lot. On my end, while the Lord has proven faithful to provide glimpses of joy—including an addition to our family!—this has been one of the most difficult years of my life. I’ve recently decided to step away from my Ph.D. program for a year for the sake of my mental health.</p>
<p>It’s been a long year. And, I don’t know about you, but I am impatient and oh so tired.</p>
<p>As 2020 comes to a close, I’m tired of</p>
<ul>
<li>disease,</li>
<li>depression,</li>
<li>disruption,</li>
<li>deception,</li>
<li>division, and</li>
<li>death.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it’s very tempting to begin the new liturgical year today by skipping straight to Christmas and leaving all that unhappy junk behind us!</p>
<h2 id="but-advent-gets-in-our-way">But Advent gets in our way.</h2>
<p>As Fleming Rutledge puts it in her collection of Advent sermons,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the season [of Advent] is not for the faint of heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Well, to borrow another phrase from her,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Advent begins in the dark.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="you-see-advent-reminds-us-that-if-were-going-to-follow-jesus-we-need-to-stay-awake-and-wait-for-him-to-returnin-the-dark">You see, Advent reminds us that, if we’re going to follow Jesus, we need to stay awake and wait for him to return—in the dark.</h2>
<p>And yes, I’ll admit that “Stay woke, people, it’s dark outside!” is a hard word for the weary. But I think it’s a good word.</p>
<p>It’s certainly a much better word than “Everything’s fine, folks! Here, have some eggnog and, you know, try not to breathe on anybody!”</p>
<p>Because, here’s the thing: when Jesus tells us to watch and wait for his return to judge the living and the dead, he’s not telling us to sit down, shut up, and keep a stiff upper lip.</p>
<p>No! There are things to do.</p>
<h2 id="and-as-our-reading-from-isaiah-reminds-us-as-we-wait-for-the-lord-its-ok-if-weve-got-something-to-say-a-hard-word-of-our-own">And, as our reading from Isaiah reminds us, as we wait for the Lord, it’s OK if we’ve got something to say. A hard word of our own.</h2>
<p>Namely: “God, where are you? Why haven’t you torn the sky open yet? Why haven’t you come back to fix things?”</p>
<p>That’s how Isaiah 64 begins. It’s actually the second half of a lament prayer that begins by recalling how God rescued his people from slavery in Egypt. (Just like we just did in our sermon series on Exodus!)</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that God’s people promptly rebelled against him before they even reached the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Then, once there, they continued to break their covenant commitments to God until they received the promised punishment of exile.</p>
<p>But Isaiah hasn’t forgotten the exodus or the covenant.</p>
<p>God has proven that he <em>can</em> save. And God has promised that he <em>will</em> save.</p>
<p>So, what gives?</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are God’s zeal and might?</li>
<li>Why is he withholding his tenderness and compassion from his people?</li>
<li>Why have enemies trampled down the sanctuary?</li>
<li>Why has God hidden his face?</li>
<li>Why has God given us over to our sins?</li>
<li>Is God going to keep silent and punish us by refusing to rescue us forever?</li>
<li>Doesn’t he know his reputation is on the line?</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait, that’s not quite right. And this is very important.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-a-lament-about-god-to-a-third-party-this-is-a-lament-to-god">This is not a lament ABOUT God to a third party. This is a lament TO God.</h2>
<p>Hard words, yes. But words spoken within the context of a relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are YOU, God?</li>
<li>We are YOUR people. Why haven’t YOU rescued us yet?</li>
<li>Don’t YOU know that YOUR reputation is at stake?</li>
</ul>
<p>Friends, if you’re feeling far away from God these days, might I suggest that you start praying this way, with brutal honesty? God knows how we really feel. Tell him! He can handle it.</p>
<h2 id="but-theres-something-else-we-need-to-be-brutally-honest-about-as-we-wait-for-the-lord-and-thats-our-own-sin">But there’s something else we need to be brutally honest about as we wait for the Lord, and that’s our own sin.</h2>
<p>Yes, as Isaiah 64:4-5 notes, God is a God who “who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.” And this means that he’s a God who comes “to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember [God’s] ways” (64:4–5).</p>
<p>Did you catch that? <strong>Waiting for God means “gladly doing right” and “remembering God’s ways” by living according to his will! We don’t “wait for God” by sitting around and twiddling our thumbs!</strong></p>
<p>But, I suppose, even thumb-twiddling would be better than what actually takes place! As Isaiah 64 goes on to describe, God’s people keep sinning despite God’s obvious anger. How, then, can we be saved?</p>
<p>Verses 6 and 7 read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away. No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and have given us over to our sins.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, biblical lament gives us the space to air our grievances to God. But we shouldn’t stop there. We should continually confess our sins to God—both individually <em>and</em> communally.</p>
<p>Do you hear how Isaiah is speaking for the people here? There’s a solidarity between the prophet and the people that I think should also characterize the Church.</p>
<p>It’s not enough as Christians to say “not my problem” or “at least I’m not as bad as so-and-so!”</p>
<p>No, instead, as we wait for the Lord, we need to ask ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I need to confess and repent of?</li>
<li>What does <em>our</em> church need to confess and repent of?</li>
<li>What does <em>the</em> church need to confess and repent of?</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, we need to consider, in the words of our collect prayer, exactly what it looks like for us to “cast away the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light.”</p>
<p>And this is where the rubber meets the road, I think, when it comes to Jesus’s commands in Mark 13 to “Be on guard! Keep alert!” And “keep watch.”</p>
<p>He’s not talking about being paranoid, constantly checking the news, and what the kids these days are calling “doomscrolling” through Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Yes, on the one hand, we need to make sure that we’re not selfishly ignoring the real suffering around us.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, there’s a big difference between checking Twitter every hour to find out what we should be angry about and really listening to the heartbeat of the world’s pain.</p>
<p><strong>Friends, our problem isn’t that we’re starved for information and data. No, we’re starved for insight and discernment.</strong></p>
<p>So, if we’re going to read the news, we should first read our Bibles. And if we’re going to read our Bibles, we need to let the Bible read us.</p>
<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer correctly diagnosed a persistent problem when he said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We no longer read the Bible seriously. We read it no longer against ourselves but only for ourselves” (DBWE 11:377-78).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This particular facet of our sinfulness is called “confirmation bias.” Whether we’re reading the Bible or Facebook, we’re looking for things that confirm what we already think, feel, and do.</p>
<p>(And, in Facebook’s case, <em>it’s</em> showing us things that we tend to agree with!)</p>
<p>As we watch and wait for the Lord, we need to push back against this. We need to let judgment begin with the household of God (1 Pet. 4:17) and lead the way for the world in terms of confession and repentance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, without the help of the Holy Spirit, we’re going to, at best, lead the way for the world in terms of self-righteousness and self-justification! Filthy rags, indeed.</p>
<h2 id="in-order-to-get-out-of-this-mess-we-desperately-need-gods-help">In order to get out of this mess, we desperately need God’s help.</h2>
<p>That’s why Isaiah is so indignant in his lament. Sure, it’s not God’s fault that we sin. But we sure can’t save ourselves!</p>
<p>As Psalm 80 reminds us, we need our Shepherd, the LORD God of Hosts, to “restore us” and “make your face to shine on us, that we may be saved.”</p>
<p>We can do our very best to keep watch, but, as Psalm 127:1 reminds us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, of course, for Isaiah, that’s the problem! God has “hidden [his] face from us” and has “given us over to our sins” (64:7)?</p>
<p>“How then can we be saved?” (64:5)</p>
<h2 id="in-almost-every-biblical-lament-there-is-a-turn-in-isaiah-64-its-in-verses-8-9">In almost every biblical lament, there is a “turn.” In Isaiah 64, it’s in verses 8-9:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“YET you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.</p>
<p>“Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look on us, we pray, for we are all your people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is our Father. We are his children.</p>
<p>He may tarry, he may judge, he may allow us to experience consequences for our rebellion, but he will NOT “hold himself back” forever.</p>
<p>He will NOT “keep silent” forever and “punish us beyond measure.”</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<h2 id="because-although-were-still-awaiting-his-final-return-and-judgment-god-has-in-fact-torn-open-the-heavens-and-come-down-since-isaiahs-lament">Because, although we’re still awaiting his final return and judgment, God has, in fact, torn open the heavens and come down since Isaiah’s lament.</h2>
<p>God has not kept silent.</p>
<p>In fact, as the book of Hebrews reminds us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets [like Isaiah!] at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son” (1:1-2),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…at whose baptism the heavens were torn open and the Spirit descended upon him like a dove (Mark 1:10).</p>
<p>And God has not punished us beyond measure.</p>
<p>In fact, as Isaiah 53:5 reminds us, in Christ, God himself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, when Jesus’s body was torn upon the cross, the curtain in the Temple was torn in two, allowing us to enter the Holy of Holies with confidence by the blood of Christ!</p>
<p>Friends, this is what gives us confidence to stay awake and wait for the Lord’s return, even when it’s dark outside.</p>
<p>So, we can be brutally honest with God and we can confess our sins with confidence, even when the sun goes dark, the moon goes dim, and the stars fall from the sky.</p>
<p>We can gladly do right and remember God’s ways, even when the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we are God’s children and God is our Father.</p>
<p>And so, we pray to Our Father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look on us, we pray, for we are all your people” (Isa. 64:9).</p>
<p>“Restore us, Lord God Almighty; make your face shine on us [in the face of your Son], that we may be saved.” (Ps. 80:19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <title>It&#39;s Official. I&#39;m Hitting Pause on My Ph.D. for a Year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received word yesterday that the Ph.D. Committee voted to approve my request for “Excused Program Leave” beginning in January 2021 and lasting until January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of sounding like Captain Obvious, 2020 has been a particularly difficult year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempting to complete my “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” dissertation has taken a toll on my mental health as I ran into some major research and writing roadblocks right before and during the COVID pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received word yesterday that the Ph.D. Committee voted to approve my request for “Excused Program Leave” beginning in January 2021 and lasting until January 2022.</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding like Captain Obvious, 2020 has been a particularly difficult year.</p>
<p>Attempting to complete my “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” dissertation has taken a toll on my mental health as I ran into some major research and writing roadblocks right before and during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>Through therapy, medication, my amazing wife, and other means, the Lord has proven faithful to provide for me and my (growing) family during these difficult days.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after a lot of prayer and counsel, I’ve decided that stepping away from my dissertation for a year is the wise call right now. It’s the best chance I have to either (1) return and finish my dissertation while retaining my health or (2) discern that getting my Ph.D., at least at this point in my life, is not what the Lord is calling me to do.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, whether I’m “Rev. Dr.” or just “Rev.,” I want to put my time and talents to good use for the sake of Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>To that end, I would appreciate your prayers for the year ahead as I attempt to prioritize healing and ministry. I’m preaching again this weekend as Advent begins, and it’s a good reminder that (1) I love the Church and (2) I need to learn how to “wait for the Lord.”</p>

      <title>Josh&#43;? On the use of the sign of the cross (plus sign) in clergy signatures</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/josh-on-the-use-of-the-sign-of-the-cross-plus-sign-in-clergy-signatures/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures—unless it’s done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient—is pretentious. It’s showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I’m not making a claim about the *people* who use crosses in their signatures, their inner thoughts, or their intentions. For all I know, every single clergyperson out there says a prayer of blessing for their recipients every single time they use the sign of the cross in a signature. I’m also not writing this about any person in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures—unless it’s done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient—is pretentious. It’s showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.</p>

For all I know, every single clergyperson out there says a prayer of blessing for their recipients every single time they use the sign of the cross in a signature. I’m also not writing this about any person in particular.</p>
<p>I’m merely observing what I take to be the *connotation* of a particular speech act.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to use a signature with the sign of the cross in, say, a letter to a parishioner that you end with “May the Lord bless you and keep you.” In that case, it’s more obviously functioning like a written replacement for the sign of the cross that one would make with one’s hand if one were giving a priestly blessing in person.</p>
<p>However, apart from the immediate context of a blessing or prayer, I dare say that <a href="https://qr.ae/pNA4ts">most people just think it’s a plus sign</a>. Perhaps a typo when one meant to hit backspace? A new subscription service for personal communication? Or maybe the new-and-improved version of so-and-so now that they’ve turned a corner in their life and things are looking up?</p>
<p>I’m not saying that we clerics need to stop using the sign of the cross in our signatures altogether! A poor connotation for something (say, wearing a clergy shirt in public) doesn’t mean we should abandon it. I’m just suggesting that we should be more judicious in its use.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I’ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and &lt;em&gt;trapped&lt;/em&gt; often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and <em>trapped</em> often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.</p>
<p>I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!</p>
<p>However, as I see it, I’m writing it out here for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To commit publicly to seeking out counseling</strong> now that I’ve started my first try of medication.</li>
<li><strong>In case anyone else out there</strong>, currently experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, etc., <strong>needs a nudge to seek out help sooner rather than later</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If #2 above refers to you, please know that you’re not alone! Please don’t let pride or anything else get in the way of receiving the help that you need.</p>

Preserve us from faithless fears and worldly anxieties, and grant that no clouds of this mortal life may hide from us the light of that love which is immortal, and which you have manifested unto us in your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Ph.D. Plan (Or the Lack Thereof)</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-phd-plan-or-the-lack-thereof/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For months and months now, I’ve been praying for either (1) a breakthrough on my “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” dissertation or (2) a clear sign that I should quit the Ph.D. Unfortunately, after countless confusing dead ends in my endeavors to put Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer into precise conversation with each other regarding specific passages of the Bible, I’ve now realized that such an approach is not going to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For months and months now, I’ve been praying for either (1) a breakthrough on my “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” dissertation or (2) a clear sign that I should quit the Ph.D. Unfortunately, after countless confusing dead ends in my endeavors to put Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer into precise conversation with each other regarding specific passages of the Bible, I’ve now realized that such an approach is not going to work.</p>
<p>Perhaps I’ve missed something. Perhaps there’s a passage of Scripture out there that both Barth and Bonhoeffer wrote about that contains a theologically significant exegetical disagreement worth writing home about.</p>
<p>More likely: Barth and Bonhoeffer handled the Bible in different enough ways that comparing them as if they were two modern Bible commentators is a fool’s errand. Sure, it would have been great if, for example, they had a lengthy exegetical disagreement on whether or not Romans 7 describes the current Christian life. But I’ve been searching and searching for things like that, and I simply haven’t found them. Instead, I’ve found a cryptic student note here, a missing sermon manuscript there. This approach is simply not the dissertation that the subject matter requires. And it certainly hasn’t yielded anything <em>constructive</em> enough to meet Wheaton’s Ph.D. requirements!</p>
<p>This is the closest thing I’ve had to a breakthrough since starting the project. And, given that focusing on specific passages of Scripture was going to be the main thing that distinguished my project from other Barth and Bonhoeffer studies, this is a pretty crushing realization.</p>
<p>What’s more, I’ve essentially given up on using the “theological critique of religion” as a theological lens/scaffold, because getting clear on what Barth and Bonhoeffer meant by “religion” (an important step in understanding their relationship, I believe) was <em>not</em> helping me zero-in on particular biblical material. “Religion” is a slippery term in general, and it has many thematic tentacles, as it were, in Barth and Bonhoeffer’s writings. Construed a certain way, anything and everything that they said could be about “religion.”</p>
<p>So, where does that leave me?</p>
<p>Well, I’m convinced that <em>something</em> needs to change. I’m not prepared to continue sacrificing my mental, emotional, physical, and relational health on the altar of this Ph.D. Unfortunately, this isn’t exactly the clear sign that I should <em>quit</em> that I was hoping for. There are still other dissertation options within the realm of “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible.” They each have their downsides, and I’m not getting my hopes up, but they’re intriguing enough that I feel like I need to at least explore them before I call it quits.</p>
<p>The first step would be to revisit the secondary literature on Barth and the Bible and on Bonhoeffer and the Bible. Originally, I’d planned to briefly summarize this literature, mainly focusing on how what I was doing (examining particular Bible passages and reading them alongside Barth and Bonhoeffer) was different. <em>That</em> didn’t work!</p>
<p>So now it looks like I need to find an organic contribution to the secondary literature. I need to find some way that the particulars of Barth and Bonhoeffer’s theological exegesis goes beyond the portrait of the two theologians that’s been painted in the secondary literature. Hopefully I’ll be able to salvage some of my work on Genesis 1–3 and/or Matthew 5–7 to make an argument that goes beyond the secondary literature.</p>
<p>OR: I’ll realize that I have nothing of substance to contribute to this discussion, that others have done the work better than I could hope to, and I can go my not-so-merry way. In many ways, this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sunniegiles/2018/04/30/how-to-fail-faster-and-why-you-should/#6949cc94c177">“fail fast” option</a> seems preferable. I doubt that either Barth or Bonhoeffer would be happy with me for spending so much time thinking and writing about <em>their writings</em>, instead of thinking and writing about the identity and acts of the Triune God.</p>
<p>This means that, instead of transitioning to full-time work with Anglican Compass ASAP, I’m planning to remain a full-time doctoral student for this fall semester. If, by the end of the year, I don’t have any more clarity on this project, then I think I’ll throw in the towel. Perhaps I’m not supposed to be the Rev. Dr. Steele. At least not yet.</p>
<p>Sorry for the depressing post! Prayers are much appreciated. As I prepare for my fourth year as a Ph.D. student, I’m quickly running out of ideas and motivation.</p>

      <title>A Shameless Request: Help Me Buy More Books?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After realizing just how easy it was to lose access to the physical books that I own (now sequestered in my library carrel at Wheaton), on a bit of a whim &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/donate/573962246651661/&#34;&gt;I created a fundraiser to help my upgrade my Logos Bible Software library&lt;/a&gt; to either the Anglican Gold ($216) or Anglican Platinum ($582) libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading would help me in my preaching, teaching, and writing roles (as a pastor-theologian and as the Managing Editor of AnglicanCompass.com). I’ve already benefited immensely from the Anglican Silver package I bought when I got into the Logos Bible Software ecosystem a couple years ago (mainly to gain easy digital access to Barth and Bonhoeffer’s writings for my dissertation). I plan to stick with Logos—especially for biblical commentaries, systematic theologies, and reference works—because it allows me to quickly research, prepare for sermons, answer questions from readers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is not unanimous agreement about women’s ordination in the worldwide Anglican Communion. Godly and thoughtful Christians hold opposing convictions about Holy Orders and who is called to ordained ministry. You often see the results of this debate at the Provincial level—a national expression of the Church may or may not ordain women, in accordance with their conviction. But for the Anglican Church in North America this disagreement is internal to the Province, varying from diocese to diocese and bishop to bishop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is not unanimous agreement about women’s ordination in the worldwide Anglican Communion. Godly and thoughtful Christians hold opposing convictions about Holy Orders and who is called to ordained ministry. You often see the results of this debate at the Provincial level—a national expression of the Church may or may not ordain women, in accordance with their conviction. But for the Anglican Church in North America this disagreement is internal to the Province, varying from diocese to diocese and bishop to bishop.</p>
<p>This makes the ACNA a complicated place to be ordained, especially as a woman. However, I also believe that this diversity of conviction and practice is a strength of our denomination.</p>
<h2 id="unity-in-diversity">Unity in Diversity</h2>
<p>Since the inception of the ACNA, the College of Bishops has embraced a “dual integrities” approach to the ordination of women.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some bishops ordain women as priests and commission them as church planters.</li>
<li>Some bishops only ordain women as deacons.</li>
<li>Some bishops do not ordain women but will license a woman to serve in a particular church that requests it.</li>
<li>Some bishops do not receive women in Holy Orders at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specifics of which ACNA dioceses do/don’t ordain women can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QG0EDrpgGnfPf668T5qsnUcczUA_g6b3HjgbPC-aiTg/edit#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://anglicanchurch.net/about/#1582571780228-6ce9e506-048c">stated on the ACNA website</a>:</p>
<p>“<strong>Q. What is the ACNA’s position on women’s ordination?</strong></p>
<p>“A. At the inception of the Anglican Church in North America, the lead Bishops unanimously agreed to work together for the good of the Kingdom. As part of this consensus, it was understood that there were differing understandings regarding the ordination of women to Holy Orders, but there existed a mutual love and respect for one another and a desire to move forward for the good of the Church. This commitment was deeply embedded in the Constitution and Canons overwhelmingly adopted by the Inaugural Assembly (2009).</p>
<p>“In respect of the two integrities concerning Holy Orders, three matters were specifically agreed in Constitution and Canons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Province shall make no canon abridging the authority of any member dioceses, clusters or networks (whether regional or affinity-based) and those dioceses banded together as jurisdictions with respect to its practice regarding the ordination of women to the diaconate or presbyterate (Constitution, Article VIII)</li>
<li>Except as hereinafter provided, the norms for ordination shall be determined by the Bishops having jurisdiction. (Title III Canon 1.4)</li>
<li>To be a suitable candidate for the episcopate (bishops), a person must: Be a male Presbyter at least 35 years old. (Title III Canon 8.3.7)”</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, our bishops have agreed to disagree, honoring a diversity of convictions about ministry and mission. This is a model of Christian charity for all of us, a unity that does not demand unanimous agreement on every issue.</p>
<p>When my husband and I were first exploring the Anglican tradition, this unity in diversity attracted us. We were weary of the perpetual divisions characterized by theological hairsplitting and defensiveness. It seemed that, in an effort to defend doctrinal purity, many Protestant churches kept getting smaller and smaller by separating from those who disagreed with them on this or that issue.</p>
<p>Anglicanism, on the other hand, describes a willingness to hold together a lot of diversity within the bounds of Christian orthodoxy. Some Anglicans around the world are extremely charismatic; others more evangelical; others more sacramental. Some are very Reformed in their theology, others more Arminian. This felt like a breath of fresh air to us, and an opportunity to acknowledge that the Church—the global, historic body of Christ—is actually quite large and diverse. The Church includes people who disagree with me, and I am grateful to share Table fellowship with them.</p>
<p>Unity does not have to mean absolute unanimity on secondary issues and practices. I realize that some would consider women’s ordination a primary issue. But since the bishops in the ACNA have agreed to allow differences of opinion on this issue within the Province, it remains a secondary issue in practice.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-to-say-that-anything-goes">This is not to say that “anything goes”</h2>
<p>As canon theologian Esau McCaulley <a href="https://esaumccaulley.com/2020/01/26/come-let-us-read-together-a-hopefully-warm-invitation-to-think-the-best-of-each-other-in-the-womens-ordination-discussion/?fbclid=IwAR2Aafb_9UCW8j0W-F-DTzH-p2BvWfmszuPIQp0Yx6zLgjklU8u7cGFzkcs">noted</a>, there are certainly boundaries around what constitutes “tolerable” disagreement in the Church. This is precisely why the historic ecumenical creeds came into being, and this is why our bishops gather to have difficult conversations about questions of orthodoxy today. Therefore we can follow their example by practicing gracious respect for conscience within those parameters.</p>
<h2 id="bearing-with-one-another-in-love">Bearing with one another in love</h2>
<p>The dual integrities model gives us an opportunity to practice this graciousness. It provides the opportunity to “walk…with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” as the apostle Paul encourages us to do (Eph. 4:1–3).</p>
<p>I recently saw this happen at a diocesan gathering where members of a task-force who represented a variety of perspectives on women’s ordination presented together on ways all of our churches can encourage and strengthen the ministry of women in their midst. In addition to a unified presentation, they shared stories of how they had personally grown in respect for each other and become true friends through the process, despite their differences of opinion. As I heard them speak, I felt grateful to be part of a church that creates space for this kind of connection to happen.</p>
<p>This practice of “bearing with one another” is not only good for the Church. It is also good for the world. We live in a society that is characterized by polarization and ultimatums. “If you don’t agree with me,” we are told, “you can’t have fellowship with me.” Often this goes much further: “If you don’t agree with me, you don’t deserve to exist.” In light of this, Christians who can live peaceably together—even with significant disagreements—can be a powerful apologetic to the broader culture.</p>
<h2 id="laying-down-our-lives">Laying down our lives</h2>
<p>I don’t mean to imply that this is easy to do. With significant disagreement often comes significant pain. I know women who experience real discouragement and frustration, ranging from challenges finding a job (or even a discernment committee) to the inability to exercise their ordained ministry in their diocese. I also know men and women who feel uncomfortable bringing their children to Communion when a woman is celebrating the Eucharist.</p>
<p>And of course, the disagreement does not cleanly fall along gendered lines, or even diocesan or parish lines. The dual integrity approach is not exactly comfortable for anyone. However, my own faith has been strengthened as I’ve witnessed people on both sides steward these challenges with humility and grace.</p>
<p>And for those of us in Holy Orders, this personal discomfort can connect us even more deeply to the meaning of our vows. We promise to “share in the humility and service of our Lord Jesus Christ” who “humbled himself, becoming obedient even to death on a Cross.”</p>
<p>During their ordination service, ordinands traditionally lie prostrate—in the shape of a Cross—before the Bishop. This gesture has layers of meaning and is sometimes exchanged for kneeling (which—full disclosure—I had to do as I was ordained while eight months pregnant!). But the significance is the same: those in Holy Orders make vows of servanthood and self-sacrifice. And in the ACNA, we all get to practice humility and self-sacrifice when it comes to our disagreements over women’s ordination.</p>
<p>Would it be easier if we all agreed? Absolutely. Is agreement a worthy goal to work toward? Sure. But until then—if that day ever comes—there is also great value in learning to live together with differences. Some of my dearest friends are people who love Jesus, preach the gospel, and disagree with my ordination. They have made me a better Christian; and, I hope, a more thoughtful, sensitive priest. Our togetherness is complex, but it is a gift nonetheless.</p>

      <title>For the Good of the Order: A Plea for Charity on the Ordination of Women</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost every vocational deacon I know, when asked why he or she has not become a priest, will respond, “I have never felt called to the priesthood.” Some will add emphatically, “not for a minute!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not one of those deacons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t share this story often, rarely in its fullness, and never in public non-anonymous writing. Be gentle with my soul, O Church. The words which follow are all too raw.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I am not one of those deacons.</p>
<p>I don’t share this story often, rarely in its fullness, and never in public non-anonymous writing. Be gentle with my soul, O Church. The words which follow are all too raw.</p>
<h2 id="baby-steps">Baby steps.</h2>
<p>I first felt called to the priesthood before I claimed the word “priest.” It was a fleeting moment in the middle school mind, and easily abandoned. Children try on shoes, and my wandering attention during a dull class did take a bit of a look at the shoes labeled “minister” but set them aside as having too much to do with funerals. As a college freshman, it was the word “priest” that came and caught me in a lonely hallway, one afternoon. I presented it to friends as a joke, before it settled in on me during the weeks that followed as a very serious reality.</p>
<p>I read everything I could get my hands on. I was not yet confirmed as an Anglican, let alone having a theology of the priesthood, even less as a woman. I read the autobiographies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eleven">the Philadelphia Eleven (the eleven women ordained to the priesthood irregularly and as an act of defiance in 1974)</a>, and anything else on women priests I could get my hands on. I kept a journal, and I prayed. I took all the right steps, and when the rector of my church “back home” asked me out of the blue what I felt God was leading me to do with my life, I swallowed hard and told him what was on my heart. His response was, “Well the first thing we need to do is get you confirmed.” And yes, I was confirmed, by the Episcopal Bishop of Iowa, and my bishop back home in East Tennessee was very receptive to considering a young woman with a liberal undergraduate background in religion for discernment for ordination.</p>
<p>I look back on that sometimes and think of what could have been. If I had kept my mouth shut, nodded at all the right affirmations, and kept my feet on the path that had been neatly placed before me. It would have been an easy thing to just keep moving forward, to find myself twenty years later as a priest in the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>Instead of following the path before me, I veered from it. At a friend’s suggestion, I chose a seminary unsanctioned by the bishop of East Tennessee. I had a baby during my first year of seminary and began to question my priorities. I felt pigeon-holed into forms of ministry I never envisioned. In the end, I walked away from the ordination process entirely for a couple of years.</p>
<h2 id="vocations-dont-leave-us-alone">Vocations don’t leave us alone.</h2>
<p>Eventually, presented with a strong model of the vocational diaconate in my parish (by then in the Diocese of Pittsburgh) I again swallowed hard and shared my sense of vocation with the woman who would become my “mother in the diaconate.” I knew as soon as I did, it would again be out of my hands. This time, I submitted to the process; I let it unfold as it willed. I was ordained a deacon in June of 2004.</p>
<p>I would like to say that since then my call to the priesthood has gone away, but it has not. Most of the time, it lies dormant, but it has its triggers. Some have been intentionally put in my path by well-intended priests, occasionally even those in authority over me. Some I have simply had to stumble upon by chance, or in a more self-indulgent moment have sought out and examined anew.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-am-i-not-a-priest-in-a-diocese-which-would-happily-ordain-a-woman-priest">So why am I not a priest in a diocese which would happily ordain a woman priest?</h2>
<p>In short, the cost is just too high. I simply do not have the right to pursue my individual sense of calling at the cost of the unity of the Church.</p>
<p>Those who might consider themselves my cheerleaders, encouragers who accept the priestly ordination of women have as much as exhorted me, from time to time, that the place of women within the church was hard won, and perhaps I am betraying the sacrifices of others to step away from the path they have blazed. Yet they have blazed that path in rebellion, all the while taking vows of submission to authority and to the Tradition of the Church. Somehow, in the span of my lifetime, we have come, unwittingly, to rest significant aspects of our theology of Holy Orders, as they relate to women, on a secular idea of equal rights. To be clear, no one has a right to ordination, whether a man or a woman; ordination is quite the opposite, a setting aside of one’s personal rights for the sake of the whole Church. We follow a Lord who did not consider his own equality with God a thing to be grasped, but humbled himself to death on a Cross. And yet, we are conditioned to grasp and cling to our rights. It is the modern, Western way.</p>
<p>In practical terms, as a woman deacon I can go anywhere (or close to it) from women clergy gatherings to fellowship with bishops whose conscience would never allow them to ordain a woman. I can serve among Anglo-Catholics (the branch of the Church which holds my heart) but also among the Evangelicals, whom I hold dear. The whole Church is my people.</p>
<p>This is essential to me. In this mobile society, we should know now more than ever that our clergy are ordained for the whole Church, and it is the whole Church that bears responsibility for the actions of a few. Each diocese is responsible not only to its neighbors, but to our ecumenical partners and also to those whom we set apart as ordained leaders, as well. Many of our women priests, when transitioning from one diocese to another find themselves orphaned in a diocese that does not ordain women priests. Many of our “traditionalist” clergy are as easily orphaned when transitioning to a diocese that joyfully ordains women priests. The two so-called extremes are not as different from one another as they may seem.</p>
<p>But Christ did not establish a divided Church. We were made for more than this.</p>
<h2 id="women-priests-many-of-whom-are-my-friends-i-honor-your-ministry">Women priests, many of whom are my friends, I honor your ministry.</h2>
<p>I see the pain you’ve experienced and the sacrifices you’ve made. Yet I cannot see a way in which there can be a priesthood that emerges from an act of rebellion and division, as took place with the Philadelphia Eleven, that can be good or healthy for the whole Church. I do not see a women’s priesthood in Anglicanism today that is focused on unity over rights, on ordination as self-emptying rather than claiming our equality.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a failure of imagination on my part, but I do not see a path forward, on our current trajectory, for ordaining women to the priesthood that does not sacrifice our unity for the sake of our individual sense of vocation. Any viable and unified path will require deep sacrifice, and it will be women in leadership who will be required to make those sacrifices. We will all lay our vocations on the altar.</p>
<p>I do not believe the church has been kind to women priests. Many are simply trying to love Jesus and serve him the best way they know how. Yet the Church has systematically abandoned them to their ministries with no assurance of their place within the whole Church, shuttled them out of the public eye as if they represented a momentary indiscretion, and even subjected them to verbal abuse in our public discourse. This is not the tradition we inherited. It is not who we are to be in Christ. The early Church was a haven for women in part because of the intentionality of the Church’s empowerment of those whom secular society disenfranchised, quite notably women. Jesus himself surrounded himself with women. Paul called them fellow workers and greeted them prominently in his letters. Whether or not they were ordained to the priesthood, the early Church’s women were empowered for ministry. While some served as hospitality co-ordinators and nursery workers (or some ancient equivalents thereof), others served as missionaries, evangelists and martyrs, and yes, deacons. The modern Church has failed, in some places quite miserably, in this task of empowering women to serve in ways that fulfill our less traditionally feminine gifts and vocations.</p>
<h2 id="those-who-oppose-the-ordination-of-women-i-hope-you-will-understand-the-sacrifice-required-specifically-of-women-to-lay-our-vocations-on-the-altar-knowing-that-it-cannot-be-expected-to-be-received-by-the-whole-church">Those who oppose the ordination of women, I hope you will understand the sacrifice required, specifically of women, to lay our vocations on the altar knowing that it cannot be expected to be received by the whole Church.</h2>
<p>This is a uniquely feminine sacrifice, to be called and never empowered, to be shuttled off to birthing and raising babies (and being told that the painful and messy “miracle of life” should be enough for us), and to the ministry of hospitality and children’s ministry in some branches of the Church, when our gifts and our calling are to proclaim the gospel and make our Lord known in the breaking of bread. The women of the Church are often the walking wounded, caught in the crossfire of other Christians’ battles. Unless you look at women’s ministries through the lens of sacrifice, you will never truly see.</p>
<p>There are some, I understand, who are vocal in our Church’s public discourse, whose social media personae seem to be that of card carrying misogynists, but I know firsthand that they are no majority voice. In fact, rarely have I felt as empowered in my diaconal vocation nor as valued as a woman than I have when in the company of my friends from Forward in Faith, the REC, and dioceses that do not ordain women (some not even ordaining women deacons). Our conversations are often open and honest, affectionate and theological. We value one another. It grieves me that the tone for the whole church is not being set by these individual bishops and faithful believers.</p>
<p>In my own journal, I recorded a quote from Archbishop Beach shortly after his election to serve as our archbishop. When asked what he thought about the Church’s women priests he replied, “For the people on the other side of that issue, for me I feel we need to honor them and respect them and treat them royally” (personal journal, July 6, 2014). Many in the Church have done just that. Nonetheless, when the official statements come down—the sort which carefully balances itself not to offend either side nor to make progress in either direction—we continually fail to acknowledge that our women priests are sisters in Christ, our women deacons are caught in a perpetual crossfire, and our dioceses which do not ordain women at all are often missing any visible and healthy vision of women in ministry other than the stereotypically feminine roles. Many of us are just not cut from that cloth.</p>
<h2 id="vocational-deacons-my-own-heart-this-does-not-diminish-the-wild-abandon-of-joy-i-have-for-our-order">Vocational deacons, my own heart, this does not diminish the wild abandon of joy I have for our order.</h2>
<p>My love for the order defines my diaconate, and I see your own sacrifices and self-emptying defining yours. Each of us has had to lay lives upon Christ’s altar and acknowledge that it is not about us. Even our own vocation is not ours. It is about our Lord and his Church and the profound beauty of his creation, of which we are part.</p>
<p>I have been blessed to work with deacons (men and women) from coast to coast, in Evangelical and Anglo-Catholic dioceses. I have never encountered one who would not lay down their life for the unity of the Church and the gospel of our Lord. Every single deacon has a complex call to walk in an in-between world, fully in orders and yet limited, under authority, even at times wholly defined by what deacons can’t do. Every single deacon has a vocation of sacrifice. This small story is simply a portion of mine.</p>
<p>In short, it is from the diaconate, this foundational order, that I find the most encouragement for the future. While women’s ordination to the priesthood has, quite frankly, gutted the modern diaconate in the global north, the order has continued to hold fast, examine its heart, and increasingly take up its historical identity in connection with the deacons who have gone before. What is perhaps overlooked here is that the diaconate continues to need encouragement and development, despite being somewhat outside the fray.</p>
<h2 id="i-do-not-share-this-story-to-gain-your-sympathy">I do not share this story to gain your sympathy.</h2>
<p>I would rather not share it at all, most especially not in a church that sees every mention of the ordination of women as an opportunity to demonize one another and fragment further along party lines. I would rather hoard it to myself, and not risk becoming the next target of ecclesiastical angst and ire. I do share it, however, in order to remind the whole Church what is truly at stake here. I share this story because I see the Church as the only institution on earth which is literally called to hand-feed its members from baptism to the last moments of life, and I see that the Church of the Internet Age has traded that call for a culture that devours one another instead.</p>
<p>Our gifts and our identities are received from God; we do not make them ourselves. We have a responsibility to one another to hold those offerings gently and to lift one another up, to be merciful to one another, to sacrifice our own wills for the sake of the gospel. This is the diaconal identity, the self-humbling ministry of Christ, and it is therefore the foundation of all our Holy Orders. It is also the only way we have to move forward.</p>
<p>St. Paul struggled with such painful factions and divisions in Corinth, and wrote to the church in Philippi on the value of placing our Christian identity, as a community, ahead of our individual goals, however well-intended: “So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others” (Phil. 2:1–4, ESV).</p>
<p>What follows this passage is the great “Christ hymn” in which we are reminded that our Lord himself did not consider his rightful nature of the godhead as a prize to be grasped, but emptied himself to the point of death on a Cross.</p>
<p>There is no healthy priesthood that is sourced in an act of rebellion. It does not matter that the rebellion took place a generation ago. Neither does healthy discernment depend on our individual ambitions and personal liberties. Holy Orders must come as an act of radical obedience. There is no fulfillment of a diaconal vow that comes at the cost of the universal Church, for which we are to be servants.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-humbled-and-gratified-daily-that-our-lord-saw-fit-to-make-me-a-deacon-and-has-mostly-given-me-the-grace-to-be-satisfied-in-this-gift-which-he-has-given-me">I am humbled and gratified daily that our Lord saw fit to make me a deacon and has (mostly) given me the grace to be satisfied in this gift which he has given me.</h2>
<p>I am hopeful that we may someday be able to set aside our conceits and agendas and truly seek God’s will as one Body. I am convinced that my continued experience of a call to the priesthood is part of the Lord’s call to me to set aside what I may think even of my own self and let him fashion me instead after his own likeness. That is, after all, every Christian’s hope, sacrifice, and joy. I am also convinced that our Lord’s call to all of us is to a unity that loves one another, even as Christ has loved us, even to death on a Cross, no matter which side of our divisions we claim as our own.</p>

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the biblical and theological reasons for caring about social justice and systemic racism,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the unfair ways in which some have used accusations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Cultural Marxism to sideline legitimate Christian concerns about social justice and systemic racism, and&lt;/li&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(<a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/who-really-cares-about-the-trinity-josh-steele/">To listen to the audio of this sermon as it was preached on June 6, 2020, click here.</a>)</em></p>
<p>Christians believe that there is one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Or, as my daughter Eva put it recently after seeing a picture in her book, “Father, Son, and Bird.” We’re working on that…</p>
<p>We Christians have been taught that the Trinity is important. No one wants to be a heretic. Trinity, good. Modalism, bad.</p>
<p>But, quite frankly, who cares about the Trinity right now in 2020?</p>
<p>What difference does divine mathematics make when the world is on fire? When Black people are dying?</p>
<p>Don’t we Christians have more important things to worry about?</p>
<p>I’m tempted to just sit in silence and then skip to the creed. It sure wouldn’t be the worst Trinity sermon!</p>
<p>But friends, though I readily confess</p>
<ul>
<li>my inadequacy,</li>
<li>my anger, and</li>
<li>the inadequacy of my anger,</li>
</ul>
<p>it falls to me, a young white priest, to preach the gospel on Trinity Saturday 2020.</p>
<p>So, preach I will.</p>
<h2 id="the-trinity-and-the-bible">The Trinity and the Bible</h2>
<p>But please, bear with me! My sermon has changed a lot in recent days.</p>
<p>Originally, the whole thing was going to be about how the Trinity is not an abstract list of thoughts be thunk about God.</p>
<p>Instead, the Trinity is how the Church reads the Bible.</p>
<p>And let me just say a little bit more about that, because I think it’s really important.</p>
<p>The Church developed the doctrine of the Trinity in order to make sense of the Bible as the single story of how the one true God</p>
<ul>
<li>creates the world,</li>
<li>refuses to let it fall into nothingness due to sin,</li>
<li>redeems it through Jesus Christ and</li>
<li>brings it to perfection through the Holy Spirit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="without-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity">Without the Doctrine of the Trinity…</h2>
<p>Without the doctrine of the Trinity, the Bible falls apart into <em>fragments</em>.</p>
<p>What do we do with YHWH?</p>
<p>With God’s Spirit?</p>
<p>With God’s Son, Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>Are these <em>three</em> different gods?</p>
<p>Is just <em>one</em> of them god?</p>
<p>Are <em>none</em> of them god, but just <em>masks</em> that God wears?</p>
<p>Without the doctrine of the Trinity, at best, we’re either</p>
<ul>
<li>polytheists, who worship more than one god</li>
<li>idolaters, who worship things that God made</li>
<li>or we’re completely unsure of who the true God really is.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="with-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity">With the doctrine of the Trinity…</h2>
<p><em>With</em> the doctrine of the Trinity, however, we can trust that God is who he has revealed himself to be in Scripture and in the life of the Church—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This is God’s <em>proper name</em>.</p>
<p>With the doctrine of the Trinity, we can trust, especially in difficult times, that we worship the same God who called the world into existence and order out of nothing.</p>
<p>We worship the same God</p>
<ul>
<li>who rescued his people from slavery in Egypt.</li>
<li>who brought his people back from exile by going into exile for them at the cross.</li>
<li>who raised Jesus Christ from the grave.</li>
<li>who exalted Jesus to his right hand, where he now sits enthroned over the universe.</li>
<li>who poured out his Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and like <em>that</em>, can break down linguistic, social, and racial barriers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The doctrine of the Trinity reminds us that we worship the same God who, since Pentecost, has equipped and empowered his Church in every generation—through <em>persecutions</em>, <em>plagues</em>, and <em>prejudices</em>— to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything” that Jesus commanded.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so-yes-i-think-we-should-care-about-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity-especially-in-2020">So, yes, I think we <em>should</em> care about the doctrine of the Trinity, especially in 2020.</h2>
<p>Because some Christians, especially some white Christians, seem to have forgotten that all human beings are created in the image of the Triune God.</p>
<p>All human beings are therefore worthy of <em>dignity</em>, <em>respect</em>, and <em>self-sacrifice for their well-being</em>.</p>
<p>We’re supposed to extend God’s rule and reign throughout the world as good stewards, instead of exploiting creation and other human beings for our own gain.</p>
<p>We should care about the Trinity in 2020, because some of us seem to have forgotten that the Triune God is always and everywhere in control, so we don’t need to be driven by <em>fear</em>.</p>
<p>Some of us seem to have forgotten that Jesus has “all authority in heaven and on earth,” so we don’t need to curry favor with tyrants or Trumps in order to accomplish our Great Commission.</p>
<p>We Christians should care about the Trinity in 2020 because we are image-bearers of the Triune God, commissioned to make disciples of Jesus Christ in all the diverse people groups of the world.</p>
<h2 id="now-lets-just-take-a-moment-and-ask-ourselves-how-is-that-going">Now, let’s just take a moment and ask ourselves: How is that going?</h2>
<p>Let judgment begin with the household of God!</p>
<p>How much of the chaos around us is due to a failure of the Church to make obedient disciples of Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>After all, Jesus didn’t commission us to make disciples of Fox News, or MSNBC, or even NPR!</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t command us to baptize our greed, our nationalism, or our racism in the unholy water of civil religion.</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t tell us that we only had to obey certain things that he said.</p>
<ul>
<li>He didn’t say it was OK for liberals to ignore his sexual ethic.</li>
<li>And he didn’t say it was OK for conservatives to ignore his social ethic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, speaking with the full authority of the Triune God, Jesus told us to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, obviously, I don’t think the church has ever completely failed to live out her mission, or else there wouldn’t be a church today to preach to!</p>
<p>But, brothers and sisters, as we rightly lament the current state of things, I think we need to ask ourselves if the church has failed to make disciples.</p>
<p>Disciples of Jesus are people who</p>
<ul>
<li>look,</li>
<li>think, and</li>
<li>act like Jesus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do we look, think, and act like Jesus?</p>
<p>Or do we think that Jesus looks, thinks, and acts like us?</p>
<h2 id="now-let-me-take-a-deep-breath-here-and-say-that-ive-been-preaching-at-a-much-broader-target-in-this-sermon-than-just-church-of-the-savior-in-wheaton-il">Now, let me take a deep breath here and say that I’ve been preaching at a much broader target in this sermon than just Church of the Savior in Wheaton, IL!</h2>
<p>I thank God for how he has blessed our church with godly leaders and laypeople who are willing to consider the gospel’s implications for all of life.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call our local church a nationalist church or a racist church, and I thank God for that.</p>
<h2 id="nevertheless-its-not-enough-to-congratulate-ourselves-that-were-not-as-bad-as-other-churches">Nevertheless, it’s not enough to congratulate ourselves that we’re not as bad as other churches.</h2>
<p>There is always room for growth!</p>
<p>How, then, should we live?</p>
<p>Well, SO MUCH could be said, but here’s what I think we need to focus on.</p>
<h2 id="as-image-bearers-of-the-triune-god-in-2020-we-need-to-ask-ourselves-what-it-would-look-like-to-be-and-make-disciples-of-jesus-who-take-a-stand-for-biblical-justice-against-the-systemic-sin-of-racism">As image-bearers of the Triune God in 2020, we need to ask ourselves what it would look like to be and make disciples of Jesus who take a stand for biblical justice against the systemic sin of racism.</h2>
<p>I don’t have all the answers, but I do have 3 suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="first-we-need-to-read-the-bible">First, we need to read the Bible.</h3>
<p>We need to be so thoroughly familiar with the Bible that we can explain our biblical and theological reasons for taking a stand against the systemic sin of racism.</p>
<p>Let it be known that, as Christians, we are not against racism because we’re trying to impress our liberal friends!</p>
<p>We are against racism because we’ve read our Bibles and recognized that the Triune God is against racism!</p>
<p>At minimum, the doctrine of the Trinity reminds us that God’s oneness has never meant sameness.</p>
<p>When we read the narrative of Scripture, it becomes clear that God is not colorblind, and neither should we be as we make disciples of all the <em>ethne</em>, all the people groups of the world.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to a world that desperately needs hope! Let’s not waste that opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="second-we-christians-especially-we-white-anglican-christians-need-to-familiarize-ourselves-with-the-history-of-racism-the-united-states-of-america">Second, we Christians, ESPECIALLY we white Anglican Christians, need to familiarize ourselves with the history of racism the United States of America.</h3>
<p>We can’t understand the current state of things if we are ignorant of America’s racist history and white Anglican Christians’ complicity in it.</p>
<p>Frankly, I do not know enough about this myself, so, in addition to reading our Bibles, I invite you to join me in reading books like Jemar Tisby’s <em>The Color of Compromise</em> and Ibram X. Kendi’s <em>Stamped from the Beginning</em>.</p>
<p>We also all need to read Esau McCaulley’s <em>Reading While Black</em> when it comes out in a few months!</p>
<h3 id="third-we-need-to-take-action">Third, we need to take action.</h3>
<p>Reading our Bibles and learning more about the history of racism in America are good starts. But they’re not enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to listen and learn from the example of the Black Church about what it looks like to take a biblical stand against injustice.</li>
<li>We need to develop diverse relationships.</li>
<li>We white Christians need to listen to people of color, without expecting them to solve all of our problems for us.</li>
<li>We need to raise up leaders of color within the church.</li>
<li>We need to give money to leaders of color and the ministries that they lead.</li>
<li>We need to let our bishops know that we want the Anglican Church in North America to look more like the North America we’re called to serve.</li>
<li>We need to speak up and call out racism even when it’s costly to do so and especially when it’s coming from an elected or an ordained leader.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="now-is-anyone-else-feeling-overwhelmed">Now, is anyone else feeling overwhelmed?</h2>
<p>I mean, does our church, does <em>the</em> church, have the strength to fulfill the Great Commission when things have gone so horribly wrong?</p>
<p>No, she doesn’t. And she never has.</p>
<p>But perhaps you’ve noticed that I’ve not yet quoted the last part of the Great Commission.</p>
<p>We need to hear it, though, because it’s the most important part.</p>
<h3 id="jesus-said-and-surely-i-am-with-you-always-to-the-very-end-of-the-age">Jesus said: “And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</h3>
<p>Without that promise, the Great Commission is an unbearable burden, an impossible command.</p>
<p>But <em>with</em> that promise, the Great Commission is good news, even in 2020.</p>
<p>It might not feel like it some days, but the end of the age has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t promise to be with us</p>
<ul>
<li>until COVID-19 forced us to meet online,</li>
<li>until George Floyd and countless others were murdered, or</li>
<li>until the President profaned the Word of God for a photo op.</li>
</ul>
<p>No, Jesus promised to be with us until the END.</p>
<p>Until “God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people”—his people from every tribe and tongue and nation!—“and God himself will be with them and be their God. ‘He will wipe every tear”—every tear-gassed tear!—from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”</p>
<p>Friends, this is why we should care about the Trinity!</p>
<p>If Christ is with us, then the Triune God is with us.</p>
<p>And if the Triune God is with us, then we can make disciples and not be afraid, no matter how bad things get!</p>
<p>For no one, nothing, not even the gates of Hell will prevail against Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>Amen. Amen. Amen.</p>

      <title>Top 3 Books, Movies, and Podcasts about Race for White Christians like Me</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/top-3-books-movies-and-podcasts-about-race-for-white-christians-like-me/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are PLENTY of resource recommendations out there for those interested in learning more about racism and anti-racism (just Google “best X (books, movies, podcasts, etc.) on racism,” “antiracist reading list,” etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’m worried that, especially for people who are not used to working their way through lengthy reading lists, getting so many recommendations at once will lead to nothing due to the paradox of choice. I’d much rather recommend a single book that someone will actually read than 100 books they won’t!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>However, I’m worried that, especially for people who are not used to working their way through lengthy reading lists, getting so many recommendations at once will lead to nothing due to the paradox of choice. I’d much rather recommend a single book that someone will actually read than 100 books they won’t!</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is the reading, viewing, and listening shortlist that I am starting with. I’ve been biblically and theologically opposed to racism for awhile now, but I was convicted by the Rev. Canon Dr. Esau McCaulley recently when he said, like a good professor, that “we can tell when you haven’t done the reading.” I’ve done a <em>bit</em> of the reading (mainly <a href="https://amzn.to/2zULBBn"><em>The Christian Imagination: Theology and the Origins of Race</em></a> by Willie James Jennings, <a href="https://amzn.to/3eUpvxz"><em>A Black Theology of Liberation</em></a> by James Cone, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2XyMloK"><em>How to be an Antiracist</em></a> by Ibram X. Kendi), but not nearly enough.</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking for a place to start, I recommend the following as a beginning. Within each category, take a brief look at all 3 and then start with the 1 that interests you the most.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2A8Lylg"> <em>White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism</em> </a>by Robin DiAngelo</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2XyMloK"><em>How to be an Antiracist</em></a> by Ibram X. Kendi (I’ve listened to this on Audible, but I need to revisit it, along with Kendi’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2UfR3Wh"> <em>Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America</em></a>)</li>

      <title>“But, What About the Riots and Lawlessness?”</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/but-what-about-the-riots-and-lawlessness/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 21:47:31 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/but-what-about-the-riots-and-lawlessness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I commend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/race-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-one.html&#34;&gt;the entire interview series that Ed Stetzer recently did with Esau McCaulley&lt;/a&gt;. Among many highlights, I appreciate McCaulley’s following answer to the question of negotiating the differences between protests and riots. Again, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/racism-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-four.html&#34;&gt;read the whole interview&lt;/a&gt; and series, but here’s a key section related to concern about rioting and lawlessness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Ed Stetzer] We both agree: Protests are good. Riots are not. Unpack that for us from your context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esau: There is a cycle of what happens. There’s a racial incident. African Americans protest. Some of those protests from people inside and outside the community turn violent. People say, “Hey, look at this. Why aren’t the Christians who are speaking out against the racial injustice equally strong speaking about the riots?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I commend <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/race-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-one.html">the entire interview series that Ed Stetzer recently did with Esau McCaulley</a>. Among many highlights, I appreciate McCaulley’s following answer to the question of negotiating the differences between protests and riots. Again, <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2020/june/racism-in-america-interview-with-esau-mccaulley-part-four.html">read the whole interview</a> and series, but here’s a key section related to concern about rioting and lawlessness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Ed Stetzer] We both agree: Protests are good. Riots are not. Unpack that for us from your context.</p>
<p>Esau: There is a cycle of what happens. There’s a racial incident. African Americans protest. Some of those protests from people inside and outside the community turn violent. People say, “Hey, look at this. Why aren’t the Christians who are speaking out against the racial injustice equally strong speaking about the riots?”</p>
<p>There are couple of things that I want to say about that. First, there is no real question as to where Christians stand on riots. There isn’t a kind of evangelical pro-riot, black riot faction. Therefore, on one level there is not a need to condemn rioting as a form of social protest, because everybody’s clear about this.</p>
<p>The problem is that the very people who are mad at us for not being strong enough against riots are the same people who say systemic racism isn’t a problem. This only manifests the contradiction.</p>
<p>There is no question we are all opposed to riots. There seems to be a question as to whether or not Christians should speak out against systemic oppression.</p>
<p>There needs to be a public and robust statement that the followers of Jesus are on the side of those who are being unjustly treated.</p>
<p>The second thing that I want to say about that is that if you want to talk to someone who is behaving in a way that is counterproductive, the first thing you need to do is actually show some empathy. If the first thing you do is you come in and say, “Law and order, law and order, law and order,” you’re not understanding the deep sense of frustration.</p>
<p>A riot is the manifestation of hopelessness.</p>
<p>The first thing that I try to do, and you’ve seen many African American leaders do this, is to say, “I get it. You’re frustrated. It seems like these videos will never stop, and this has been going on for years.” Then, once you’ve established that you care, you can begin to push back on the riot themselves.</p>
<p>You can’t come to a community that you hate and then rebuke them for behaving in a way that you don’t find is appropriate. You didn’t care about them anyway.</p>
<p>The only people who have the social and moral standing to speak to a community of unrest is people who at least can begin to understand the cause of that unrest.</p>
<p>As a Christian, I believe that the means and the ends must be one. You can’t have a good end with an improper means. If the end is justice, for the Christian the means themselves have to be just. The Christians who are protesting against systemic oppression, at least those who are biblically faithful, are the ones who are saying, “Ultimately, even if I understand some of the frustration that is going on, these riots are not a Christian means of advocating for social change.”</p>

      <title>Why is the word “systemic” a flashpoint for certain Christians?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/why-is-the-word-systemic-a-flashpoint-for-certain-christians/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 20:13:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/why-is-the-word-systemic-a-flashpoint-for-certain-christians/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the Bible has much to say about &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; sin and redemption. But (1) focusing on “systemic” issues doesn’t need to negate a focus on “individual” issues. In fact, a focus on “systemic racism” actually exerts a lot of pressure to evaluate people individually, and not on the basis of their race—as long as we keep in mind how those supposedly individual evaluations are often subtly (and nefariously) shaped by systemic issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Certainly, the Bible has much to say about <em>individual</em> sin and redemption. But (1) focusing on “systemic” issues doesn’t need to negate a focus on “individual” issues. In fact, a focus on “systemic racism” actually exerts a lot of pressure to evaluate people individually, and not on the basis of their race—as long as we keep in mind how those supposedly individual evaluations are often subtly (and nefariously) shaped by systemic issues.</p>
<p>And, more importantly, (2) the Bible also has a lot to say about structural sin and the communal nature of human life. For example, I’ve been reading through Ezekiel in the Daily Office, and he paints in some <em>really</em> broad brushstrokes when prophetically denouncing people. What about all the “good apples” that he and other prophets overlook? Sure, some of that is down to figures of speech that substitute the part for the whole and vice versa, but some of it is also the biblical truth that our actions have ripple effects in the various communities of which we are a part.</p>
<p>I’ll confess that, when I hear certain critiques of “systemic,” and especially “systemic racism,” those critiques sound like they’re based more upon Enlightenment individualism than they’re based upon the Bible. Now, of course, that doesn’t mean that everyone who speaks of “systemic” issues is speaking biblically!</p>
<p>But why shouldn’t Christians speak about “systemic” issues? It strikes me as unfair to assume that, once the word “systemic” is used, that we’ve abandoned the gospel. After all, “our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” (Eph 6:12). That’s one of the passages that come to mind when I speak against systemic racism.</p>
<p>Another passage that comes to mind is from earlier in the same epistle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>11 So then, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, called “the uncircumcision” by those who are called “the circumcision”—a physical circumcision made in the flesh by human hands— 12 remember that you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us. 15 He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace, 16 and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through it. 17 So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; 18 for through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father. 19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God, 20 built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. 21 In him the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; 22 in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God. (Eph. 2:11–22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If these verses from Paul don’t at least have systemic implications (implications that, to be sure, involve human individuals!), then I don’t know what they’re about.</p>

<p><em>Following the lead of bishops Jim Hobby, Todd Hunter, Stewart Ruch III, and Steve Wood, who</em> <a href="https://adoc.church/a-letter-concerning-the-death-of-george-floyd-and-so-many-others/"><em>recently wrote</em></a> <em>in response to the death of George Floyd, which gained support from a number of other bishops, we offer this open letter to our fellow ACNA clergy and to the churches under our care.

<h2 id="our-context">Our Context</h2>
<p>Our province, The Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), was born as part of a global movement that features diverse leadership and reflects the churches and people of global Anglicanism. It is a manifestation of the universal power and eschatological <em>telos</em> of the Gospel of Jesus: “from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb” (Rev. 7:9).</p>
<p>Currently, the American population is about 38% non-white. By many projections, over the next 20 years, it will be increasingly composed of ethnic minorities. Our province, however, is far from representative of this emerging reality. The mission on our doorstep is clear: to reach North America, in all of its ethnic diversity, “with the transforming love of Jesus Christ.” We have the opportunity to proclaim the Gospel “to the whole creation” (Mark 16:15) and to be Jesus’ witnesses “to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8). We are called to reflect the ethnic diversity of the global movement of which we are a part, as well as the diverse locales in which we are present.</p>
<p>In order to more fully embody our Gospel witness, we must support, encourage, and empower the leadership of brothers and sisters of color in the ACNA to create more hospitable and welcoming spaces for people of color. This includes Black, Latino/a, Native, Asian, and other people groups. We must listen and respond to these voices in our midst and collectively seek to understand and address the historic and ongoing ways in which people of color continue to struggle under various expressions of injustice.</p>
<p>We see and grieve the racism and discrimination that exists and has a deep cultural and structural influence in our society, in our communities, and in our churches. The recent tragedies of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd are simply the latest in a long line of harrowing examples of these deeply embedded systemic realities. We see and grieve that our brothers and sisters of color, including many in our own dioceses and parishes, have been and continue to be profoundly affected by these realities.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, we offer the following confessions and make the following commitments.</p>
<h2 id="confessions">Confessions</h2>
<p>We confess that we have failed to see, understand, and address the expressions of racism, both personal and systemic, that plague our society, communities, and churches.</p>
<p>We confess our slowness to listen to the dismay and discouragement of our brothers and sisters of color, especially those in our own province, and have neglected to cultivate hospitable spaces for them to flourish.</p>
<p>We confess that our ignorance, complacency, and silence have undermined our fidelity to the Great Commandment to love God and love our neighbor (Matt. 22:36-40), which fundamentally calls us into disciplines of anti-racism.</p>
<h2 id="commitments">Commitments</h2>
<p>We commit to listening to, learning from, and supporting leaders of color in their witness to our province.</p>
<p>We commit to partnering with these friends, and with organizations like</p>
<ul>
<li>the<a href="https://anglicanmultiethnic.org/"> Anglican Multiethnic Network (AMEN)</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.caminemos-juntos.com/">Caminemos Juntos</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ammic.ca/">Asian &amp; Multicultural Ministries in Canada</a>, and</li>
<li>the<a href="http://etnn.org/"> Every Tribe and Nation Network</a></li>
</ul>
<p>that are working to promote, support, and invest in a more diverse and just Anglicanism.</p>
<p>And, in all of our different capacities and platforms, in our churches and in the world, we commit ourselves to investing in the work of anti-racism—in our catechesis, discipleship, preaching, ministry, advocacy, and reform.</p>
<p><em>(Editor’s note: You should also check out <a href="https://www.anglicanjusticeandmercy.org/home">the work being done by The Matthew 25 Initiative</a>.)</em></p>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>We are encouraged by the leaders, including the Archbishop, who have spoken out about the recent injustices, and we know that there are places within the province where there is movement toward realizing this vision of a multi-ethnic church, one that is unhindered by racism in all its forms, that can reach the entirety of North America.</p>
<p>However, there is significant work yet to be done. We hope that others will join us in our intentional commitment to partnering with leaders of color and the provincial organizations listed above in order to cultivate a diverse and just Anglicanism in North America.</p>
<p>We are a group of clergy committed to the ACNA and its mission. <a href="#sign">If you would like either to join us in these confessions and commitments or signal your affirmation of such work, we invite you to add your name to this letter.</a></p>
<p>Our ultimate goal, however, is not just signatures, but a collective public commitment towards diversity and justice for the sake of the gospel and our Kingdom witness.</p>
<p><em>Almighty God, you created us in your own image: Grant us grace to contend fearlessly against evil and to make no peace with oppression; and help us to use our freedom rightly in the establishment of justice in our communities and among the nations, to the glory of your holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.</em></p>
<p>Sincerely in Christ,</p>

      <title>Don’t Stir the Pot?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m pondering the “don’t stir the pot” reaction that reliably happens every time we publish something on women’s ordination—most especially anything in &lt;em&gt;favor&lt;/em&gt; of women’s ordination—&lt;a href=&#34;https://anglicancompass.com/&#34;&gt;over at Anglican Compass&lt;/a&gt;, where I’m the Managing Editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: This post is not a subtweet of anyone in particular. It’s just me thinking out loud about a phenomenon that keeps occurring.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every time we post something about women’s ordination, a controversial issue has been whether or not doing so needlessly “stirs the pot,” as in “causes trouble, unrest, dissent.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m pondering the “don’t stir the pot” reaction that reliably happens every time we publish something on women’s ordination—most especially anything in <em>favor</em> of women’s ordination—<a href="https://anglicancompass.com/">over at Anglican Compass</a>, where I’m the Managing Editor.</p>
<p><em>(Note: This post is not a subtweet of anyone in particular. It’s just me thinking out loud about a phenomenon that keeps occurring.)</em></p>
<p>Almost every time we post something about women’s ordination, a controversial issue has been whether or not doing so needlessly “stirs the pot,” as in “causes trouble, unrest, dissent.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, some argue that this issue has already been debated to death. From this perspective, continuing to post about women’s ordination simply exacerbates a condition that would be better off left alone—<a href="https://anglicancompass.com/want-to-learn-more-about-womens-ordination-debates-within-anglicanism-start-with-these-resources/">the “dual integrities” diocesan-level division on women’s ordination that currently characterizes the ACNA.</a>. On the other hand, however, others argue that, since this issue is not settled, it’s perfectly appropriate to blog about this.</p>
<p>The issue, then, is whether or not women’s ordination is worth talking about, at least among Anglicans in public.</p>
<p>My own personal view is that it <em>is</em> worth talking about the Anglican debate over women’s ordination in public. Though I concede that needless provocation (“stirring the pot”) is vicious, I still maintain that there is an important difference between <em>causing</em> or <em>exacerbating</em> a division and <em>describing</em> one.</p>
<p>For example, it would be vicious to take pot shots across the divide and try to get everyone to think either that (1) all egalitarians/mutualists completely ignore Scripture and tradition and choose to follow cultural trends instead, or that (2) all complementarians/hierarchicalists/patriarchalists hate women and want to keep them out of positions of power and influence. This would be “stirring the pot” and exacerbating our divisions.</p>
<p>However, I think it is an importantly different endeavor to try to help people on both sides of the debate see where the others stand. To remind the egalitarians that it’s unfair to say that all complementarians hate women. To remind the complementarians that it’s unfair to say that all egalitarians prioritize cultural trends over Scripture and tradition.</p>
<p>Some might object that giving both sides of the debate airtime means that we’ve abandoned the truth in one direction or the other. But given that this is an important and ongoing division within the ACNA, between conservative and orthodox Christians, this seems like necessary work. It strikes me as unduly tribalistic to either pretend like the other side doesn’t exist, or to condemn anyone who would listen to arguments from the other side as a dangerous traitor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some might object that this work has already been done. By and large, I would agree. But just because almost every facet of the debate has already been covered in various settings—books, articles, etc.—doesn’t mean that we don’t have room to grow in understanding of our differences. There may be nothing new under the sun, and yet we still keep writing and talking about other things. Why not women’s ordination as well?</p>
<p>On the issue of women’s ordination, we obviously disagree with one another—both within the ACNA and within the Anglican Communion. And yet I’m not quite sure that we fully understand one another. From my limited perspective, it’s worth “stirring the pot” until we at least reach full, respectful understanding—even if we never reach full agreement on this side of eternity.</p>

<hr>
<p>Over the past several months, readers of Anglican Compass have engaged with many opinions on <a href="http://anglicancompass.com/tag/womens-ordination/">the topic of women’s ordination</a>. One wonders, given the state of dual integrities within the ACNA and the ever-churning blog debates between our public intellectuals, what is the point of another take on this issue?</p>
<p>But stay with me, friends. At the risk of debate fatigue, I want to stir these waters once more because after reading these pieces, I believe we are missing several key points in the conversation. In fact, I believe we need to engage in a fundamentally different conversation—one that centers the debate in its proper theological home: baptism and the Person of Christ.</p>
<p>Proponents of the male-only priesthood have argued that a literal reading of scripture shows women clearly cannot have priestly authority in the church. They also propound that women’s orders would go against a natural order of male headship, established by God in creation, and perhaps even reflected within God’s trinitarian being. But these arguments redirect the issue away from its true theological foundation and veer into less than orthodox weeds. These are not christological positions and they don’t say much about our identity in Jesus Christ through baptism.</p>
<p>In what follows, I want to discuss how Anglicans have misused both baptism and the literal interpretation of scripture to uphold hierarchical social orders, a pattern of thought that closely mirrors ancient Gnostic exegesis, of which male headship is a prime example.</p>
<p>To counter that, I want to explore the biblical relationship between baptism and priesthood, as outlined in the book of Hebrews. Because Christ is two natures, his priesthood—his mediation—is his person, which has a direct bearing on how we conceive of our own priesthood. We see this clearly evidenced in the martyrdoms of Ignatius of Antioch and Blandina of Lyons, a woman who, as she dies, is depicted <em>in persona Christi</em>.</p>
<p>In their eagerness to support their understanding of tradition, Anglicans have sometimes compromised the Kingdom with cultural values, veering away from a biblical theology of human ordination and missing the reality of baptism. If we are to have a good faith conversation around these issues, this must be addressed. So come, let’s wade in the waters one more time.</p>
<h2 id="claiming-baptism-against-the-bishop">Claiming Baptism Against the Bishop</h2>
<p>In 1723, Edmund Gibson, the Bishop of London and ecclesial authority over England’s colonies, was faced with a crisis. What happens when slaves want to be baptized and taught the faith? The slaveholders, he knew, were adamantly against baptism or education of any kind, fearing it would lead to the slaves’ agitation against their social position. In fact, they were so desperate to prevent this that slaves who learned to read or who taught others to do so were brutally punished and killed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a group of slaves came together and wrote an urgent <a href="http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/_Letter_from_Virginia_Slaves_to_Bishop_Edmund_Gibson_August_4_September_8_1723">entreaty</a> to the Bishop of London:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We your humble and poor parishioners do beg Sir your aid and assistance in this one thing which lies as I do understand in your lordship’s brest which is that your honor will by the help of our suffering lord King George…release us out of this curel bondege and this we beg for Jesus Christ’s sake who has commanded us to seek first the kingdom of God and all things shall be added unto us. And here it is to be noted that one brother is a slave to another and one sister to another…and we are commanded to keep holy the sabbath day and we do hardly know when it comes for our task masters are as hard with us as the Egyptians were with the Children of Israel, God be merciful to us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several things are at play here. First, in an act of cultural rebellion, they learned to read scripture and, more importantly, to read themselves into it theologically. They saw themselves in the enslaved children of Israel and understood that scripture laid out their freedom on the basis of baptism.</p>
<p>Second, they understood that the act of baptism made them parishioners of the church, members of a body which fundamentally changed their previous social relations. The cry of the slaves was that they were under the Bishop’s care and both he and they worshiped the same Lord Jesus Christ. It is a cry of hope and a desire to live in a new relationship of belonging in Christ, to throw off the oppression of evil. One could almost read this as a colonial-era Philemon, if Onesimus had penned the letter instead of Paul.</p>
<p>In that era, Christians could not own other Christians as slaves. Slaves therefore were always defined as idolators, heathens, fundamentally ‘other’. So when these slaves wrote to him <em>as Christians</em>, Bp. Gibson had a pastoral crisis on his hands. It isn’t known whether the Bishop saw this letter, although it was found at Lambeth Palace. But we do have his response in a <a href="http://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/7190370#view">letter</a> circulated to plantation owners where he argues, based on 1 Cor. 7:20, that baptism in no way changes social relationships, but rather will make slaves better slaves because that’s what the New Testament commands—literally (Col. 3:22-23).</p>
<p>The Bishop, torn between his desire to uphold social order and his duty to increase the flock, took hold of his literal reading of St. Paul and attempted a classic Anglican <em>via media</em>: baptism would save the soul of the slave, but leave their body in its pre-established position in the social hierarchy. They would be “saved” in faith, but remain property in body. Slavery, the Bishop and his contemporaries (theologians like Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards) argued, is a cosmic structure, natural and God-ordained (<em>Divided by Faith,</em> Emerson and Smith, pg. 22-26). Salvation was open to all because all were made in God’s image, but it would in no way violate that “natural” created order.</p>
<p>Which of these, do you think, was a better reader of scripture? The one who showed us Christ. The slaves interpreted their lives according to the scriptures, reading after the model of Peter and Paul. God’s word was for them, <em>pro nobis</em>, a Christological reading practice. They read scripture against their culture, against the “natural state of things” and their “place” within it and by doing so understood the logic of baptism. They saw that it was creation anew, that the Old Adam passes away as we are born of Christ, not returning to Eden, but discovering the New Jerusalem, as something neither gnostic nor dualist, but with a claim on real social relations and a claim on those with whom they were baptized: the Bishop, priests, and even their Christian slave owners. They knew that they should be free because they were free together in Christ.</p>
<h2 id="male-headship-as-gnostic-anthropology">Male Headship as Gnostic Anthropology</h2>
<p>What we saw in Bp. Gibson’s response is sadly not a historical outlier. Christianity’s social imagination has often been hijacked to support less than biblical mythologies, especially in how it imagines bodies arranged within hierarchies of power.</p>
<p>As we look back at Bp. Gibson’s verdict, we can see the Gnostic worldview hardly concealed. Gnosticism taught that there were three human essences, each in a role of hierarchy over the next. Of these, it was only the top tier, the ‘spiritual’ humans, who were truly saved. Their redemption narrative grounded this belief in a pre-fall hierarchy of essences and they worked toward a return to that state by ordering and controlling humanity in the present. In Bp. Gibson’s response to the plantation owners, he inhabited this worldview (slavery is a cosmic structure), even while attempting a literal reading and application of the scriptures. Instead of preaching Christ crucified, he unwittingly inhabited Gnostic myth by differentiating African slave essence from European Christian essence and keeping them hierarchically aligned.</p>
<p>In our contemporary moment, I see this same interpretive tendency within the discourse on gender roles. Certain theologians have promoted a concept of male headship that reduces the complex notion of ‘head’ in the ancient world (see Lucy Peppiatt’s <em>Rediscovering Scripture’s Vision for Women</em>) to an authority/submission structure (a meaning taken from ancient military culture, not found in the New Testament). This concept is then grounded univocally in both the Trinity and creation, establishing a hierarchy of essentialized roles between the Father and the Son, and locating this structure for social order in a pre-creation, pre-fall world. Men and women are described as possessing “gifts” or “charisms” that correlate to an essential masculinity or femininity, existing always in a hierarchical relation. Salvation in this worldview means not just putting on Christ, but also putting on your essence as a male or female and accepting your place within the hierarchy God established before the fall.</p>
<p>The end result of this is that the worldview of male headship misappropriates the story of salvation to elevate a particular kind of male essence—one that sees itself as a universal principle, requiring the submission of other essences, whether those be non-white, female, or even land.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would better be named a principality or power.</p>
<p>St. Irenaeus of Lyons refuted this kind of gnostic thinking when he criticized the myth of hierarchies by showing how God’s whole economy of Creation and Redemption centered on the flesh of Christ, who is God’s Image and the true Human Being.</p>
<p>Christ, he reminded the Christians of his day, is the beginning, middle, and goal of creation. In creation, the <em>adam</em> was a type of the one to come, Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:14). Salvation’s goal is not Christ returning us to a pre-fall state, whatever idyllic mythology we project back onto the garden. Salvation is eschatological, the end and the goal, that has appeared in Jesus Christ in the present. We tend to think of salvation as moving from Adam to Christ, who restores what Adam was.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>St. Irenaeus, St. Paul, and the Gospel of John all have it differently: Humanity is re-founded, <em>re-created in Christ</em>. The old (Adam) is passing away, the new (Christ) has come (Col. 1:15-20). To read the Genesis narrative as a description of male/female hierarchy in nature and role is to read it through the lense of our own cultural assumptions. In other words, if we’re not reading Genesis christologically, we’re likely to be reading it Gnostically. You need to know the end, Christ, to understand the beginning, the <em>adam</em>.</p>
<p>It is the person of Christ that stands against any gnostic mythology, any dualism, as the sole essence of creation.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-baptism-makesin-christ-out-of-adam">The Difference Baptism Makes—In Christ, Out of <em>adam</em></h2>
<p>Not only do we fall into Gnostic mythology, but we also miss something fundamental about the incarnation itself if we think first of nature and look to Christ second. His person is <em>two</em> natures, uncreated and created.</p>
<p>He is the God-human.</p>
<p>I say human here purposely. In the New Testament the Greek word <em>‘anthropos’</em> is used of Christ, not the male ‘<em>arsen</em>’ which pairs with <em>‘gune/thelys’</em> female, which can signal gender or wife. This is important because in Christ’s <em>anthropos</em> there is no <em>arsen/thelys</em> (Gal. 3:28). The enmity between male/female in Adam has been reconciled in Christ, which is why Paul says in 2 Cor. 5 that we do not regard anyone according to the flesh, <em>not even Christ</em>. Christ shows us what it means to be human eschatologically, from the completion of creation back into history. Humanity isn’t going back to Eden. And that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>So, then, if we insist that Christians must conform to the pattern of some “natural” state—i.e., the roles of headship/submission—in order to to be fully human, what we’re really doing is rebirthing them into the Old Adam and interposing another mediator between ourselves and Christ. We’re choosing a baptism not into Christ, but into a social order of death.</p>
<p>There is only one head, one source for Christians: the divine-<em>anthropos</em> Jesus Christ. When, as St. Paul says, we were baptized into Christ’s death, our former source in the <em>adam</em> (male/female) of death was ended—thanks be to God—and our new life is only and exclusively the life of the divine-<em>anthropos</em>, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>To state it bluntly, asserting an Adamic male headship is to adhere to Gnostic mythology and to insist on the continuation of male/female as idealized identities based in headship is to get Christ’s work precisely backwards, leaving unreconciled something Christ has fundamentally put to death by his death. He doesn’t perfect the Adamic archetype. He brings it to death and raises himself as the new eschatological Human Being. He has, by the blood of his cross, put to death all divisions caused by the fall, whether male/female, master/slave, Jew/Gentile, and has raised instead the Human Being, who is known and justified by faith. Because Christ is two natures, our baptism into him transfers us out of what we are by nature into what he is in his person: infinite God united to flesh, a new mode of being.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-priesthoodhebrews-and-the-priesthood-of-christ">A New Priesthood—Hebrews and the Priesthood of Christ</h2>
<p>With the acknowledgment of a new mode of being human, we must also ask some fundamental questions about the priesthood itself. Christ’s priesthood, Hebrews tells us, is of the order of Melchizedek. Why then has the church often implemented a version of the Levitical priesthood, when Christ’s priesthood is of a completely different order?</p>
<p>The Levitical priesthood was a caste, males of a specific tribe set apart for Israel’s rituals, whereas the priesthood of Melchizedek was not based on any natural qualities that would group him within a holy caste. “No father, no mother, no genealogy” (Heb 7:3). He is a priest of God not because of his nature, but because of God’s calling.</p>
<p>That is Christ’s priesthood also, not according to any natural qualities (male, female, Jew, Gentile), but by the will of God. This is the priesthood Christ shares with us through baptism and his personal calling, one in which we belong not by nature but by faith in him who called us. Priesthood under the new covenant has also been re-founded, re-created in Christ. Just as there is now one Human Being (<em>anthropos</em>), Jesus Christ, so also there is now only one priest, one mediator, and his priesthood is based in his Person, not in the natural qualities of his divinity or his humanity (although it does not exclude them). It arbitrarily privileges certain human particulars to say the priesthood after Christ is a caste of Christian males, whether ethnically Jewish or Gentile. More seriously, it disregards the reality of the new covenant and mars the priesthood with supersessionism.</p>
<p>If we imagine that Christ’s body, composed of the baptized, must still uphold the regulations of the old covenant, have we really understood baptism in the first place? Or is there an aspect of our Adamic identity we want to preserve from the death of baptism, a toe or heel of maleness kept out of the water, through which we try to be justified by nature? The very thing we withhold from the death of baptism is that which will cause us to stumble, a place where death is still at work.</p>
<p>If we are justified to be priests by our maleness, then we might as well bring back the lambs for slaughter. St. Paul said as much about circumcision. Why is this any different?</p>
<h2 id="she-is-the-form-of-christ">“She is the Form of Christ”</h2>
<p>So what does it mean to be <em>in persona Christi</em>–<em>as</em>–<em>anthropos</em>? What is the Human Being and how do we, as the body of Christ, embody that through baptism?</p>
<p>It is Pilate, ironically, who lifts the curtain for us as he presents the robed and thorn-crowned Jesus to the crowd.“Look at the Human Being,” he declares, or in the Greek “ ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄνθρωπος” (John 19:5). Here is the <em>anthropos</em>, a martyr, in passion and death—which in Christ is life. This is the Imago Dei, the goal into which the male/female <em>adam</em> is called to be recreated.</p>
<p>Christ is the Human Being in the Holy of Holies of his Temple—his body—from which streams of living water flow and of which the church, the new humanity, is born.</p>
<p>It is in the lives of the martyrs that we can see the revealed <em>anthropos</em> most clearly. In his <em>Ecclesial Histories</em>, Eusebius chronicles the story of Blandina, a slave girl from Lyons, France, who is brought to the arena for torture and death. Eusebius recounts the testimonies of several martyrs, but it is that of Blandina that strengthens everyone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blandina, through whom Christ showed that things which appear mean and obscure and despicable to men are with God of great glory … [She]was filled with such power as to be delivered and raised above those who were torturing her by turns from morning till evening in every manner, so that they acknowledged that they were conquered, and could do nothing more to her. And they were astonished at her endurance, as her entire body was mangled and broken; and they testified that one of these forms of torture was sufficient to destroy life, not to speak of so many and so great sufferings.</p>
<p>But the blessed woman, like a noble athlete, renewed her strength in her confession; and her comfort and recreation and relief from the pain of her sufferings was in exclaiming, ‘I am a Christian, and there is nothing vile done by us.’ … [Then she] was suspended on a stake, and exposed to be devoured by the wild beasts who should attack her. <em>And because she appeared as if hanging on a cross, and because of her earnest prayers</em>, she inspired the combatants with great zeal. For they looked on her in her conflict, and beheld with their outward eyes, <em>in the form of their sister, him who was crucified for them</em>, that he might persuade those who believe in him, that every one who suffers for the glory of Christ has fellowship always with the living God.” (emphasis mine).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blandina was a slave. Not only that, she was a female slave, the lowest position in the cultural hierarchy. Her social status bordered on the non-human. And yet, as Eusebius recounts it, truly this woman was <em>in persona Christi</em>.</p>
<p>Her baptized body transgresses every boundary the hierarchy has erected. She is <em>in persona Christi</em> because Christ shares his life with her and co-suffers with her, “not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life” (Heb. 7:16). His indestructible life is her life, her cross is his cross, his communion is the communion she offers by the testimony of her body and blood, which is also the Church’s seed.</p>
<p>Have we grasped the truly sacramental nature of martyrdom, of being the <em>anthropos</em>? Ignatius of Antioch described his imminent death as becoming “the pure bread” of Christ, explaining that he would become the eucharist as the lions ground his body to pieces. “When I shall have arrived [at martyrdom],” Ignatius wrote, “ I will be the Human Being.” Are we able to embrace testimony like that? Like Blandina’s? Or have we lost a vision of the eucharist as a martyric event in which all the baptized share?</p>
<p>If instead our sacramental worldview reduces <em>in persona Christi</em> to necessitating “the male form of Christ,” we are utilizing a docetic form of <em>persona</em>: he seems like Christ, approximates Christ’s form only in maleness. This use of <em>persona</em> is more pagan than its meaning rooted in trinitarian and christological discourse. To be in the person of Christ, to understand the <em>anthropos</em>, look instead to the martyrs. Look to the bodies broken, the blood spilled, the life in death.</p>
<p>It is not Adam (or Eve) at the altar or hanging before the wild animals in the arena. It is Christ the Human Being in the body of Ignatius, in the blood of Blandina.</p>
<p>If women are <em>in persona Christi</em> in the arena, they are <em>in persona Christi</em> at the altar.</p>
<h2 id="what-he-cannot-by-nature-have">“What He Cannot By Nature Have”</h2>
<p>So where does this leave us, then? In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, the preface to Holy Baptism says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin, and that our Savior Christ saith, none can enter into the kingdom of God, except he be regenerate and born anew of Water and of the Holy Ghost: I beseech you to call upon God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous mercy he will grant to <em>this Child</em> that thing which by nature <em>he</em> cannot have; that <em>he</em> may be baptized with Water and the Holy Ghost, and received into Christ’s holy Church, and be made a lively member of the same.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That thing which by nature he cannot have.</p>
<p>We cannot have the life of Christ, much less be priests in Christ’s church, by nature. Stipulating a certain nature to qualify for the priesthood is anti-baptismal. Our calling to be priests exists always within our primary calling to martyrdom, to be the Human Being. As many as have put on Christ in baptism, who are thus becoming the eschatological <em>anthropos</em>, they also can be called to ordination.</p>
<p>Any disagreement among Christians is an opportunity to discern the mind of Christ (Phil 4:1-5). As the debate on ordination continues in our communion, I hope that we will not be satisfied with anything less than the whole Christ. Sadly, Anglicans have a history of adapting to cultural hierarchies, whether that be slavery, gnostic mythologies of gender, or even subordinating the Trinity to a cultural idol of social order. A literal reading of Scripture won’t save us from that theological misdirection.</p>
<p>For that, we need a christological reasoning that re-centers this debate in the life and death of Jesus Christ, the God-human, and the priesthood of his body and blood.</p>
<p>If you are baptized into Christ, you are a new creation and are justified by faith to be a priest following Christ’s priesthood. To quote <a href="http://anglicancompass.com/if-women-can-be-saved-then-women-can-be-priests/">Dr. McGowin’s first piece on Anglican Compass</a>, “by becoming one with Christ in our baptism, all become partakers of his Royal Priesthood.” Because both men and women are called to be Christ’s witnesses, to be the <em>anthropos</em>, they are both called to be <em>in persona Christi</em>, to embody the life of martyrdom, whether in the arena or at the altar.</p>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/balderdash-12-suggestions-for-overcoming-writers-block-from-andrew-t-le-peaus-write-better/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writer’s block sucks. I’m currently facing it with regard to &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/&#34;&gt;my dissertation&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve decided to hit pause on research and writing until I regain access to my library carrell at Wheaton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I’ve come across some helpful advice on overcoming writer’s block in Andrew T. Le Peau’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2ZuTZC3&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writer Better: A Lifelong Editor on Craft, Art, and Spirituality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is &lt;em&gt;filled&lt;/em&gt; with helpful and practical advice on writing, rewriting, publishing, etc. To whet your appetite, I’d like to share some of Le Peau’s tips for conquering writer’s block. These all come from chapter 7, pages. 72–80.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writer’s block sucks. I’m currently facing it with regard to <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">my dissertation</a> and I’ve decided to hit pause on research and writing until I regain access to my library carrell at Wheaton.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I’ve come across some helpful advice on overcoming writer’s block in Andrew T. Le Peau’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZuTZC3"><em>Writer Better: A Lifelong Editor on Craft, Art, and Spirituality</em></a> (affiliate link).</p>
<p>The book is <em>filled</em> with helpful and practical advice on writing, rewriting, publishing, etc. To whet your appetite, I’d like to share some of Le Peau’s tips for conquering writer’s block. These all come from chapter 7, pages. 72–80.</p>
<ol>
<li>Read lots of stuff. Fill up the tank!</li>
<li>Keep an idea file. Gather tidbits whenever and wherever you can.</li>
<li>Take notes on anything and everything.</li>
<li>Copy the greats. Literally. Take out a classic passage and start copying it down verbatim.</li>
<li>Get some rest. Do something different than you normally do.</li>
<li>Play Balderdash. It’s good practice for coming up with words on the spot without overthinking.</li>
<li>Don’t judge yourself just yet. First, write as a “Madman.” Anything goes! Then, go over what you’ve written as an “Architect.” Then, as a “Carpenter.” Finally, as a “Judge.”</li>
<li>Hit pause, especially if writer’s block is due to a life event.</li>
<li>If you are an extrovert, try talking things out with a friend. Then, if the friend is willing to stick around, try writing while they’re still there! (This might have to be adapted via Zoom these days.)</li>
<li>If you’re a detail person, then research the crap out of your topic. Just set a deadline for yourself so you don’t research forever!</li>
<li>If you can’t land the plane, find an accountability partner (“who is not a peer,” Le Peau specifies. “It needs to be someone you respect and will listen to, who has some authority in your life” pg. 79) and set a deadline.</li>
<li>Remember that writing is difficult! You shouldn’t expect good writing to come easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I really need to take Le Peau’s advice when I get back to working on my dissertation after the stay-at-home order is lifted in Illinois! If you find any of these suggestions helpful, or if you work with words in any way, I highly recommend that you read Le Peau’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZuTZC3"><em>Write Better</em></a>!

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/we-switched-anglican-compass-over-from-hostgator-shared-to-bluehost-vps-hosting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of this morning, it looks like everything for &lt;a href=&#34;https://anglicancompass.com/&#34;&gt;Anglican Compass&lt;/a&gt; has been successfully moved over from our HostGator shared hosting to Bluehost VPS hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that this new arrangement works well for us! Although, to be honest, it’s still an open question in my mind whether or not managed WordPress hosting with WPEngine would be a better fit. I just can’t quite tell whether or not it would be worth the extra cost, given our current traffic and budget.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of this morning, it looks like everything for <a href="https://anglicancompass.com/">Anglican Compass</a> has been successfully moved over from our HostGator shared hosting to Bluehost VPS hosting.</p>
<p>I’m hoping that this new arrangement works well for us! Although, to be honest, it’s still an open question in my mind whether or not managed WordPress hosting with WPEngine would be a better fit. I just can’t quite tell whether or not it would be worth the extra cost, given our current traffic and budget.</p>
<p>What I would <em>really</em> love is for someone to sit down with me and give me a consultation on whether or not we’ve got things set up well for the following 3 websites on Bluehost:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://anglicancompass.com/">https://anglicancompass.com/</a> (this is our most important website right now, it gets the most traffic)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.leaderworks.org/">http://www.leaderworks.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://theevergreenproject.org/">https://theevergreenproject.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Until now, I’ve only been involved with the backend of <a href="https://anglicancompass.com/">Anglican Compass</a>, so I’m not really sure of the ins and outs of how the other 2 websites are set up on the backend. But these three projects are going to be associated going forward, and I’d like to make sure that we’re set up for future success as our numbers increase!</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-religion-mean-great-question&#34;&gt;What does “religion” mean? Great question!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/&#34;&gt;my dissertation on Barth, Bonhoeffer, the Bible, and “religion.”&lt;/a&gt; However, getting clear on just what Barth and Bonhoeffer meant by “religion” is a huge challenge.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-does-religion-mean-great-question">What does “religion” mean? Great question!</h2>
<p>I’m writing <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">my dissertation on Barth, Bonhoeffer, the Bible, and “religion.”</a> However, getting clear on just what Barth and Bonhoeffer meant by “religion” is a huge challenge. It’s what I devoted <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/to-be-or-not-to-be-religious-a-clarification-of-karl-barths-and-dietrich-bonhoeffers-divergence-and-convergence-regarding-religion/">my entire writing sample</a> to examining, and I plan to devote an entire chapter of my dissertation to the topic.</p>
<p>Neither Barth nor Bonhoeffer used the word “religion” in the way that we’re prone to use the word in everyday speech today. <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion">According to Merriam-Webster, “religion” means</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the state of a religious (example: a nun in her 20th year of religion)</li>
<li>the service and worship of God or the supernatural</li>
<li>commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance</li>
<li>a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices</li>
<li>(archaic) : scrupulous conformity : CONSCIENTIOUSNESS</li>
<li>a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Donald McKim’s <em>The Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms</em>, “religion” is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A term with a variety of definitions. Religion includes ritual, social, and ethical elements combined with belief in an unseen world and often a deity. Beliefs may be expressed through myths or doctrines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Barth? Religion is idolatrous “unbelief” or “faithlessness” (<em>Unglaube</em> in German). For Bonhoeffer? Well, as Ralf Wüstenberg has noted, Bonhoeffer’s description of “religion” changed over time, but in his <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em>, he described religion in the following ways:</p>
<p>1. Religion emphasizes inwardness.</p>
<p>2. Religion emphasizes conscience.</p>
<p>3. Religion is a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>4. Religion is manipulative and exploitative.</p>
<p>5. Religion minimizes human strength/knowledge/autonomy and instead focuses on human weakness, ignorance, and boundaries/limits/limitations.</p>
<p>6. Religion is metaphysical, otherworldly, and escapist.</p>

<h2 id="128-dietrich-bonhoeffer-on-god-in-a-secular-world">1.28 DIETRICH BONHOEFFER ON GOD IN A SECULAR WORLD</h2>
<p>Now, to get a taste of what I’m working with, I think that the following two passages from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Theology-Reader-Alister-McGrath/dp/1118874382/">Alister McGrath’s <em>The Christian Theology Reader</em> (5th edition)</a> are helpful.</p>
<p>McGrath gives the following prefatory remarks to the Bonhoeffer excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this letter from Tegel prison, in which he was imprisoned during the final stages of the Second World War, the German theologian and pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906–45) spoke of the new challenge to Christianity in a world in which the existence of God is not taken for granted. He identified a central theme of Christianity, which distinguishes it from all other religions, in its focus in the sufferings of God in Christ. Bonhoeffer was one of the most vigorous critics of the idea that human “religiosity” is a point of contact for the gospel. The theme of a suffering God was of major importance to Bonhoeffer, as this passage makes clear. Bonhoeffer was executed at Flossenbürg concentration camp in April 1945. (McGrath, 45)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s the excerpt from Bonhoeffer (PDF).</p>
<div class="wp-block-file">[McGrath\_2017\_Bonhoeffer-on-God-in-a-secular-world](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/McGrath_2017_Bonhoeffer-on-God-in-a-secular-world.pdf)[Download](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/McGrath_2017_Bonhoeffer-on-God-in-a-secular-world.pdf)</div>I’ve drawn the text below from my Logos edition of Bonhoeffer’s works. This is from Bonhoeffer’s letter to Eberhard Bethge on July 16, 1944.
<blockquote>
<p>Now for a few more thoughts on our topic. I’m just working gradually toward the nonreligious interpretation of biblical concepts. I am more able to see what needs to be done than how I can actually do it. Historically there is just one major development leading to the world’s autonomy. In theology it was Lord Herbert of Cherbury who first asserted that reason is sufficient for religious understanding. In moral philosophy Montaigne p 476 and Bodin substitute rules for life for the commandments. In political philosophy Macchiavelli separates politics from general morality and founds the doctrine of reason of state. Later H. Grotius, very different from Macchiavelli in content, but following the same trend toward the autonomy of human society, sets up his natural law as an international law, which is valid etsi deus non daretur, “as if there were no God.” Finally, p 477 the philosophical closing line: on one hand, the deism of Descartes: the world is a mechanism that keeps running by itself without God’s intervention; on the other hand, Spinoza’s pantheism: God is nature. Kant is basically a deist; Fichte and Hegel are pantheists. In every case the autonomy of human beings and the world is the goal of thought. (In the natural sciences this obviously begins with Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno and their—“heretical”—doctrine of the infinity of the universe [der Welt]. The cosmos of antiquity is finite, as is the created world of medieval thought. An infinite universe—however it is conceived—is self-subsisting, “etsi deus non daretur.” However, modern physics now doubts that the universe is infinite, yet without falling back to the earlier notions p 478 of its finitude.) As a working hypothesis for morality, politics, and the natural sciences, God has been overcome and done away with, but also as a working hypothesis for philosophy and religion (Feuerbach!). It is a matter of intellectual integrity to drop this working hypothesis, or eliminate it as far as possible. An edifying scientist, physician, and so forth is a hybrid. So where is any room left for God? Ask those who are anxious, and since they don’t have an answer, they condemn the entire development that has brought them to this impasse. I have already written to you about the various escape routes out of this space that has become too narrow. What could be added to that is the salto mortale back to the Middle Ages. But the medieval principle is heteronomy, in the form of clericalism. The return to that is only a counsel of despair, a sacrifice made only at the cost of intellectual integrity. It’s a dream, to the tune of “Oh, if only I knew the road back, the long road to childhood’s land!” There is no such way—at least not by willfully throwing away one’s inner integrity, but only in the sense of Matt. 18:3, that is, through repentance, through ultimate honesty! And we cannot be honest unless we recognize that we have to live in the world—“etsi deus non daretur.” And this is precisely what we do recognize—before God! God himself compels us to recognize it. Thus our coming of age leads us to a truer recognition of our situation before God. God would have us know that we must live as those who manage their lives without God. The p 479 same God who is with us is the God who forsakes us (Mark 15:34!). The same God who makes us to live in the world without the working hypothesis of God is the God before whom we stand continually. Before God, and with God, we live without God. God consents to be pushed out of the world and onto the cross; God is weak and powerless in the world and in precisely this way, and only so, is at our side and helps us. Matt. 8:17 makes it quite clear that Christ helps us not by virtue of his omnipotence but rather by virtue of his weakness and suffering! This is the crucial distinction between Christianity and all religions. Human religiosity directs people in need to the power of God in the world, God as deus ex machina. The Bible directs people toward the powerlessness and the suffering of God; only the suffering God can help. To this extent, one may say that the previously described development toward the world’s coming of age, which has cleared the way by eliminating a false notion of God, frees us to see the God of the p 480 Bible, who gains ground and power in the world by being powerless. This will probably be the starting point for our “worldly interpretation.” (DBWE 8:475–80)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McGrath then adds the following “comment” to the reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonhoeffer wrote this letter from prison shortly before his execution. The letter deals with the vulnerability of approaches to religion and theology which proceed on the assumption that humanity is intrinsically religious. For Bonhoeffer, the Nazi experience had called that presupposition into question.</p>
<p>The letter deals extensively with the issue of the autonomy of the world, and the apparent powerlessness of God, which Bonhoeffer regarded as exhibited on the cross. Bonhoeffer’s brief account of intellectual history since the Middle Ages is concerned to bring out how the world has come of age and lives as if there were no God.</p>
<p>Note that the German song title referred to in the text is to be translated as “If only I knew the way back, the long way to the land of childhood.” The Latin slogan <em>etsi Deus non daretur</em> (“as if God is not given”) was used by the Dutch writer Hugo Grotius (1583–1645) and is widely seen as marking a recognition of the growing importance of secular trends in the west.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="94-karl-barth-on-christianity-and-religion">9.4 KARL BARTH ON CHRISTIANITY AND RELIGION</h2>
<p>Here’s McGrath’s prefatory remarks for the Barth passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Swiss Protestant theologian Karl Barth (1886–1968) developed a distinction between “religion” and “revelation,” arguing that the former is a human attempt at self-justification and the latter is God’s contradiction of human preconceptions about God through divine grace. Barth argues that Christianity loses sight of its distinctive identity if it allows itself to become a “religion,” which Barth interprets as a human construction. (McGrath, 496)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s the excerpt(s) from Barth (PDF).</p>
<div class="wp-block-file">[McGrath\_2017\_Barth-on-Religion](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/McGrath_2017_Barth-on-Religion.pdf)[Download](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/McGrath_2017_Barth-on-Religion.pdf)</div>I’ve drawn the text below from my Logos edition of Barth’s *Church Dogmatics*. These passages come from §17, “The Revelation of God as the *Aufhebung* (traditionally translated “abolition”) of Religion.” It might be helpful to note that the *Leitsatz* (the thesis statement, if you will) for this section reads: “The revelation of God in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is the judging but also reconciling presence of God in the world of human religion, that is, in the realm of man’s attempts to justify and to sanctify himself before a capricious and arbitrary picture of God. The Church is the locus of true religion, so far as through grace it lives by grace.”
<p>OK, here’s Barth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A theological evaluation of religion and religions must be characterised primarily by the great cautiousness and charity of its assessment and judgments. It will observe and understand and take man in all seriousness as the subject of religion. But it will not be man apart from God, in a human per se. It will be man for whom (whether he knows it or not) Jesus Christ was born, died and rose again. It will be man who (whether he has already heard it or not) is intended in the Word of God. It will be man who (whether he is aware of it or not) has in Christ his Lord. It will always understand religion as a vital utterance and activity of this man. It will not ascribe to this p 298 life-utterance and activity of his a unique “nature,” the so-called “nature of religion,” (CD I/2, 297–98)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation singles out the Church as the locus of true religion. But this does not mean that the Christian religion as such is the fulfilled nature of human religion. It does not mean that the Christian religion is the true religion, fundamentally superior to all other religions. We can never stress too much the connexion between the truth of the Christian religion and the grace of revelation. We have to give particular emphasis to the fact that through grace the Church lives by grace, and to that extent it is the locus of true religion. And if this is so, the Church will as little boast of its “nature,” i.e., the perfection in which it fulfils the “nature” of religion, as it can attribute that nature to other religions. We cannot differentiate and separate the Church from other religions on the basis of a general concept of the nature of religion. (CD I/2, 298)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We begin by stating that religion is unbelief. It is a concern, p 300 indeed, we must say that it is the one great concern, of godless man. (CD I/2, 299–300)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where we want what is wanted in religion, i.e., justification and sanctification as our own work, we do not find ourselves—and it does not matter whether the thought and representation of God has a primary or only a secondary importance—on the direct way to God, who can then bring us to our goal at some higher stage on the way. On the contrary, we lock the door against God, we alienate ourselves from Him, we come into direct opposition to Him. God in His revelation will not allow man to try to come to terms with life, to justify and sanctify himself. God in His revelation, God in Jesus Christ, is the One who takes on Himself the sin of the world, who wills that all our care should be cast upon Him, because He careth for us. (CD I/2, 309)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Religion is never true in itself and as such. The revelation of God denies that any religion is true, i.e., that it is in truth the knowledge and worship of God and the reconciliation of man with God. For as the self-offering and self-manifestation of God, as the work of peace which God Himself has concluded between Himself and man, revelation is the truth beside which there is no other truth, over against which there is only lying and wrong. If by the concept of a “true religion” we mean truth which belongs to religion in itself and as such, it is just as unattainable as a “good man,” if by goodness we mean something which man can achieve on his own initiative. No religion is true. It can only become true, i.e., according to that which it purports to be and for which it is upheld. And it can become true only in the way in which man is justified, from without; i.e., not of its own nature and being, but only in virtue of a reckoning and adopting and separating which are foreign to its own nature and being, p 326 which are quite inconceivable from its own standpoint, which come to it quite apart from any qualifications or merits. Like justified man, religion is a creature of grace. But grace is the revelation of God. No religion can stand before it as true religion. No man is righteous in its presence. It subjects us all to the judgment of death. But it can also call dead men to life and sinners to repentance. And similarly in the wider sphere where it shows all religion to be false it can also create true religion. The abolishing of religion by revelation need not mean only its negation: the judgment that religion is unbelief. Religion can just as well be exalted in revelation, even though the judgment still stands. It can be upheld by it and concealed in it. It can be justified by it, and—we must at once add—sanctified. Revelation can adopt religion and mark it off as true religion. And it not only can. How do we come to assert that it can, if it has not already done so? There is a true religion: just as there are justified sinners. If we abide strictly by that analogy—and we are dealing not merely with an analogy, but in a comprehensive sense with the thing itself—we need have no hesitation in saying that the Christian religion is the true religion. (CD I/2, 325–26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s McGrath’s “comment”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barth here takes a principled stand against the notion of “religion” as a human construction, rather than a datum of divine revelation. He insists that “religion” will continue until the end of time, as a necessary prop or support to faith. Barth’s concern here is to emphasize that, by the grace of God, this “religion” is transcended and surpassed by God. It is something neutral, not negative. Barth uses the German word <em>Aufhebung</em>, here translated as “abolition.” Yet this German term has a deeper sense, and could be understood to mean the “transformation” or even “sublimation” of religion. Religion, seen as a human construction and contrasted with divine revelation, certainly needs to be critiqued – yet Barth insists that it serves a useful role. (McGrath, 498)</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to parse out the relevance of Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s engagement with Scripture for making sense of the “Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship.” Specifically, I’m trying to, at the very least, add some biblical content and context to the ongoing debate over the relationship between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I put it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/&#34;&gt;the “elevator pitch” for my dissertation proposal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Bonhoeffer in prison, after adopting Barth’s theological critique of religion as idolatrous unbelief…&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m trying to parse out the relevance of Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s engagement with Scripture for making sense of the “Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship.” Specifically, I’m trying to, at the very least, add some biblical content and context to the ongoing debate over the relationship between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion.</p>
<p>As I put it in <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">the “elevator pitch” for my dissertation proposal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does Bonhoeffer in prison, after adopting Barth’s theological critique of religion as idolatrous unbelief…</p>
<p>Why does Bonhoeffer, after claiming that the critique of religion was Barth’s greatest merit and original contribution as a theologian…</p>
<p>Why does Bonhoeffer say that Barth left us with nothing more than a “positivism of revelation” — a flattening of doctrines to the same relative importance, as a result of which the world is left to its own devices — whatever that means!</p>
<p>Why does Bonhoeffer then speak approvingly of a “religionless Christianity,” something that Barth explicitly refused to support?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to answer these questions (or at least move toward an answer), I’ve spent a considerable amount of time looking for specific biblical passages that (1) both Barth and Bonhoeffer discussed (2) at least thematically in relation to their theological critiques of religion. Genesis 1–3 and Matthew 5–7 (the Sermon on the Mount) have emerged as the most relevant passages in this regard.</p>
<p>However, there’s also the question of method and how Barth and Bonhoeffer “dogmatically located” Scripture. Consider what John Webster had to say about Barth, Bonhoeffer, the Bible, and the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My suggestion here, however, is that rather than pursuing questions about positivism of revelation or about the worldly and ethical, light can be shed on the relation of Bonhoeffer and Barth by looking at the place of the interpretation of Scripture in their respective theologies. Both give a thoroughly theological depiction of reading Scripture, that is, a depiction in which language about God is direct and operative; both, therefore, define the human act of interpretation as radical attentiveness and self-relinquishment to God’s saving self-communication through the instrumentality of Holy Scripture. This, I suggest, is one of the points at which these two church theologians come very close to each other, and offer much food for thought to church and theology now. (Webster, Word and Church: Essays in Christian Dogmatics, 88–89).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, although Jameson Ross (in his 2019 Durham PhD dissertation, “Bonhoeffer’s Ecclesial Hermeneutic: The Practice of Biblical Interpretation in 1930s Germany”) has demonstrated much more <em>continuity</em> in Bonhoeffer’s biblical interpretation (specifically, between Bonhoeffer’s 1925 student paper on “The Historical and Pneumatological Interpretation of Scripture” and his 1935 “Contemporizing New Testament Texts”) than Webster saw, I believe that Webster was right to emphasize the following about Bonhoeffer’s biblical work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direct, homiletical rhetoric, the deliberate avoidance of technicality or complexity, the prose stripped to the basics, are all tokens of the fact that Bonhoeffer has come round to an understanding of the task of interpreting Scripture which is governed by two convictions: that Holy Scripture is the <em>viva vox Dei</em>, and that this living voice demands an attitude of ready submission and active compliance. These two convictions are remarkably similar to what Barth himself discovered in the heritage of Reformed Christianity, and they can now be traced in Bonhoeffer (Webster, Word and Church, 101).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Webster applies this to Bonhoeffer’s post-<em>Creation and Fall</em> biblical work, but I would, following Jameson Ross’s dissertation, apply it to <em>Creation and Fall</em> as well.</p>
<p>This directness—or “exegetical immediacy,” as I’ve taken to calling it—is, I believe, a distinguishing feature of Bonhoeffer’s exegesis. Sure, he may have gotten some of it from Barth’s trailblazing work in the area of theological exegesis. But I think that Bonhoeffer is even more comfortable with exegetical immediacy than Barth.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to <em>Creation and Fall</em>, Bonhoeffer is comfortable with making direct moves from Eden to today. Barth, on the other hand, only wants to move from Eden to Israel to Jesus to the Church to today. Barth is, in other words, more attentive to the contours of salvation history, as it were, than Bonhoeffer is—at least when it comes to the passages regarding Genesis 1–3 and Matthew 5–7 that I’ve looked at.</p>
<p>For this reason, I’m not sure I agree with the assessment of Michael Mawson in his essay on “Scripture” in <em>The Oxford Handbook of Dietrich Bonhoeffer</em>. Commenting on Bonhoeffer’s 1925 student paper on scriptural interpretation, Mawson writes that “Bonhoeffer’s early essay is perhaps best read as an enthusiastic endorsement of and expansion on this key Barthian claim” (that the Bible tells us what God says to us, not what humans have said about God, pg. 125). However, Mawson then stresses the influence of Luther:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, while Barth may have provided the proximate impetus for Bonhoeffer’s way of approaching Scripture, this early essay also displays the formative influence of Luther. Even more so than Barth, references to Luther abound in Bonhoeffer’s scriptural engagements and theology, here and elsewhere (cf. Krötke, 2008: 57–60). Luther’s influence is especially evident in Bonhoeffer’s deep insistence on the historicity (Geschichtlichkeit) of the Bible and the hiddenness of God’s word in these human words and texts (cf. DBWE 9: 293–4). (Pg. 125)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t doubt or quibble with Luther’s influence on Bonhoeffer, but I wonder if this is the best way of stating the Luther-vs-Barth difference. It seems to me that Barth only becomes more and more concerned with the historicity of the Bible, at least when it comes to the contours of the covenant between God and humanity in Christ. On the other hand, Bonhoeffer appears to become less concerned with the historical contours <em>within</em> Scripture, and more concerned with present day history and what the Word of God has to say.</p>
<p>Another way that I’m thinking about this is as follows. At least one part of Bonhoeffer’s accusation of Barth’s <em>Offenbarungspositivismus</em> (in the prison letters) is that Barth flattens various doctrines to the same level of significance. Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barth was the first theologian—to his great and lasting credit—to begin the critique of religion, but he then put in its place a positivist doctrine of revelation that says, in effect, “like it or lump it.” <strong>Whether it’s the virgin birth, the Trinity, or anything else, all are equally significant and necessary parts of the whole, which must be swallowed whole or not at all. That’s not biblical. There are degrees of cognition and degrees of significance.</strong> That means an “arcane discipline” must be reestablished, through which the mysteries of the Christian faith are sheltered against profanation. (DBWE 8:373, my emphasis).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Bonhoeffer accuses Barth of flattening out the contours of various levels of doctrinal significance, I wonder if Barth could charge Bonhoeffer with flattening out the contours of salvation history and moving from texts to the present day too quickly, without taking the intervening history of Israel and/or the Church into account.</p>
<p>To be sure, Bonhoeffer does <em>not</em> do this on the basis of extrapolating universal principles from Scripture in order to move from the historical text to the present. In his 1935 lecture on “con temporizing New Testament texts,” Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Contemporizing comes about not through the selection of certain texts but by making the whole of Holy Scripture audible as a witness to the word of God.</em> The only method of contemporization is thus the substantive textual exposition [of the Holy Scriptures] as the witness of Christ, and such exegesis has the promise of Christ’s presence. (DBWE 14:421–422).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bonhoeffer takes a Lutheran “was Christum treibet” approach to the Bible. This is not to say that Barth’s handling of Scripture isn’t also Christological! But it does seem to me that, when commenting upon a passage of Scripture, especially one in the Old Testament, Bonhoeffer wants to get to Christ more quickly and directly than Barth.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s just the global COVID–19 pandemic, but I’ve been really discouraged about my dissertation lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My normal reading/writing workflow has ground to a halt because (1) we are temporarily without childcare and (2) my wife, a Family Nurse Practitioner is still working full-time from the office. That leaves me home alone with our 1.5-year-old during the week and, while she is a &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; child, she’s not really jazzed about dad sitting quietly in a corner getting some reading and writing done during the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps it’s just the global COVID–19 pandemic, but I’ve been really discouraged about my dissertation lately.</p>
<p>My normal reading/writing workflow has ground to a halt because (1) we are temporarily without childcare and (2) my wife, a Family Nurse Practitioner is still working full-time from the office. That leaves me home alone with our 1.5-year-old during the week and, while she is a <em>wonderful</em> child, she’s not really jazzed about dad sitting quietly in a corner getting some reading and writing done during the day.</p>
<p>Right before the pandemic hit, I was able to quickly work my way through the rest of Barth’s as-yet-unpublished 1933–34 lectures on the Sermon on the Mount (<em>Erklärung der Bergpredigt</em>, over 100 pages of type-script lectures that I was able to obtain via PDF from the Karl Barth Archiv in Basel). I was really hoping to find some kind of smoking gun that would (1) clearly display an exegetical difference between Barth and Bonhoeffer and (2) help to explain the ostensible differences between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion.</p>
<p>However, unless I missed something (which, let’s be honest, is possible—I need to work my way through these lectures again because they’re so important), there’s no smoking gun in the 1933–34 lectures. Barth and Bonhoeffer are definitely in the same camp of interpreters of the Sermon on the Mount. There might be slight differences, especially of emphasis, between them—but I didn’t encounter anything <em>major</em> in Barth’s lectures.</p>
<p>This was a serious blow to my motivation and morale. I was considering quitting the project, daydreaming about Wheaton having to shut down the program due to the pandemic, etc. Although I’ve decided to stick with it, I still am getting tired of searching for a “smoking gun” discussion of a biblical passage in Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s writings. And I honestly think that both Barth and Bonhoeffer would find my dissertation—at least in its more historical sections, which have taken up almost all of my time for the past 3 years—a colossal waste of time. I’m quite sure that both of them would prefer that I spend my time reading the Bible closely instead of reading them so closely.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although I’m still down in the dumps about this whole process, I’ve got some things on my mind that I will keep chipping away at.</p>
<p>First, I’m convinced that, because they meant different things by the word “religion” (at least when you compare Barth with Bonhoeffer’s prison letters), Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion are complementary. Ralf Wüstenberg has shown that Bonhoeffer’s definition/description of “religion” shifted at least twice in his life, and what Bonhoeffer calls “religion” in prison is something different than what he called “religion” earlier (and what Barth called “religion” across his career).</p>
<p>Second, I’m convinced that there are important links between (1) Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religions and (2) their theological interpretations of Genesis 1–3. Furthermore, Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s interpretation of “the knowledge of good and evil” differ in the same ways that their theological critiques of religion differ. Now, because Bonhoeffer doesn’t cite/discuss Genesis 1–3 in his theological critique of religion in Letters and Papers from Prison, it strikes me as impossible to prove that Barth and Bonhoeffer’s differences on the knowledge of good and evil in Genesis 1–3 <em>caused</em> their divergences on “religion.” Nevertheless, both Barth and Bonhoeffer critique the knowledge of good and evil in the same kinds of different-yet-complementary ways that they critique “religion,” and I think that’s significant.</p>
<p>Third, given how both Barth and Bonhoeffer use the knowledge of good and evil to critique general and even Christian approaches to ethics, there’s <em>something</em> going on between their theological critiques of religion and their theological critiques of ethics. Exactly <em>what</em> is going on is what I’m currently trying to figure out! I’ve been taking a closer look at their theological interpretations of the Sermon on the Mount and, while I haven’t been able to find a super significant exegetical difference between the two theologians when it comes to Matthew 5–7, I think that Barth is more nervous than Bonhoeffer about (1) ignoring the contours of the history of the covenant between God and humans and (2) implying that humans have the knowledge of good and evil such that they can answer the question “what should we do?” with the text of the Sermon apart from a fresh revelatory work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Both Barth and Bonhoeffer are against doing ethics on the basis of universal ethical principles. They are both intensely skeptical about the ability of humans to know and do the good apart from divine revelation. But Bonhoeffer seems more comfortable (than Barth) with saying that we can read the Sermon on the Mount today and move immediately from what Jesus says in Matthew 5–7 to what we should do. He displays a similar “exegetical immediacy” with regards to Genesis 1–3. Bonhoeffer is comfortable moving directly from Eden to the Church today. Barth, on the other hand, emphasizes that the correct movement is from Genesis 1–3 to Israel, to Jesus, to the Church today.</p>
<p>What do Barth and Bonhoeffer’s differences on (1) the knowledge of good and evil and (2) “exegetical immediacy” (that’s the best descriptor I’ve been able to come up with for now) have to do with their ostensible differences when it comes to (3) the theological critique of religion? That’s what I’m trying to think through in order to tie this project together and take advantage of the reading and research I’ve done so far.</p>
<p>So, in addition to focusing on the Genesis 1–3 texts and the Sermon on the Mount texts in Barth and Bonhoeffer, I’m going to revisit their theological critique of religion texts to see if I can figure out how to tie the various pieces of this project together even if I haven’t been able to find the “smoking gun” passage(s) I was hoping for. It’s been awhile since I started this project with a detailed analysis of texts like chapter 7 of Barth’s Romans commentary, §17 of Barth’s Church Dogmatics, and the “theological letters” in Bonhoeffer’s Letters and Papers from Prison. I’m hoping that, after spending so much time slogging through stuff about Genesis 1–3 and Matthew 5–7, revisiting Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critique of religion texts will help to advance my thinking.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m still very much in the weeds, taking a closer look at how Bonhoeffer and Barth read the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of the Sermon on Mount for Bonhoeffer’s life and work, I’m persuaded that there’s something important to be found here—something that will hopefully shed some light on the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship re:their theological critiques of religion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m still very much in the weeds, taking a closer look at how Bonhoeffer and Barth read the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<p>Given the importance of the Sermon on Mount for Bonhoeffer’s life and work, I’m persuaded that there’s something important to be found here—something that will hopefully shed some light on the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship re:their theological critiques of religion.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are at least two other tidbits that have me interested in how Barth and Bonhoeffer read the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<p><a href="https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/read-the-letter-dietrich-bonhoeffer-wrote-to-gandhi/">On October 17, 1934, Bonhoeffer wrote to Gandhi,</a> inquiring about the possibility of going to India in order to learn how to develop “a truly spiritual living Christian peace movement.” In that letter, Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are having great theologians in Germany—the greatest of them being in my opinion Karl Barth, whose disciple and friend I am happy to be—they are teaching us the great theological thoughts of the Reformation anew, but there is no-one to show us the way towards a new Christian life in uncompromising accordance with the Sermon on the Mount. It is in this respect that I am looking up to you for help.</p>
<p><cite>Bonhoeffer to Gandhi, October 17, 1934</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 19, 1936, Bonhoeffer wrote the following to Karl Barth. He is commenting on their lack of communication since the fall of 1933.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are all sorts of reasons that I have not written since then. I always thought that if I were to write you, I would have to have something reasonable to say, but something reasonable in that sense was precisely what I never had, at least not such that I thought I might take up your time. And I still do not have that today. Besides, <strong>I also wanted to arrive at a certain point on my own with regard to the particular questions that emerged for me from Scripture and which constantly occupied me at the time; in the process I quite frankly repeatedly discovered that in several points I was probably moving away from what you yourself think about these questions. Basically the entire period was an ongoing, silent dispute with you, which is why I had to remain silent for a while. Primarily it involved questions concerning the interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount and the Pauline doctrine of justification and sanctification.</strong> I am currently working on this material and would very much have liked to ask you and hear your views on so many things.</p>
<p><cite>Bonhoeffer to Barth, September 19, 1936 (DBWE 14:252-253), <strong>emphasis added</strong>.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what’s really intriguing to me is *why* Bonhoeffer would think, in 1934–36, that Barth’s interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount was insufficient. Was this just a general sense, based upon familiarity with Barth’s theology? Or did Bonhoeffer have some particular Barthian exegesis in mind?</p>

      <title>Help! I&#39;m looking for examples of &#34;theological triage,&#34; &#34;doctrinal taxonomy,&#34; or &#34;dogmatic rank&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a research project, I’m looking for examples of the reasoning that goes into what’s been called, among other things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“theological triage,”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“doctrinal taxonomy,” or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“dogmatic rank.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m referring to the process of distinguishing between various levels of importance when it comes to theological statements/positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, the Trinity would usually be considered a “first-order” or “primary” doctrine—a “dogma,” if you will. But a specific view of the end times would usually be considered a “second-order,” “secondary,” or “tertiary” doctrine—AKA “adiaphora.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<hr>
<h2 id="john-calvin-institutes-3197">John Calvin, <em>Institutes</em>, 3.19.7</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Freedom in “things indifferent” with proofs from Romans, 7–9</em></p>
<p>7. The third part of Christian freedom lies in this: regarding outward things that are of themselves “indifferent,” we are not bound before God by any religious obligation preventing us from sometimes using them and other times not using them, indifferently. And the knowledge of this freedom is very necessary for us, for if it is lacking, our consciences will have no repose and there will be no end to superstitions. Today we seem to many to be unreasonable because we stir up discussion over the unrestricted eating of meat, use of holidays and of vestments, and such things, which seem to them vain frivolities.</p>
<p>But these matters are more important than is commonly believed. For when consciences once ensnare themselves, they enter a long and inextricable maze, not easy to get out of. . . . (Calvin illustrates the downward spiral of conscience that can occur.)</p>
<p>Here begins a weighty controversy, for what is in debate is whether God, whose will ought to precede all our plans and actions, wishes us to use these things or those. As a consequence, some, in despair, are of necessity cast into a pit of confusion; others, despising God and abandoning fear of him, must make their own way in destruction, where they have none ready-made. For all those entangled in such doubts, wherever they turn, see offense of conscience everywhere present.</p>

<ul>
<li>Notes 1 Cor. 6:9–10 and Rom. 14:5–6 as scriptural support for every generation’s need “to decide just what beliefs and behavior are morally mandated of all believers, and what beliefs and behavior may be left to the individual believer’s conscience” (383).</li>
<li>“The matters where Christians may safely agree to disagree have traditionally been labeled <em>adiaphora</em>, ‘indifferent things’” (383). Yet, because <em>adiaphora</em> are not unimportant, Carson prefers “disputable matters” to “indifferent matters.”</li>
<li>Some decisions, like the resurrection of Jesus Christ being essential, are easy. Other decisions are more complicated. Carson notes “that some things that were thought theologically indisputable in the past have become disputable” (383). Culture and history can/do play a role.</li>
<li>Carson notes the contemporary debate over homosexuality as an example of the <em>adiaphora</em> question’s relevance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="he-provides-ten-reflections-on-what-does-and-does-not-constitute-a-theologically-disputable-matter-384">He provides “ten reflections on what does and does not constitute a theologically disputable matter” (384).</h3>
<ol>
<li>“That something is disputed does not make it theologically disputable, i.e., part of the <em>adiaphora</em>.” (384).</li>
<li>“What places something in the indisputable column, then, is not whether or not it is disputed by some people, or has ever been disputed, but what the Scriptures consistently say about the topic, and how the Scriptures tie it to other matters. At the end of the day that turns on sober, even-handed, reverent exegesis—as Athanasius understood in his day on a different topic.” (384).</li>
<li>“My third, fourth, and fifth observations about disputable matters arise from a close reading of 1 Corinthians 8:1-11:1. In 1 Corinthians 8, Paul does not assert that Christians should not eat meat that has been offered to idols. . . . Nevertheless, Christians with a “weak” conscience . . . must <em>not</em> eat such meat, lest they do damage to their conscience. Eating the meat that has been offered to idols is not intrinsically wrong, but violating one’s own conscience is wrong.” (385).</li>
<li>“an action belonging in the disputable column is not necessarily one that Christians are free to take up. Rather, Christians may rule the action out of bounds either because they admit they have weak consciences, or, knowing their consciences are strong, because they voluntarily put the action aside out of love for weaker believers.” (385).</li>
<li>“actions that may belong to the <em>adiaphora</em>, i.e., that are rightly judged disputable, may in certain cultural contexts become absolutely condemned, thus now belonging in the indisputable column. More briefly: in the right context, what belongs in the disputable column gets shifted to the indisputably bad column.” (386). Illustrates this with the odd apparent contrast between what Paul has to say in 1 Cor. 8 and 1 Cor. 10:14–22.</li>
<li>“Sometimes the theological associations of an action, in a particular context, establish whether an action is right or wrong. In one context, it may be absolutely right or wrong, and thus belong in the indisputable column; in another context, the action may belong to the <em>adiaphora</em>.” (386). Illustrates this with Titus (Gal. 2:1-5) and Timothy (Acts 16:3) re: circumcision.</li>
<li>“Under the new covenant, there is a deep suspicion of those who, for the sake of greater spirituality or deeper purity, elevate celibacy or who prohibit certain foods or who inject merely human (i.e., biblically unwarranted) commands, or who scrap over minor points (e.g., Mark 7:19; 1 Tim 4:3-4; 1:6; 2 Tim 2:14, 16-17; Tit 1:10-16; cf. Rom 14). Such people try to elevate matters that should never be placed in the indisputable column to a high place in the hierarchy of virtues.” (387).</li>
<li>Has moral law been relativized into the disputable column? Carson notes that some make argument from Rom. 14:5–6 relativizing observance of days → Sabbath → Decalogue → moral law. Carson admits that the issues are complicated here, but he provides a few ways of salvaging Sabbath, Decalogue, and moral law from Rom. 14:5–6. He also thinks that homosexuality is different, since “in the Bible there is no text whatsoever that hints that homosexual marriage might in some cases be acceptable.” (387).</li>
<li>Re: William Webb’s <em>Slaves, Women, and Homosexuals</em> and the redemptive movement hermeneutic, Carson points out that Webb himself clarifies why it doesn’t apply to homosexuality. But Carson agrees with Grudem’s critique of Webb. We must follow the trajectories <em>within</em> the Scriptures, “but that does not justify treating the trajectories <em>beyond</em> the Scriptures as normative, the more so when such trajectories undermine what the Scriptures actually say” (388).</li>
<li>Instead of asking questions in the sense of “What are we allowed to do? What can we get away with?,” we should be asking “What will bring glory to God?” (388).</li>

<h3 id="regarding-dogmatic-rank">Regarding “Dogmatic Rank”:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Reformation and post-Reformation scholars, theologians, and pastors delineated dogmatic rank in three ways, in order of importance. The first, the fundamental articles of faith or doctrine,[2] focused on “the basic doctrines necessary to the Christian faith [which] are distinguished from secondary or logically derivative doctrines.” These are the “doctrines without which Christianity cannot exist and the integrity of which is necessary to the preservation of the faith.”</p>
<p>The second, the secondary fundamental articles, recognizes that some of the fundamental articles “such as those concerned with baptism and the Lord’s Supper, might be lacking in a person’s faith, or at least lacking in correct definition, and that person still be saved in the promises of the gospel, since forgiveness of sins rests on faith in Christ, as witnessed in the Word, and not on acceptance of the doctrines of baptism and the Lord’s Supper.” Despite these differences and divides, the conclusion was that adherents of the other view were “Christian and participated in the promise of salvation in Christ because of their acceptance of the primary fundamental doctrines of the person and work of Christ,” even though they voiced concern that the other person’s doctrinal system was considered endangered.</p>
<p>The third, the nonfundamental articles, focuses on “articles the denial of which does not endanger salvation since they are not fundamental to the maintenance of Christian truth and are not concerned with the objects of faith,” e.g., identity of the Antichrist and the nature of angels. “Such doctrines, nonetheless, are scriptural and, therefore, if rightly stated, edifying.”[3]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here, the EFCA document has a couple of helpful footnotes:</p>
<p>FN2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Protestant Scholastic Reformers referred to these three levels of dogmatic rank in the following way: <em>articuli fundamentals</em>, the fundamental articles of faith or doctrine, the <em>articuli fundamentals secundarii</em>, the secondary fundamental articles, and the <em>articuli non-fundamentales</em>, the nonfundamental articles.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FN3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cf. Richard A. Muller, <em>Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology</em>, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2017), 40-41.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, in FN4, they list some examples of doctrinal taxonomy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For a few examples of others who have provided helpful means of determining dogmatic rank, cf. R. Albert <strong>Mohler</strong> Jr., “A Call for Theological Triage and Christian Maturity.” See also the excellent treatment by Erik <strong>Thoennes</strong>, <em>Life’s Biggest Questions: What the Bible Says About the Things That Matter Most</em> (Wheaton: Crossway, 2011), “Essential vs. Peripheral Doctrine,” 35-37. Mohler’s “theological triage” is probably the most widely known, but Thoennes’ taxonomy is likely the most helpful. Finally, Gavin <strong>Ortlund</strong> has written an exceptional book, <em>Finding the Right Hills to Die On: The Case for Theological Triage</em> (forthcoming).”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="regarding-the-efca">Regarding the EFCA:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With the Bible and the gospel foundational to our doctrine and life (1 Tim. 4:16), we have identified four categories of dogmatic rank, which is the notion that not all doctrinal claims stand on the same level:</p>
<p>1. Of First Importance<br>
2. Of Second Importance<br>
3. Of Third Importance<br>
4. Disputable Matters</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>We have also developed a taxonomy/grid by which we determine this rank, the category in which a certain doctrinal issue most appropriately fits.</p>
<p>1. <em>Relevance to our understanding of the nature and character of God</em>: To what extent does this doctrine or practice reveal the person and nature of God?<br>
2. <em>Connection to the gospel and the overarching narrative of the Bible</em>: How directly is this doctrine or practice connected to the gospel and to the storyline of the whole Bible?<br>
3. <em>Exegetical clarity</em>: To what extent does Scripture unambiguously affirm this doctrine or practice?<br>

<li>The chapter is titled “Theology’s Tasks &amp; Traditions.” The section is titled “Theology’s Critical Task.”</li>
<li>“Theology’s critical task is to examine beliefs and teachings about God, ourselves and the world in light of Christian sources, especially the primary norm of the biblical message” (70).</li>
<li>After a belief is determined to be valid, then we categorize it based upon relative importance.</li>
<li>“Over the centuries theologians have developed three main categories of Christian beliefs: <em>dogma</em>, <em>doctrine</em>, and <em>opinion</em>.
<ul>
<li>“A belief is considered a <strong>dogma</strong> if it seems essential to the gospel. In other words, if its denial would seem to entail <em>apostasy</em>—rejection of the gospel of Jesus Christ—then it is a dogma.</li>
<li>“A <strong>doctrine</strong>, as the term is used here, is a belief that is considered important without being essential. That is, a particular Christian church or denomination may consider the belief a test of fellowship without claiming that its denial amounts to apostasy. The denial of a doctrine may be considered heresy but not necessarily outright apostasy.</li>
<li>“A belief is relegated to the status of <strong>opinion</strong> when it is considered interesting but relatively unimportant to the faith of the church. One is allowed to believe whatever one wishes about the matter so long as it does not conflict with a dogma or doctrine. Denial of an opinion is simply a difference of interpretation.” (73).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grenz and Olson acknowledge that “there is no universal categorization” (74). This is “one major reason for the existence of different denominations” (73).</li>
<li>Dogma was the first category to develop in the history of the church, mainly around the ecumenical creeds and the deliberations behind them.</li>
<li>Doctrines have to do with particular traditions/denominations and criteria for membership.</li>
<li>Opinions are judged to be matters of private interpretation.</li>
<li>“One of the major activities of theologians, then, is to discover the proper location in this schema for each valid Christian belief. (Of course, if a belief is criticized as invalid or false, it is left out of the schema entirely)” (76.)</li>
<li>Some churches push everything toward the category of opinion, evacuating dogma and doctrine. Others push everything into dogma, evacuating doctrine and opinion.</li>

<li><a href="http://bookofconcord.org/fc-ep.php#X.%20Church%20Rites">Article 10 of the Formula of Concord</a> is devoted to the controversy “Concerning ceremonies or church rites which are neither commanded nor forbidden in God’s Word, but have been introduced into the Church for the sake of good order and propriety.”</li>
<li>The main question/debate was “whether, in time of persecution and in case of confession, even if the enemies of the Gospel have not reached an agreement with us in doctrine, some abrogated ceremonies, which in themselves are matters of indifference and are neither commanded nor forbidden by God, may nevertheless, upon the pressure and demand of the adversaries, be reestablished without violence to conscience, and we may thus [rightly] have conformity with them in such ceremonies and adiaphora. To this the one side has said Yea, the other, Nay.”</li>

<li>“the congregation of God of every place and every time has the power, according to its circumstances, to change such ceremonies in such manner as may be most useful and edifying to the congregation of God.”</li>
<li>“all frivolity and offense should be avoided, and special care should be taken to exercise forbearance towards the weak in faith. <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Cor.%208.9">1 Cor. 8:9</a> ; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom.%2014.13">Rom. 14:13</a> .”</li>
<li>“in time of persecution, when a plain [and steadfast] confession is required of us, we should not yield to the enemies in regard to such adiaphora, . . . For in such a case it is no longer a question concerning adiaphora, but concerning the truth of the Gospel, concerning [preserving] Christian liberty, and concerning sanctioning open idolatry, as also concerning the prevention of offense to the weak in the faith [how care should be taken lest idolatry be openly sanctioned and the weak in faith be offended]; in which we have nothing to concede, but should plainly confess and suffer on that account what God sends, and what He allows the enemies of His Word to inflict upon us.”</li>
<li>“no Church should condemn another because one has less or more external ceremonies not commanded by God than the other, if otherwise there is agreement among them in doctrine and all its articles, as also in the right use of the holy Sacraments, according to the well-known saying: Dissonantia ieiunii non dissolvit consonantiam fidei, Disagreement in fasting does not destroy agreement in faith.”</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>First-level theological issues</strong> would include <strong>those doctrines most central and essential to the Christian faith</strong>. Included among these most crucial doctrines would be doctrines such as the Trinity, the full deity and humanity of Jesus Christ, justification by faith, and the authority of Scripture. […]</p>
<p>The set of <strong>second-order doctrines</strong> is distinguished from the first-order set by the fact that <strong>believing Christians may disagree on the second-order issues, though this disagreement will create significant boundaries between believers</strong>. When Christians organize themselves into congregations and denominational forms, these boundaries become evident. […]</p>
<p><strong>Third-order issues</strong> are <strong>doctrines over which Christians may disagree and remain in close fellowship, even within local congregations</strong>. I would put most of the debates over eschatology, for example, in this category. Christians who affirm the bodily, historical, and victorious return of the Lord Jesus Christ may differ over timetable and sequence without rupturing the fellowship of the church. Christians may find themselves in disagreement over any number of issues related to the interpretation of difficult texts or the understanding of matters of common disagreement. Nevertheless, standing together on issues of more urgent importance, believers are able to accept one another without compromise when third-order issues are in question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In theology, just as in battle, some hills are worth dying on. But how do we know which ones? When should doctrine divide, and when should unity prevail? Pastor Gavin Ortlund makes the case that while all doctrines matter, some are more essential than others. He considers how and what to prioritize in doctrine and ministry, encouraging humility and grace along the way. Using four basic categories of doctrine in order of importance, this book helps new and seasoned church leaders alike wisely labor both to uphold doctrine and to preserve unity.</p>

Buckley, eds., <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2YNfr2o">The Morally Divided Body: Ethical Disagreement and the Disunity of the Church</a></em> (Cascade Books, 2010).</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ijst.12178">Charles Raith II’s review of this volume in IJST</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One overview of the major divisive issues in Christianity goes like this: in the early centuries divisive issues pertained to the relationship between Judaism and Christianity; in the third and fourth centuries they were over trinitarian theology and Christology; the sixteenth‐century centered on soteriology and ecclesiology; and today it is moral theology. While this is an obvious oversimplification, there is no question that debates over moral theology are today wreaking havoc in Christianity. Michael Root’s and James Buckley’s edited volume <em>The Morally Divided Body</em> addresses this phenomenon head on. The volume is a collection of essays given at the 2010 conference ‘The Morally Divided Body: Ethical Disagreement and the Disunity of the Churches’ hosted by the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology, New York. Unlike issues that are historically divisive between Catholics and Evangelicals, however, the debates surrounding moral theology create disagreements deeply divisive not so much between different ecclesial communities – Catholics and Evangelical – but internally, within ecclesial communities themselves.</p>
<p>Robert Jenson’s opening essay, ‘Can Ethical Disagreement Divide the Church?’ is one of the more intriguing of the collection and makes valid the whole pursuit of the volume: if the answer is ‘no’ then the notion of a ‘morally divided body’ is a fiction. Jenson argues otherwise: ‘the unbroken unity in Christ of baptized believers divided in moral discipline or public moral witness obtains at the <em>same</em> level as does the unity of baptized believers divided in doctrine’ (p. 2). Note the subtlety of Jenson’s point: there can be division within unity, and for Jenson it is the underlying unity of baptized believers that should force them to argue over the divisive issues. But <em>why</em> should ethical issues lead to ending eucharistic and ministerial fellowship? Jenson answers (as does David Yeago in his essay ‘Grace and the Good Life: Why the God of the Gospel Cares How We Live’ and Federick Christian Bauerschmidt in ‘Doctrine: Knowing and Doing’) that certain teachings can be <em>at once</em> doctrinal and ethical. An obvious case for Jenson is with marriage, in which morality and Christology cannot be separated. Yeago gets at the interconnection between morality and doctrine through the <em>imago dei</em>, which is lived out through the divine law – the law being a ‘mirror’ to the divine righteousness and ‘counterpart’ to the <em>imago dei</em> in human beings – and perfected in Jesus Christ. Thus for Yeago, ‘disputes about divine law involve, in the end, disputes about Jesus Christ, and therefore disputes about the gospel’ (p. 79). Against the ‘service unites, doctrine divides’ mantra, Bauerschmidt argues that ‘to separate doctrine and service, faith and works, the speculative and the practical is precisely to unravel the fabric of the Christian life, to facture the ecology of Christian belief and practice’ (p. 32). Bauerschmidt uses the phrase ‘moral ecology’ to capture the complex web of beliefs, institutions, practices, social habits and so forth that work together to determine what we praise and blame, what we pursue and avoid. Bauerschmidt draws on the Donatist controversy to address the interplay between ‘doctrinal’ and ‘moral’ matters. As Bauerschmidt understands it, ‘The specific ‘doctrinal’ question of sacramental efficacy was embedded in a host of other sorts of questions that might strike us as ‘moral’ and ‘ethical’ ones’ (p. 35).</p>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://mwerickson.com/">Matt Erickson</a> for <a href="https://micro.blog/mwerickson/7210452">drawing my attention</a> back to this 2017 blog exchange. It all started with James K.A. Smith wondering if it’s a mistake to use “(un)orthodox” language to describe contemporary debates about sexuality and marriage. Instead, Smith thinks/thought we should reserve “orthodoxy” language to refer to what’s explicitly stated in the ecumenical creeds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So perhaps we should be more careful with how we use the adjective <em>orthodox.</em> It can’t be a word we flippantly use to describe what is important to us. The word is reserved to define and delineate those affirmations that are at the very heart of Christian faith–and God knows they are scandalous enough in a secular age.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need to introduce another adjective–“traditional”–to describe these historic views and positions on matters of morality. Why? Because otherwise these other markers will end up trumping the conciliar marks of the Gospel. That is, the things we append <em>as</em> “orthodox” start to overwhelm and supersede what the church has defined as orthodox.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ability to discern the relative importance of theological beliefs is vital for effective Christian life and ministry. Both the purity and unity of the church are at stake in this matter. The relative importance of theological issues can fall within four categories:</p>
<p>1. <em>absolutes</em> define the core beliefs of the Christian faith;<br>
2. <em>convictions</em>, while not core beliefs, may have significant impact on the health and effectiveness of the church;<br>
3. <em>opinions</em> are less-clear issues that generally are not worth dividing over; and<br>
4. <em>questions</em> are currently unsettled issues.</p>
<p>These categories can be best visualized as concentric circles, similar to those on a dart board, with the absolutes as the “bull’s-eye”:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](http://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/justintaylor/files/2010/03/diagram-doctrine-01-300x298.png)<figcaption>Diagram is from Crossway.</figcaption></figure></div>> Where an issue falls within these categories should be determined by weighing the cumulative force of at least seven considerations:
> 
> 1\. biblical clarity;  
> 2\. relevance to the character of God;  
> 3\. relevance to the essence of the gospel;  
> 4\. biblical frequency and significance (how often in Scripture it is taught, and what weight Scripture places upon it);  
> 5\. effect on other doctrines;  
> 6\. consensus among Christians (past and present); and  
> 7\. effect on personal and church life.
> 
> These criteria for determining the importance of particular beliefs must be considered in light of their cumulative weight regarding the doctrine being considered. For instance, just the fact that a doctrine may go against the general consensus among believers (see item 6) does not necessarily mean it is wrong, although that might add some weight to the argument against it. All the categories should be considered collectively in determining how important an issue is to the Christian faith. The ability to rightly discern the difference between core doctrines and legitimately disputable matters will keep the church from either compromising important truth or needlessly dividing over peripheral issues.
<h3 id="heres-taylor-summarizing-wittmer">Here’s Taylor summarizing Wittmer:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Wittmer, professor of theology and historical theology at Grand Rapids Theological Seminary, wrote a helpful book entitled, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Stop-Believing-Living-Enough/dp/0310281164/bettwowor-20/?tag=bettwowor0e-20">Don’t Stop Believing: Why Living Like Jesus Is Not Enough</a></em>. He classifies Christian beliefs into three categories:</p>
<p>1. what you <em>must</em> believe<br>
2. what you must not <em>reject</em><br>
3. what you <em>should</em> believe</p>

<p>In a 2008 <a href="http://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/justintaylor/2008/12/08/interview-with-michael-wittmer/">interview with Dr. Wittmer</a>, I asked him to explain these categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These categories are my attempt to describe the relative importance of Christian beliefs, distinguishing between those beliefs essential for salvation and those essential for a healthy Christian worldview.</p>
<p><strong>[What You <em>Must</em> Believe]</strong></p>
<p>In the book of Acts, the bare minimum that a person must know and believe to be saved was that he was a sinner and that Jesus saved him from his sin. As Paul told the Philippian jailer, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved” (<a href="https://www.esv.org/Acts%2016%3A29-31/">Acts 16:29-31</a>; cf. 10:43). This is enough to counter the postmodern innovator argument that we can be saved without knowing and believing in Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>[What You Must Not <em>Reject</em>]</strong></p>
<p>But any thinking convert will inquire further about this Jesus. While he may not know much more at the point of conversion than Jesus is the Lord who has saved him, he will quickly learn about Jesus’ life, death, resurrection, deity and humanity, and relation to the other two members of the Trinity. Anyone who rejects these core doctrines should fear for their soul.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ccel.org/creeds/athanasian.creed.html">Athanasian Creed</a>, whoever does not believe in the Trinity and the two natures of Jesus is damned. However, since it seems possible for a child to come to faith without knowing much about the Trinity or the hypostatic union (this is likely not the place where most parents begin), I take the Creed’s warning in a more benign way—that we do not need to know and believe in the Trinity and two natures of Christ to be saved, but that anyone who knowingly rejects them cannot be saved.</p>
<p><strong>[What You <em>Should</em> Believe]</strong></p>
<p>The final category is important doctrines which genuine Christians may unfortunately misconstrue. I think that every Christian should believe that Scripture is God’s Word, know its story of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation, and know something about the nature of God, what it means to be human, and what Jesus is doing through his church. However, many people have been genuine Christians without knowing or believing these things (though their ignorance or disbelief in these facts significantly diminished their Christian faith).</p>
<p>Thus, I believe that every doctrine in this diagram is crucially important for sound Christian faith. And some are so important that we cannot even be saved without them.</p>

Treier, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2RP9Asg">Theology and the Mirror of Scripture: A Mere Evangelical Account</a></em> (IVP Academic, 2015), 45–53, 122–27, 196–220.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Note that Vanhoozer and Treier are attempting to articular “mere evangelical theology.”</li>
<li>They propose the model of an “anchored set,” in which the anchor is the being of the Triune God (52).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mere evangelical theology, as an anchored set, can initially be characterized in terms of two principles, one material (substantive), one formal (stylistic), each with three entailments. As to substance, mere evangelical theology is (1) <em>orthodox</em>, conforming to the early creeds; (2) <em>catholic</em>, spanning all the times and places where there has been a local church; and (3) <em>Protestant</em>, affirming of the Reformation <em>solas</em>. As to style, it is (1) <em>radical</em>, first, because ancored in the root (<em>radix</em>) of the gospel—the triune God—and, second, because this rootedness leads it to confront the world with the claims of the gospel; (2) <em>irenic</em>, acknowledging that we need many perspectives and people groups fully to appreciate the gospel’s wealth of meaning; and (3) <em>joyful</em>, first because it takes its bearings from the best of all words that can be heard and, second, because it takes its energy from the Spirit, the minister of God’s word and the giver of God’s life. (52).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Here’s how they frame things a bit later in the book.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mere evangelical theology likewise needs wisdom to know the difference between courageously preserving the truths of the gospel that cannot change and charitably acknowledging the interpretive diversity of nonessential truths</em>. The material principles, the substance, of mere evangelical theology are strong Trinitarianism and strong crucicentrism, each focusing on <em>what is in Christ</em>. Lending credence to these material principles are the formal principles that run in tandem: the magisterial authority of the canonical Scriptures and the ministerial authority of the catholic tradition. (123).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Apostolicity: the magisterial authority of canonical judgments. To determine essentials here, Vanhoozer and Treier propose asking “what would preserve the integrity of the story of salvation” (124).</li>
<li>Catholicity: the ministerial authority of the scope of the Spirit’s illumination.
<ul>
<li>First-level doctrine:
<ul>
<li>“one that identifies the persons of the triune God on whom the gospel’s integrity depends”</li>
<li>“one in which the communion of the saints has already formed a consensus”</li>
<li>“the agreed universal judgments of the church: what Christians at all times and places must confess in order to preserve the gospel’s intelligibility (the material principle) and partake of the fellowship of the saints (the formal principle).</li>
<li>Dogmas: “teachings for which the Spirit has seen fit to illuminate the whole church. To deny a dogma is tantamount to apostasy or heresy.” (125)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level-two doctrines:
<ul>
<li>“treat events (e.g., atonement, resurrection) and aspects of salvation history (e.g., image of God, sin, justification) that must be affirmed, though there is some scope for different interpretations”</li>
<li>“lack full catholicity: they are the doctrines on which evangelicals who affirm <em>sola Scriptura</em> have not reached agreement”</li>
<li>“often represent points of significant ‘regional’ difference—points important enough to require for membership and shared ministry within a church or denomination, yet without impeding all translocal cooperation between evangelicals” (125–26).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level-three doctrines:
<ul>
<li>“allow for considerable freedom of opinion without fostering congregational division. For differences over them are not damaging to the gospel or debilitating for shared mission”</li>
<li>“That Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead is first order, the nature of the millennium is second order and the exact sequence of events pertaining to the millennium is probably third order” (126).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wisdom: Increasing in (apostolic) word and (catholic) Spirit. (126–27).</li>
</ul>
<p>Later in the book, Vanhoozer and Treier flesh-out this first-, second-, and third-order doctrinal framework with biblical engagement (196–207).</p>
<ul>
<li>“Gospel versus heresy: Discerning dialogue” (summary of the gospel in 1 Cor. 15; pp. 198–201)</li>
<li>“Ministry and ministry: Maintaining fellowship” (conflict between Paul and Barnabas in Acts 15:36–41; pp. 202–204)</li>
<li>“The same mind: Pursuing collaboration” (Paul’s instructions in Romans 14–15; pp. 204–7)</li>

      <title>Are the Beatitudes “Renunciations” (Verzichte)?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/are-the-beatitudes-renunciations-verzichte/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Discipleship&lt;/em&gt; (DBWE 4), Dietrich Bonhoeffer frames all of the Beatitudes in terms of Jesus’ disciples living in &lt;em&gt;renunciation&lt;/em&gt; (Verzicht) and &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; (Mangel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, for Bonhoeffer, Jesus is only speaking to his disciples in the Beatitudes (he makes this argument on the basis of Luke 6:20ff.). And the disciples’ renunciation and want are &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; by Jesus’s call to discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus sees&lt;/em&gt;: his disciples are over there. They have visibly left the people to join him. He has called each individual one. They have given up everything in response to his call. Now they are living in renunciation and want; they are the poorest of the poor, the most tempted of the tempted, the hungriest of the hungry. They have only him. Yes, and with him they have nothing in the world, nothing at all, but everything, everything with God. (DBWE 4:101).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <em>Discipleship</em> (DBWE 4), Dietrich Bonhoeffer frames all of the Beatitudes in terms of Jesus’ disciples living in <em>renunciation</em> (Verzicht) and <em>want</em> (Mangel).</p>
<p>Interestingly, for Bonhoeffer, Jesus is only speaking to his disciples in the Beatitudes (he makes this argument on the basis of Luke 6:20ff.). And the disciples’ renunciation and want are <em>caused</em> by Jesus’s call to discipleship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Jesus sees</em>: his disciples are over there. They have visibly left the people to join him. He has called each individual one. They have given up everything in response to his call. Now they are living in renunciation and want; they are the poorest of the poor, the most tempted of the tempted, the hungriest of the hungry. They have only him. Yes, and with him they have nothing in the world, nothing at all, but everything, everything with God. (DBWE 4:101).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bonhoeffer also writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, “Blessed!” Jesus is speaking to the disciples (cf. Luke 6:20ff.). He is speaking to those who are already under the power of his call. That call has made them poor, tempted, and hungry. He calls them blessed, not because of their want or renunciation. Neither want nor renunciation are in themselves any reason to be called blessed. The only adequate reason is the call and the promise, for whose sake those following him live in want and renunciation. (DBWE 4:101).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Bonhoeffer is willing to frame all of the Beatitudes in terms of want and (especially) renunciation, he takes issue with August Tholuck’s distinction between some of the Beatitudes speaking of want “and others of the disciples’ intentional renunciation or special virtues” (DBWE 4:101; cf. Tholuck, <em>Commentary</em>, 64). Not, note, because Bonhoeffer has a problem with framing the Beatitudes in terms of renunciation and want, but rather because he thinks that “Objective want and personal renunciation have their joint basis in Christ’s call and promise” (DBWE 4:101–2).</p>
<p>In this connection, Bonhoeffer has a lengthy footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no basis in scripture for constructing a contrast between Matthew and Luke. Matthew is not interested in spiritualizing the original Beatitude (Luke’s form), nor is Luke interested in politicizing any original Beatitudes (Matthew’s form) referring only to “state of mind.” Need is not the basis of blessedness in Luke, nor is renunciation the basis in Matthew. Rather, in both, need or renunciation, spiritual or political matters are justified only by the call and promise of Jesus, who alone makes the Beatitudes into what they are, and who alone is the basis of calling those matters blessed. Catholic exegesis, starting with the letters of Clement, wanted to have the virtue of poverty declared blessed, thinking on the one hand of the paupertas voluntaria [voluntary poverty] of the monks, on the other hand of any voluntary poverty for Christ’s sake. In both cases the mistake in interpretation lies in seeking to make some human behavior the basis for blessedness, and not solely Jesus’ call and promise. (DBWE 4:102n2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for Bonhoeffer, Christ’s call is clearly central—not human behavior. And yet, Christ’s call seems to cause the human situations in view in the Beatitudes.</p>
<h2 id="heres-how-bonhoeffer-frames-the-beatitudes-in-terms-of-want-and-renunciation">Here’s how Bonhoeffer frames the Beatitudes in terms of “want” and “renunciation.”</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blessed are the poor in spirit -&gt; “those who live thoroughly in <em>renunciation and want</em> for Jesus’ sake” (DBWE 4:103).</li>
<li>Blessed are those who mourn -&gt; “those who are prepared to renounce and live without everything the world calls <em>happiness</em> and <em>peace</em>” (DBWE 4:103; cf. DBWE 1:184).</li>
<li>Blessed are the meek -&gt; those “who <em>renounce all rights of their own</em> for the sake of Jesus Christ” (DBWE 4:105).</li>
<li>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness -&gt; “Disciples live with not only renouncing their own rights, but even <em>renouncing their own righteousness</em>” (DBWE 4:105).</li>
<li>Blessed are the merciful -&gt; “these followers of Jesus live with him now also in the <em>renunciation of their own dignity</em>, for they are merciful” (DBWE 4:106).</li>
<li>Blessed are the pure in heart -&gt; “Those who <em>renounce their own good and evil</em>, their own heart, who are contrite and depend solely on Jesus” (DBWE 4:107).</li>
<li>Blessed are the peacemakers -&gt; those who “<em>renounce violence and strife</em>” (DBWE 4:108).</li>
<li>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake -&gt; “In judgment and action <strong>those who follow Jesus will be different from the world in renouncing property, happiness, rights, righteousness, honor, and violence.</strong> They will be offensive to the world. That is why the disciples will be persecuted for righteousness’ sake. Not recognition, but rejection, will be their reward from the world for their word and deed.” (DBWE 4:109, <strong>emphasis added</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>According to an editorial footnote, Eberhard Bethge’s notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>say that “everything is renunciation; nothing is Christian doctrine of virtue. Difference between ‘active and passive’ (making ethical distinction) is invalid” (22). As early as lectures of 1935 and 1935–36, Bonhoeffer sees the Beatitudes summarized in Matt. 5:10f. (DBWE 109n43).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, because I’m working on how Barth and Bonhoeffer read Genesis 1–3 and Matthew 5–7, I’m especially interested in the resonances between what Bonhoeffer has to say about the “pure in heart” renouncing their “good and evil.”</p>
<p>However, on a broader level, I’m curious where he got this thoroughgoing emphasis on “renunciation” (Verzicht) from.</p>

      <title>Are the Beatitudes “Good Works”? (Matt. 5:13–16)</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/are-the-beatitudes-good-works-matt-51316/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 19:13:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/are-the-beatitudes-good-works-matt-51316/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I wrote just a bit about &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/interpretive-approaches-to-the-beatitudes/&#34;&gt;interpretive approaches to the Beatitudes in Matthew 5&lt;/a&gt;. I’m trying to get a better handle on how Barth and Bonhoeffer treat the Sermon on the Mount, and I’m starting with the Beatitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the “standard” approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. A case in point: yesterday, I felt pretty confident that Bonhoeffer does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take the standard “entrance requirements” approach to the Beatitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I wrote just a bit about <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/interpretive-approaches-to-the-beatitudes/">interpretive approaches to the Beatitudes in Matthew 5</a>. I’m trying to get a better handle on how Barth and Bonhoeffer treat the Sermon on the Mount, and I’m starting with the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>However, it’s pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the “standard” approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. A case in point: yesterday, I felt pretty confident that Bonhoeffer does <em>not</em> take the standard “entrance requirements” approach to the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>After all, Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Jesus] calls them blessed, not because of their want or renunciation. Neither want nor renunciation are in themselves any reason to be called blessed. The only adequate reason is the call and the promise, for whose sake those following him live in want and renunciation.” (DBWE 4:101).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, complicating things just a bit, in his discussion of the “salt and light” passage in Matthew 5:13–16, Bonhoeffer seems to equate the Beatitudes with “good works”!</p>
<p>Here are the verses in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 “You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot.</p>
<p>14 “You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. 15 No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. (NRSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of his discussion of these verses, Bonhoeffer relates Christ’s cross to the visibility and “good works” of the disciples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The good works of the disciples should be seen in this light. “Not you, but your good works should be seen,” says Jesus. What are these good works which can be seen in this light? They can be no other works than those Jesus himself created in the disciples when he called them, when he made them the light of the world under his cross—poverty, being strangers, meekness, peacemaking, and finally being persecuted and rejected, and in all of them the one work: bearing the cross of Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the connection with the Beatitudes. Bonhoeffer continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cross is that strange light which shines there, by which alone all these good works of the disciples can be seen. Nowhere does it say that God becomes visible, but that the “good works” will be seen, and that the people will praise God for these works. The cross becomes visible, and the works of the cross become visible. The want and renunciation of the blessed become visible. But human beings can never be praised for the cross and for such a faith-community, only God can be praised. If the good works were all sorts of human virtues, then the disciples, not the Father, would be praised for them. As it is, there is nothing to praise in the disciple who bears the cross, or in the faith-community whose light so shines, which stands visibly on the mountain—only the Father in heaven can be praised for their “good works.” That is why they see the cross and the community of the cross, and have faith in God. There, then, shines the light of the resurrection. (DBWE 4:114).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>R.T. France agrees, noting the connection between these “good deeds” and the Beatitudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase “good deeds” conveys the qualities set out in the beatitudes, and especially the “righteousness” of life which is to be characteristic of disciples (cf. vv. 6, 10, 20); the phrase and the concept are echoed in 1 Pet 2:11–12. It is only as this distinctive lifestyle is visible to others that it can have its desired effect. But that effect is also now spelled out not as the improvement and enlightenment of society as such, but rather as the glorifying of God by those outside the disciple community. The subject of this discourse, and the aim of the discipleship which it promotes, is not so much the betterment of life on earth as the implementation of the reign of God. The goal of disciples’ witness is not that others emulate their way of life, or applaud their probity, but that they recognize the source of their distinctive lifestyle in “your Father in heaven.” (<em>The Gospel of Matthew</em>, NICNT, 177).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll admit that I’m used to taking Matthew 5:13–16 in a more mundane and less eschatological sense than Bonhoeffer. I’ve interpreted Jesus’ words as more along the lines of “mind your reputation in the eyes of outsiders” than “demonstrate good deeds that, because they are at cross-purposes with the world, won’t even be recognized as such other than eschatologically.”</p>
<p>After all, <em>when</em> will the outsiders glorify God? Now? Or, as it were, at the end of days? Here’s what 1 Peter 2:11–12 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beloved, I urge you as aliens and exiles to abstain from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul. Conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that, though they malign you as evildoers, they may see your honorable deeds and glorify God when he comes to judge (ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπισκοπῆς, “in [the] day of visitation”). (NRSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Bonhoeffer, France, and Barth are all right to draw our attention back to the eschatological character of the Sermon on the Mount. Yet, I have to agree with France when he explains “the eschatological character of the promises” in the Beatitudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A distinctive feature of these beatitudes (and of those of Luke 6:20–22) is that they not only list the qualities commended, but they also explain that commendation by a promise appropriate to each quality. The second half of each line is as important as, and indeed is the basis for, the first. All but the first and last are expressed as promises for the future, and the question is often raised whether that future is envisaged as fulfilled within the earthly sphere, or whether it looks to compensation beyond this life. The third beatitude, with its echo of Ps 37:11, raises the issue particularly acutely: “inherit the earth” (or perhaps “the land,” see below) sounds more concrete than a purely heavenly reward. So are these beatitudes speaking of benefits “now in this age” and not only “in the age to come”? That is the language Jesus uses in Mark 10:30, but we shall note that Matt 19:28–29 avoids such an explicit dichotomy, and is worded in such a way that it can be read as speaking only of heavenly reward. On the other hand, the present tense used in verses 3b and 10b, “it is to them that the kingdom of heaven belongs,” warns against a purely futuristic interpretation, and suggests that the simple dichotomy between “now” and “then” may miss the breadth of Matthew’s conception of the blessings of the kingdom of heaven. The kingdom of heaven has already arrived (4:17, and see on 3:2), and so these are people who are already under God’s beneficent rule. The advantages of being God’s people can then be expected to accrue already in this life, even though the full consummation of their blessedness remains for the future. The tension between “now” and “not yet,” so familiar from much of the rest of the NT, may appropriately be seen as running also through the promises of Matt 5:3–10. (The Gospel of Matthew, NICNT, 164).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even just the mixture of verbal tenses in the Beatitudes reminds me of <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/when-will-thy-kingdom-come-the-timing-and-agency-of-the-kingdom-of-god-in-the-lords-prayer/">the complex interplay between the “already” and the “not yet” when it comes to the Lord’s Prayer</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, when interpreting the Sermon on the Mount, the best place to start is at the beginning! This means beginning with the Beatitudes in Matthew 5:1–12.</p>
<h2 id="the-beatitudes-matt-5112">The Beatitudes (Matt. 5:1–12)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>1 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. 2 Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:</p>
<p>3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>4 “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</p>
<p>5 “Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.</p>
<p>6 “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.</p>
<p>7 “Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.</p>
<p>8 “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</p>
<p>9 “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.</p>
<p>10 “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>11 “Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. 12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. (Matt. 5:1–12, NRSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="heres-lukes-version-of-the-beatitudes-luke-62026">Here’s Luke’s version of the Beatitudes (Luke 6:20–26)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>20 Then he looked up at his disciples and said:</p>
<p>“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>21 “Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.</p>
<p>“Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.</p>
<p>22 “Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. 23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets.</p>
<p>24 “But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.</p>
<p>25 “Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.</p>
<p>“Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.</p>
<p>26 “Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors did to the false prophets. (Luke 6:20–26, NRSV).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so-what-should-we-make-of-the-beatitudes">So, what should we make of the Beatitudes?</h2>
<p>Of course, the differences between Matthew’s and Luke’s versions of the Beatitudes have prompted considerable discussion within biblical studies.</p>
<p>As Jason C. Kuo notes in his “Beatitudes” article in <em>The Lexham Bible Dictionary</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some believe that only a few of the Beatitudes originate from Jesus Himself. Based on an examination of the background and the overlapping beatitudes between Matthew and Luke, Davies and Allison suggest that only three are original—“Jesus utters three paradoxical beatitudes: blessed are the poor, blessed are those who mourn, and blessed are those who hunger” (Davies and Allison, Matthew, 435). Others, however, suggest that at least eight of the nine can be traced to Jesus Himself. Hagner contends, “To assert that only three go back to Jesus assumes criteria that are too restrictive and presumes to know more than we can know” (Hagner, Matthew, 90). Blomberg suggests the possibility that “both Matthew and Luke might be excerpting from an original set of eight Beatitudes and eight woes” (Blomberg, Matthew, 98).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all due respect to these “Matthew vs. Luke” discussions, I’m much more interested in how people have gone about making sense of the Beatitudes in the context of the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5–7.</p>
<p>Again, here’s Kuo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A number of different approaches can be employed in interpreting the Beatitudes. They have been typically understood as primarily (1) pronouncing rewards for the virtuous, (2) signaling reversals for the unfortunate, or (3) combining elements of the two (Powell, “Matthew’s Beatitudes,” 460).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how Warren Carter summarizes the interpretive debates in his “Beatitudes” article in <em>Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has also been considerable debate about how to interpret Matthew’s beatitudes. Do they promise eschatological rewards for the virtuous who manifest these characteristics in their lives, or do they proclaim God’s reversals for those who find themselves in these unfortunate circumstances? Are the Beatitudes ethicized “entrance requirements” exhorting readers to a way of life by which they might enter God’s reign? Or are they “eschatological blessings” announced on those who already encounter God’s reign in part? Or is it possible to read them in one consistent way? To “mourn” in Matt. 5:4 does not necessarily seem to be a virtue, while to be a “peacemaker” is not a situation that needs reversing. (p. 159).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, that’s a really interesting observation to make regarding “mourn” and “peacemaker.” Are we perhaps trying to parse things out too finely if we try to make the Beatitudes fit into a single interpretive framework?</p>
<p>After all, I agree with Kuo that, regardless of which framework we go with, we need to remember to keep the focus on “the kingdom of God.” As Kuo puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the approach, the Beatitudes provide a framework for the people of God to understand what it means to be a part of the kingdom. Turner notes, “The theological purpose of the Sermon on the Mount in general and of the beatitudes in particular centers in the kingdom of heaven” (Turner, “Whom Does God Approve,” 36). In conjunction with the Sermon on the Mount, members of the kingdom are to be salt and light (Matt 5:13–16), providing an example as a “contrast community” (Bailey, “Model for Community,” 86) in the world. The Beatitudes—with their pronouncements of blessings as rewards and reversals—communicate a value system that is of the kingdom of God. Finally, as Davies and Allison conclude, the Beatitudes “bring consolation and comfort to Jesus’ heavy-laden followers … putting into perspective the difficulties of the present,” giving believers a “hope that makes powerlessness and suffering bearable” (Davies and Allison, Matthew, 467).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-about-barth-and-bonhoeffer">What about Barth and Bonhoeffer?</h2>
<p>For me, it’s still early days in trying to make sense of Barth and Bonhoeffer. Nevertheless, I’m comfortable with claiming that they both take a “synthetic” and “christological” approach to the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>“Synthetic” as in “not analytic.” As Merriam-Webster puts it: “attributing to a subject something determined by observation rather than analysis of the nature of the subject and not resulting in self-contradiction if negated.” (Compare/contrast “analytic,” as in: “being a proposition [as “no bachelor is married”] whose truth is evident from the meaning of the words it contains.”)</p>
<p>This is the language that Barth uses to describe the Beatitudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the sufferers of this world cannot pride themselves on the fact that their lives have this transparency, that the kingdom, Jesus, is in fact near to them. The declaration that they are blessed is a synthetic and not an analytic statement, referring to the objective thing that characterises their existence from above and not from below. To them, too, the new thing is said when they are called blessed in relation to their misery. Neither they nor their misery create the fact that they exist in that light of Jesus. It is simply the case, and they are called blessed simply because of that which is indicated by their misery: “The poor have the gospel preached to them” (Mt. 11:5). (CD IV/2, 191).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit later, Barth writes: “It is also clear that in so far as it entails suffering it is not an enviable situation. In this connexion, too, suffering is not joy. Again the beatitude is a synthetic and not an analytic statement.” (CD IV/2, 191).</p>
<p>So, for Barth, the Beatitudes are statements of self-evident truths. Instead, they are statements that are made true by the particular relationships between Jesus and the people in question.</p>
<p>Although Bonhoeffer doesn’t use the “synthetic vs. analytic” language, he seems to be saying much the same thing in <em>Discipleship</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, “Blessed!” Jesus is speaking to the disciples (cf. Luke 6:20ff.). He is speaking to those who are already under the power of his call. That call has made them poor, tempted, and hungry. He calls them blessed, not because of their want or renunciation. Neither want nor renunciation are in themselves any reason to be called blessed. The only adequate reason is the call and the promise, for whose sake those following him live in want and renunciation. The observation that some of the Beatitudes speak of want and others of the disciples’ intentional renunciation or special virtues has no special meaning. Objective want and personal renunciation have their joint basis in Christ’s call and promise. Neither of them has any value or claim in itself. (DBWE 4:101–2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things strike me as interesting about that paragraph. First, note how Bonhoeffer is willing to use Luke’s parallel to make a conclusion about whom Jesus is speaking to in the Beatitudes. I think I disagree with Bonhoeffer here, because, in Matthew, the Sermon on the Mount seems to be addressed to both the disciples and the crowds—the boundaries between the two groups being, in some sense, still up for grabs.</p>
<p>Second, in the penultimate sentence (“The observation that…”), as the editors note, Bonhoeffer is taking issue with Tholuck’s interpretation of the Beatitudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tholuck observes: “These eight beatitudes are arranged in an ethical order. The first four are of a negative character.… The three following … set forth what attributes of character are required in the members of that kingdom” (<em>Commentary</em>, 64). (DBWE 4:101n6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can hear the “entrance requirements for the kingdom” coming through loud and clear in Tholuck. To me, both Barth and Bonhoeffer push back against the “entrance requirements” view, without thereby committing them to a single interpretive framework at the expense of the others.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m working on how Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer read the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-order-to-help-situate-my-discussion-of-barths-and-bonhoeffers-readings-im-trying-to-get-a-better-grasp-of-the-various-interpretive-approaches-to-the-sermon-on-the-mount&#34;&gt;In order to help situate my discussion of Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s readings, I’m trying to get a better grasp of the various interpretive approaches to the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the most exhaustive Sermon on the Mount “interpretive taxonomy” that I’ve found has been from Grant &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/37oTuuA&#34;&gt;Osborne’s &lt;em&gt;Matthew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament; Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2010), 159.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So far, the most exhaustive Sermon on the Mount “interpretive taxonomy” that I’ve found has been from Grant <a href="https://amzn.to/37oTuuA">Osborne’s <em>Matthew</em></a> (Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament; Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2010), 159.</p>
<p>Here are the approaches that Osborne lists, as summarized by Jason C. Kuo in his “Sermon on the Mount/Plain” article in <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/36564/lexham-bible-dictionary"><em>The Lexham Bible Dictionary</em></a> (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2016).</p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>medieval</strong> approach—two levels of ethics with a higher set of standards for clergy and monastic members.</li>
<li><strong>Luther’s</strong> approach—the sermon discloses our depravity and brings us to repentance.</li>
<li>An <strong>Anabaptist</strong> approach—the sermon is a call to pacifism.</li>
<li>A <strong>liberal</strong> approach—the sermon is a paradigm for the social gospel.</li>
<li>An <strong>existentialist</strong> approach—the sermon is not absolute, but a challenge to personal decision.</li>
<li><strong>Schweitzer’s</strong> approach—the sermon is an “interim ethic” leading to a temporary set of codes to follow.</li>
<li>The <strong>dispensational</strong> approach—the sermon is limited in scope to the “future millennial kingdom” and applies only to the Jews, not to the church.</li>
<li>The “<strong>inaugurated eschatology</strong>” approach—believers should attempt to follow the commands, but full observance will only happen after Christ returns.</li>
<li>A <strong>wisdom</strong> teaching approach—Jesus was expressing His convictions using wisdom forms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, of course, the question is how best to situate Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s approaches!</p>
<h2 id="have-you-come-across-any-other-interpretive-frameworks-for-the-sermon-on-the-mount-that-you-would-add-to-this-paradigm">Have you come across any other interpretive frameworks for the Sermon on the Mount that you would add to this paradigm?</h2>
<p>Kuo notes D.A. Carson’s discussion (which can now be found in his Matthew commentary in <em>The Expositor’s Bible Commentary</em>, revised edition, volume 9, 155–57).</p>
<p>Carson notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attempt to understand the Sermon on the Mount within a unified theological grid has not produced consistent results. Schweizer lists seven major interpretive approaches; Harvey K. McArthur (<em>Understanding the Sermon on the Mount</em> [New York: Harper, 1960], 105–48) lists twelve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carson then proceeds to list:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. Lutheran orthodoxy (Osborne’s #2)</li>
<li>b. realized eschatology, moral road map (Osborne’s #4?)</li>
<li>c. “a set of moral standards used catechetically within Matthew’s community”</li>
<li>d. Anabaptist-Mennonite: applies to “all believers in every age and every circumstance” (cites Hauerwas’s Matthew commentary). (Osborne’s #3)</li>
<li>e. Existential: personal decision, authentic faith. (Osborne’s #5)</li>
<li>f. “Interim ethic” (Osborne’s #6)</li>
<li>g. Evangelicals and others, “interpret the Sermon on the Mount as an intensifying or radicalizing of the OT moral law” (cites Stott’s <em>Message of the Sermon on the Mount)</em></li>
<li>h. Classic dispensationalism: “law for millennial kingdom first offered by Jesus to the Jews.” Has faced numerous challenges, revised by J. Dwight Pentecost and John Walvoord. (Osborne’s #7?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Carson critiques all of these approaches as he goes along. He then briefly covers “several scholars [who] have narrowed the focus.”</p>
<p>What’s Carson’s view? He maintain’s that “[t]he unifying theme of the sermon is the kingdom of heaven.” The Sermon on the Mount</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“provides ethical guidelines for life in the kingdom, but does so within an explanation of the place of the contemporary setting within redemption history and Jesus’ relation to the OT (5:17–20). The community forming around him, his ‘disciples,’ is not yet so cohesive and committed a group that exhortations to ‘enter’ (7:13–14) are irrelevant. The glimpse of kingdom life (horizontally and vertically) in these chapters anticipates not only the love commandments (22:34–40) but also grace (5:3; 6:12; 7:7–11; cf. 21:28–46)” (157).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each participant should be committed to the task of <strong>earnestly searching for the truth or at least the most defensible position on the issue at stake</strong>.

</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-the-clarity-principle">3. The Clarity Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The formulations of all positions, defenses, and attacks should be <strong>free of any kind of linguistic confusion and clearly separated from other positions and issues</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a participant’s argument is reformulated by an opponent, it should be <strong>carefully expressed in its strongest possible version that is consistent with what is believed to be the original intention of the arguer</strong>.

<h2 id="6-the-structural-principle">6. The Structural Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One who argues for or against a position should <strong>use an argument that meets the fundamental structural requirements of a well-formed argument</strong>.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If no position is defended by a good argument, or if two or more positions seem to be defended with equal strength, one should, in most cases, suspend judgment about the issue</strong>. If practical considerations seem to require a more immediate decision, one should weigh the relative benefits or harm connected with the consequences of suspending judgment and decide the issue on those grounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="12-the-resolution-principle">12. The Resolution Principle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An issue should be considered <strong>resolved if the argument for one of the alternative positions is a structurally sound one that uses relevant and acceptable reasons that together provide sufficient grounds to justify the conclusion and that also includes an effective rebuttal to all serious criticisms of the argument and/or the position it supports</strong>. Unless one can demonstrate that the argument has not met these conditions more successfully than any argument presented for alternative positions, one is obligated to accept its conclusion and consider the issue to be settled. If the argument is subsequently found by any participant to be flawed in a way that raises new doubts about the merit of the position it supports, one is obligated to reopen the issue for further consideration and resolution.</p>

<hr>
<p>I am grateful to <a href="http://theopolisinstitute.com/sacramental-representation-and-the-created-order/">Fr. Blake Johnson</a> and <a href="http://anglicancompass.com/the-problem-with-making-a-patristic-argument-for-the-ordination-of-women-a-response-to-emily-mcgowin/">Fr. Lee Nelson</a> for their responses to my previous blog post, <a href="http://anglicancompass.com/if-women-can-be-saved-then-women-can-be-priests/">“If Women Can Be Saved, Then Women Can Be Priests.”</a></p>
<p>I begin with a point of clarification: My piece was intentionally narrow. I offered a critique of the <em>in persona Christi</em> argument against women’s ordination to the priesthood. I was not offering a full argument for women’s ordination. It seems some confusion has resulted from those who assume I was doing the latter rather than the former.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I am glad to see Johnson and Nelson have broadened the discussion on this subject. They help to demonstrate that the conclusion one draws regarding women in the priesthood depends not only upon the christological issue I raised initially, but also a variety of other weighty matters, including biblical interpretation, how one draws upon the sources of the tradition, and more.</p>
<h2 id="beginning-with-scripture">Beginning with Scripture</h2>
<p>While both authors raise a variety of issues worthy of engagement, I want to begin with biblical interpretation (something Nelson faults me for not doing enough of). Since both Johnson and Nelson root their arguments in a particular reading of Genesis 2, I’ll focus my attention there. In what follows, I am drawing, in part, upon conversations with my Wheaton College colleague, <a href="http://www.wheaton.edu/academics/faculty/aubrey-buster/">Dr. Aubrey Buster</a>.</p>
<h3 id="genesis-2">Genesis 2</h3>
<h4 id="first-in-genesis-22122-the-hebrew-word-tsela-does-not-mean-rib-as-nelson-suggests">First, in Genesis 2:21–22, the Hebrew word <em>tsela’</em> does not mean “rib” as Nelson suggests.</h4>
<p>It is translated “rib” by some Bible translations today, but that translation is not demonstrative of the best scholarship on the subject.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.logos.com/product/5226/hebrew-and-aramaic-lexicon-of-the-old-testament"><em>HALOT</em></a>, the current standard Hebrew lexicon, there is no other occurrence in the Hebrew Bible where <em>tsela’</em> means “rib”. In every other case, it is translated “side” (see p. 1030). The Septuagint translates the Hebrew with the Greek word <em>pleura</em>, which also means “side.” Even in cognate languages where it is used for animal or human anatomy, it refers to the side of the chest.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h4>
<p>Because the scriptures say Eve is constructed out of Adam’s <em>side.</em> Eve is derivative in the sense of being taken from Adam (like Adam was taken from the earth), but decidedly <em>not</em> derivative in the sense of subordinate to Adam; she is his <em>side,</em> one half of a whole. The theological point of Genesis 2 is not to emphasize the <em>hierarchical</em> <em>difference</em> between Adam and Eve, whether in terms of ontology, function, or roles, but their <em>similarity</em>. Put simply, Adam and Eve are made of the same stuff. Eve is not an alien creature. She is Adam’s side—his own flesh and bone—which Dr. John Walton calls Adam’s “ontological equal” (see <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2NXWq9N">The Lost World of Adam and Eve</a></em>, p. 110).</p>
<p>Interpreters of Genesis note that chapters 1 and 2 appear to be intentionally subversive of the creation stories and cosmologies of the nations surrounding the people of Israel. The same holds true in the creation of woman. It was quite common in the cultures of the ANE to view women as creatures of inferior ontology in comparison to men. (Not just the ANE, of course, but in Greek thought, too, where the supposed inferior ontology of women becomes more institutionalized.) The biblical narrative is, in Walton’s words, “operating in the same room of discourse” as the ANE, but “Genesis has rearranged all the furniture”. The author is offering a subversive, countercultural perspective: one that affirms the full humanity and God-ordained status of women side-by-side with men.</p>
<h4 id="second-a-close-reading-of-the-text-shows-that-the-task-for-which-eve-is-created-is-the-same-task-for-which-the-man-is-created">Second, a close reading of the text shows that the task for which Eve is created is the <em>same</em> task for which the man is created.</h4>
<p>Johnson rightly notes that God gives to the man a task, namely to “keep and to guard” the garden (v. 15), which parallels the temple service of the Levites (see Num. 3:8-9). And it is in the context of <em>this task</em> that God says it is not good for him to be alone (v. 18).</p>
<p>That is to say, is it not good for Adam to do his keeping and guarding work alone. Instead, he must have an <em>ezer kenegdo</em> (v. 18): an “ally (one who aids someone in accomplishing a task) of the same kind.” What is this ally-ship for, but for the task for which the man was created? Eve will be the one who helps him in accomplishing the task given him by God.</p>
<p>Others have written about the significance of <em>ezer</em> in Gen. 2:18, so I won’t duplicate their work here. I’ll simply point out that the word <em>ezer</em> occurs 21 times in the Bible: it is used twice to describe the woman in Gen. 2, sixteen times to describe God, and three times to describe an army aiding in battle.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>in Exod. 18:4: “…the name of the other, Eliezer (for he said, “The God of my father was my <em>help</em>, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”).</li>
<li>In Deut. 33:26: “There is none like God, O Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens to your <em>help</em>, through the skies in his majesty.”</li>
<li>And Ps. 33:20: “Our soul waits for the Lord; he is our <em>help</em> and our shield.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The word <em>ezer</em> is never used to refer to aid in procreation and there is certainly never any sense of subordination in its usage (especially since it is used so often to speak of God himself!). In most contexts, <em>ezer</em> is referring to something related to the military, hence the translation of “ally” offered above.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Gen. 2 there is no reference in the creation of woman to her function as “life-giver,” or any procreative purposes whatsoever until after the fall (Gen. 3:20). The only task that is given the man and the woman in the passage regarding the purposes for which they are created is the mandate to keep and to guard the garden, and to obey the command of the Lord (Gen. 2:15-17).</p>
<p>(Now, the creation narrative of Gen. 1 does indeed contain a reference to procreation. In that context, though, man and woman are created simultaneously in the image of God and blessed <em>as a pair</em>, just as the animals are blessed, to “be fruitful and multiply” [Gen. 1:28]. Fruitfulness and reproduction are not unique to humankind, but part of the plant and animal world in which they exist. What the text emphasizes, rather, is the dominion that God grants to the humans [“subdue it” in v. 28]. Furthermore, there is no sense in Gen. 1 that fruitfulness and multiplication are functions given to women exclusively; it is something the human couple <em>shares</em>.)</p>
<h4 id="finally-in-contrast-to-nelsons-translation-adam-is-certainly-not-tasked-with-serving-as-a-gardener">Finally, in contrast to Nelson’s translation, Adam is certainly not tasked with serving as a “gardener.”</h4>
<p>As Johnson points out, because of its parallel to Num. 3:8 and other references to the temple, what’s being spoken of here is keeping and guarding the <em>the place where God’s presence dwells</em>.</p>
<p>This is priestly language describing a priestly vocation. And, once again, it is something Adam is not meant to do alone. It is precisely the work of preserving sacred space that Adam is unable to accomplish without Eve. In the vocation of tending to the place where God’s presence dwells, Eve is Adam’s “ally of the same kind” (<em>ezer kenegdo).</em></p>
<h4 id="now-in-fairness-to-johnson-and-nelson-they-are-not-doing-a-strictly-grammatical-and-historical-reading-of-gen-2">Now, in fairness to Johnson and Nelson, they are not doing a strictly grammatical and historical reading of Gen. 2.</h4>
<p>Instead, they are employing a typological reading, one clearly inspired, in my estimation, by <a href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/marriage-and-family/natural-family-planning/catholic-teaching/theology-of-the-body.cfm">Pope John Paul II’s “Theology of the Body</a>.”</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no problem with typological readings of Scripture in general. But, I do have a problem when a typological reading imposes something that is alien to, or directly at odds with, the most natural and straightforward interpretation of the sacred text.</p>
<p>And this, I believe, is one of those instances. Those of us committed to the authority of Scripture must, at the very least, allow Scripture to speak for itself before assigning to it typological meanings that go beyond the intent of the original author.</p>
<h4 id="before-moving-on-and-along-the-same-lines-i-want-to-offer-a-word-of-caution-to-those-inclined-to-agree-with-nelsons-interpretation-of-gen-2-and-the-theology-of-the-body-as-a-whole">Before moving on, and along the same lines, I want to offer a word of caution to those inclined to agree with Nelson’s interpretation of Gen. 2 and the “Theology of the Body” as a whole.</h4>
<p>The notion that, as Nelson says, “sexual difference serves to show the relation between God and creation,” with men imaging God (father, gardener, giver) and women imaging creation (life-giver, mother, receiver) has deep conceptual resonance with the <em>pagan</em> cosmology of the Ancient Near East.</p>
<p>In fact, it is this kind of Canaanite cosmology, which closely linked human sexuality and the deity, that the creation narratives of Genesis 1-2 are expressly denying.</p>
<p>In their desire to find a unified essentialist theology of gender in the scriptures, I fear many are extrapolating the analogies of Christ and the church, Yahweh and Israel, husband and wife, in ways that are deeply harmful—both for our theology proper and our theological anthropology.</p>
<p>I therefore encourage my sisters and brothers to think more critically about these kinds of claims and to consider carefully whether their conclusions are, indeed, in continuity with the scriptures and the great tradition of the Christian church.</p>
<h3 id="there-are-many-more-points-of-interpretive-disagreement-i-could-cite-between-nelsons-and-johnsons-responses-but-i-find-myself-constrained-by-time-and-space">There are many more points of interpretive disagreement I could cite between Nelson’s and Johnson’s responses, but I find myself constrained by time and space.</h3>
<p>Regarding the conclusions we draw from the Pauline corpus, like 1 Tim. 2:11-16, 1 Cor. 11:1-16; and 1 Cor. 14:34-35, I’ll simply say this: Nelson demonstrates precisely the kind of argumentation that Johnson rightly warns against—treating these texts simply as “knockdown verse[s]” against women’s ordination to the priesthood, rather than engaging carefully with St. Paul’s reasoning in its immediate and canonical context.</p>
<p>For instance, what does Paul mean about forbidding women to teach men (1 Tim. 2:12) when he assumes elsewhere that they will, in fact, do so? And, when they do, Paul says they should do so with their heads covered (1 Cor. 11:2-16) and in good order (1 Cor. 14:1-33)?</p>
<p>Whatever we are to make of this, it is by no means simple and straightforward. We should not insult our interlocutors by suggesting that it is.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-be-very-clear-about-my-position-i-do-not-support-the-ordination-of-women-to-the-priesthood-despite-the-bible-i-support-it-because-of-the-bible">I want to be very clear about my position: I do not support the ordination of women to the priesthood <em>despite</em> the Bible; I support it <em>because</em> of the Bible.</h2>
<p>And I am by no means alone in this. I encourage those who argue against women’s ordination to the priesthood to engage the works of a great many respected and orthodox biblical scholars whose research on this subject directly refutes many, if not all, of the interpretive points Nelson and Johnson raise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Craig Keener (the new president of the Evangelical Theological Society),</li>
<li>Scot McKnight,</li>
<li>Ben Witherington III,</li>
<li>Nijay Gupta,</li>
<li>Cynthia Long Westfall,</li>
<li>Lucy Peppiatt,</li>
<li>N.T. Wright,</li>
<li>Gordon Fee,</li>
<li>Richard Bauckham,</li>
<li>I. Howard Marshall,</li>
<li>and Anthony Thiselton, among many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, Scripture does not, in fact, define narrowly what men and women are ontologically, nor does it demarcate women’s and men’s functions based solely on their gender. Such notions have to be read into the text.</p>
<p>Instead, the scriptures provide an overarching vision for women and men as different, distinct, and mutually submissive partners in the Kingdom of God. This was God’s intention from the beginning and it is a partnership restored in the reign of God inaugurated by Jesus Christ. And this new creation is something the church gets to embody as an outpost of the Kingdom within this fallen world until our Lord returns.</p>
<h2 id="other-questionsissues">Other Questions/Issues</h2>
<p>As I said at the beginning, the interpretation of Scripture is not the only area within which we must adjudicate the question of women’s ordination to the priesthood.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, I think it will be helpful to acknowledge some of the many questions raised by Johnson’s and Nelson’s responses:</p>
<h3 id="on-the-subject-of-scripture-and-its-interpretation">On the subject of Scripture and its interpretation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>What does the narrative of Scripture have to say about the meaning of being created male and female? Does Scripture indeed teach discrete roles or functions in the world and Christ’s church based on gender?</li>
<li>Does the canon speak with one voice on the subject of women and women’s “roles”? Or is there discernible development/movement within the canon?</li>
<li>More specifically, is the New Covenant best understood as continuous or discontinuous with the Old Covenant in regard to ecclesial leadership; namely, the priesthood?</li>
<li>How are we to interpret the passages in the letters of St. Paul, which seem to restrict women in some instances (1 Tim. 2:11-15; 1 Cor. 11:1-16; 1 Cor. 14:34-35), while freeing them and assuming their leadership in other instances (1 Cor. 12:1-31; 1 Cor. 14:1-33; Gal. 3:28; Rom. 16:1-16; Phil. 4:2-3)? What is the best way to interpret these passages so as to make sense of all of the evidence in the canon?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-the-subject-of-the-tradition">On the subject of the tradition:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Does the great tradition of Christianity speak with one voice on the subject of women in leadership, particularly, sacramental leadership? If not, what do we make of dissenting voices or practices within the tradition?</li>
<li>What do we make of <a href="http://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030111106">recent findings</a> that suggest that significantly more expanded roles for women were operative in the earliest days of the church? Does this have any impact on our perspective on and interpretation of the tradition?</li>
<li>Does tradition need to be interpreted within its own contexts? Or are the voices of the tradition permitted to speak without regard to their own social and cultural norms (particularly in regard to their views of women)?</li>
<li>Along similar lines, are the conclusions of the early church fathers regarding women and women’s roles normative for Christians today? If so, why? And how so?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-the-subject-of-the-anglican-communions-relationship-to-other-catholic-bodies">On the subject of the Anglican Communion’s relationship to other catholic bodies:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are Anglicans mainly Protestant or mainly Catholic, or something else entirely? And what impact does that have on our theological method and church practice?</li>
<li>Are the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church on the matter of women in the priesthood normative for the Anglican Communion?</li>
<li>More specifically, are the teachings of Pope John Paul II, particularly his “Theology of the Body,” which are often brought to bear on this issue, to be understood as normative for Anglicans today?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-the-subject-of-theological-method">On the subject of theological method:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are arguments from natural law, upon which much of the “Theology of the Body” is based, appropriate within the Anglican theological tradition?</li>
<li>Is our conception of natural law context-free? Or, are our notions of what is “natural” in some way shaped by our social and cultural context—not to mention our fallenness and the fallenness of our world?</li>
<li>Should our biblical exegesis be constrained by the perspective of the church fathers? Or, is there room for <em>ecclesia semper reformanda</em> (“the church always being reformed”) within Anglican theological method?</li>
<li>Does the apparent work of the Holy Spirit in setting apart and empowering women for priestly ministry today—not just in the West, but in regions all over the world—have something to contribute to the discussion? Certainly, experience alone cannot be normative within the Anglican tradition, but can it be permitted a seat at the theological “table”?</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on, but I’ll stop here.</p>
<h2 id="the-point-is-this-johnson-nelson-and-i-disagree-on-the-matter-of-womens-ordination-to-the-priesthood-not-because-i-do-not-take-the-authority-of-scripture-seriously-i-most-certainly-do-but-because-we-have-different-answers-to-a-number-of-vitally-important-questions">The point is this: Johnson, Nelson, and I disagree on the matter of women’s ordination to the priesthood, not because I do not take the authority of Scripture seriously (I most certainly do), but because we have different answers to a number of vitally important questions.</h2>
<p>For instance, I do not accept the premise that Nelson’s version of gender essentialism is taught by Scripture, nor do I find the church fathers teaching the same.</p>
<p>As I tell my students, every text has to be interpreted. Whether we’re talking about the tradition or the scriptures, “nature” or the church fathers, all these “texts” must be interpreted. And since the Anglican tradition does not have a Magisterium like the Roman Catholic Church’s, which can declare an issue definitively settled for all time (i.e., <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1994/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_19940522_ordinatio-sacerdotalis.html">John Paul II’s apostolic letter, <em>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</em></a>), Anglicans must engage in the hard work of interpretation ever mindful of the fact that people of goodwill are going to disagree.</p>
<p>Moreover, this list of questions also makes clear that, because of the interplay of so many weighty matters (i.e., biblical exegesis and hermeneutics, historical and systematic theology, liturgical and sacramental theology, biology, sociology, and culture), the question of gender and its implications is probably one of the most complicated and challenging subjects facing the church today. This conversation is going to continue—as it should. And I hope we can continue to do so with humility and charity befitting sisters and brothers in Christ.</p>
<p>In some ways, it would be easier if we still lived in a time when <a href="http://willgwitt.org/theology/concerning-womens-ordination-the-argument-from-tradition-is-not-the-traditional-argument/">women were assumed to be physically, intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually inferior to men. Then, the argument would be moot, as it was for many years of the church’s history</a>. Obviously, inferior persons should not serve as priests in Christ’s church.</p>
<p>But we now know with certainty that women are <em>not</em> inherently inferior to men. Though essentially distinct in important ways—ways we are just beginning to understand—church leaders, biblical scholars, and theologians must consider carefully what these distinctions <em>mean.</em></p>
<p>Despite claims to the contrary, the meaning of gender difference is not, in fact, clear and obvious, and neither is the question of what impact that meaning should have on the structure of Christ’s body, the church.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my role as Managing Editor for AnglicanPastor.com, I’m realizing the need to develop some “rules for conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the tone that we’re after as “clarity and charity,” which is an excellent summary. However, to guide our blogposts and comments, I think we need something more detailed and concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” seem like excellent starting points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, if you have any further suggestions, please let me know in the comments!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my role as Managing Editor for AnglicanPastor.com, I’m realizing the need to develop some “rules for conversation.”</p>
<p>We describe the tone that we’re after as “clarity and charity,” which is an excellent summary. However, to guide our blogposts and comments, I think we need something more detailed and concrete.</p>
<p>With that in mind, “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” seem like excellent starting points.</p>
<p><strong>But, if you have any further suggestions, please let me know in the comments!</strong></p>
<h2 id="rapoports-rules">Rapoport’s Rules</h2>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/use-rapoports-rules-for-better-conversations-and-disagreements/">posted about these rules before on my blog</a>. Click that link for a bit more information. Here are the rules.</p>
<p>When critiquing someone else:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should <strong>attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”</strong></li>
<li>You should <strong>list any points of agreement</strong> (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</li>
<li>You should <strong>mention anything you have learned from your target.</strong></li>
<li>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of <strong>rebuttal or criticism</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adlers-advice">Adler’s Advice</h2>
<p>Rapoport’s Rules are an excellent start, but surely there’s more out there!</p>
<p>Mortimer Adler’s book, <em>How to Speak How to Listen</em> contains some practical advice in Chapter 11 on “How to Make Conversation Profitable and Pleasurable.”</p>
<p><em>(NOTE: Page numbers below are from the Scribd e-book. They might not perfectly coincide with the hardcover or paperback.)</em></p>
<h3 id="factorsobstacles">Factors/Obstacles</h3>
<p>First, Adler highlights four factors or obstacles that need to be recognized and overcome for a successful conversation to take place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: We must, of course, use it, but “it is a very imperfect medium of communication—cloudy, obscure, full of ambiguities and pitfalls of misunderstanding.” (136).</li>
<li><strong>Emotion</strong>(s): Perfectly fine in heart-to-heart talks, but “emotions are entirely out of place in impersonal conversations that have as their goal the achievement of better understanding and the attainment of agreement about the resolution of purely intellectual issues.” (138).</li>
<li><strong>Self-Knowledge</strong>: “Understanding one’s self is a necessary condition for understanding anyone else.” (138).</li>
<li><strong>Effort</strong>: “Saying what you mean is one of the hardest things in the world to do. Listening to what others say in order to discern what they mean is equally hard. Both call for expenditures of intellectual energy that many persons are loath to make.” (140).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Pick the right place and occasion for a conversation</strong>, one that provides sufficient time for carrying it on and one that is free from the annoyance of distractions that interrupt or divert it.” (140).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Know in advance what kind of conversation you are trying to have.</strong>” (141).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“For whatever kind of serious conversation it is to be, <strong>select the right people with whom to have it</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Don’t try to discuss everything with everybody. …</li>
<li>“Most important of all, never engage in the discussion of a problem with someone you know in advance has a closed mind on that subject.” (142).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Certain matters are undiscussable and, therefore, one should avoid discussing them</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“The familiar maxim, <em>de gustibus non disputandum est</em> [Latin: “about tastes, it should not be disputed”], is more often disobeyed than honored, and yet violating this rule always turns two-way talk into nothing more than an exchange of personal prejudices. …</li>
<li>“Only about matters concerning which objective truth can be ascertained is it worthwhile to engage in argument of one sort or another for the sake of ascertaining it.” (143–44).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t listen only to yourself</strong>.” (144).</p>
<ol>
<li>“All of us have had the experience of conversation that proceeds in the following manner. Brown speaks while Jones remains silent, not listening to what Brown says, but only waiting politely for Brown to finish, at which time Jones enters the conversation with a statement of something on his mind that may have no relation whatsoever to what Brown has just said. While Jones speaks, Brown also politely waits, but does not listen. When Jones finishes, Brown then expands on what he said earlier or talks about something else that in no way relates to what Jones has just expressed.</li>
<li>“They might just as well have been in different rooms talking to themselves, because that is the only person they have been listening to.” (144–45).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“A closely related rule calls on you to <strong>listen to a question with an effort to understand it before answering it, and then with an effort to address yourself to the question in the light of your understanding of it</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>“Many persons take questions as nothing more than signals for them to speak, uttering whatever happens to be on their mind at the moment, whether or not it has any relevance to the question that calls for their response.</li>
<li>“If you have any sense at all that you may not understand the question you have been asked, don’t try to answer it. Instead ask your interrogator to explain the question, to rephrase it in some way that makes it more intelligible to you.</li>
<li>“There is no point in trying to answer questions you do not completely understand. Keep at the task of reaching for that understanding before you attempt to answer.” (145).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“A parallel rule, if you are on the questioning rather than the answering end of a conversation, is to <strong>ask your questions as clearly and as intelligibly as possible</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“There is still one more rule about questions in relation to good serious conversation. <strong>Some people think that they are engaging in conversation when they ask another person one question after another, receiving each answer without commenting on it, and without any connection between the questions asked in sequence. This may be a form of interrogation that is useful under certain conditions and for certain purposes, but it is not a conversation in which the interchanges of two-way talk advance significantly from one point to another</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t interrupt while someone else is speaking</strong>.” (145).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Don’t be rude</strong> by engaging in a side conversation while someone to whom you should be listening is talking.</p>
<ol>
<li>“<strong>At the same time, don’t be too polite. One should always be civil in the tone and manner of one’s utterances, but excessive politeness should not restrain one from saying what is on one’s mind.</strong></li>
<li>“If you think what you have to say may be offensive, try to phrase it in such a way that giving offense is avoided, but do not clam up when what you have to say deserves saying.” (145-46).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Recognize that <strong>anything that takes time should have a beginning, a middle, and an end.</strong> This is as true of a conversation as of a play or a symphony. …</p>
<ol>
<li>“The beginning should set the stage for the conversation by focusing on the theme—the problem, the question, the subject to be discussed.</li>
<li>“The middle, which should run for a longer time, should be devoted to exploring the problem, the question, or subject and should elicit all the differences of opinion that are relevant to it, with support for these opinions to be given by argument.</li>
<li>“The end should bring the conversation to a conclusion—a decision reached if the conversation has a practical purpose, a position agreed upon if the matter is theoretical.</li>
<li>“If agreement is beyond reach, then the conclusion may involve suspended judgment and the tabling of the matter in question for further conversation, and perhaps resolution, at a later time.” (145–47).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommendations-for-impersonal-conversations">Recommendations for Impersonal Conversations</h3>
<h4 id="intellectual-rules">Intellectual Rules</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“If you are an active participant in a conversation or discussion, your first obligation is to <strong>focus on the question to be considered.</strong> What is the problem to be solved, the issue to be settled, the subject to be explored? <strong>If the matter is complex</strong> and has a number of component elements, those engaged in the conversation would be well advised to <strong>break it up into its parts, label them, and put them in some order.</strong>” (150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Stick to the issue.</strong> Stay within the framework of the subject under consideration, either as a whole or with respect to one or another of its parts. Don’t wander off and talk about something else or intrude irrelevancies into the course of the conversation.” (150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Stick to the issue or the point, <strong>but don’t beat it to death.</strong> Don’t stay on it forever. Keep moving on to the next point when this one has been sufficiently explored or discussed.” (151).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Individuals not only bring unacknowledged assumptions to a conversation in which they are engaged, they also take part in it without knowing what their blind spots are—matters concerning which they lack understanding and have difficulty in attaining.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>“Like unacknowledged assumptions, blind spots can ruin a conversation or at least prevent the minds engaged in it from really meeting.”</li>
<li>“Be on the alert to <strong>recognize when you are failing to understand something and press for help in understanding it</strong>.</li>
<li>“You should <strong>be aware that you have certain preconceptions and assumptions, and try to dredge them up from the recesses of your mind and lay them on the table for everyone to examine</strong>.</li>
<li>“Since few conversations begin at the beginning and different things are taken for granted by the persons talking with one another, the rule might better be stated as follows. <strong>Ask your companions to grant the assumptions you wish to make, and state your own assumptions when it comes their turn to ask you for them.</strong>” (151–152).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Avoid the most obvious fallacies.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>“<strong>Never argue about facts; look them up</strong> if you wish to settle a difference of opinion about them.</li>
<li>“<strong>Never cite authorities as if the citation of them were conclusive.</strong>”</li>
<li><strong>Don’t argue <em>ad hominem</em></strong>, “attacking persons rather than attacking the point being considered.”</li>
<li>“When the conversation is theoretical rather than practical, when it is concerned with getting at the truth about a certain matter, then <strong>taking a vote should never be regarded as settling the question in issue.</strong>”</li>
<li>“<strong>Beware of examples.</strong> They often prove too much or too little and they are seldom perfectly relevant. … Examples can be useful, but only to illustrate what you are saying, never to prove it.”</li>
<li>“Examples should be treated like assumptions. Just as assumptions should be allowed to exert whatever force they have only with everyone’s explicit acknowledgment and consent, so <strong>examples should stand only if everyone sees their relevance and is aware that they are being used to illustrate a point, not to prove it.</strong>” (153–56).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="emotional-rules">Emotional Rules</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“catch yourself or the other person getting angry. The signs that this is happening are many and various:</p>
<ol>
<li>you or he start to shout;</li>
<li>you or he become repetitious, raising your voice with each reiteration of the point;</li>
<li>you or he become overpositive, expressing this by pounding the table or by other forms of gesturing;</li>
<li>you or he indulge in sarcasm, in teasing, in baiting, or in getting the other’s argument laughed at;</li>
<li>or either of you resorts to the kind of irrelevant ad hominems mentioned above.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>When you find yourself getting annoyed, angry, or overexcited in the course of an argument, leave the room and give yourself time to cool off.</strong>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Do not allow an impersonal discussion to become a personal quarrel.</strong> Argument is not aggression. There is no point at all in trying to win an argument simply by putting your opponent down or beating him up.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<strong>Be aware of the results of emotional disorder on your own part.</strong> … There is certainly no point in winning an argument for personal or emotional reasons that impel you to try to get the better of the other person when your mind either knows now or will recognize later that he was right and you were wrong.” (156–57).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-meeting-of-minds-chapter-12-highlights">“The Meeting of Minds” (Chapter 12, Highlights)</h3>
<h4 id="you-must-understand-before-you-can-agree-or-disagree">You must understand before you can agree or disagree.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The first rule to be followed is this. <strong>Do not disagree—or, for that matter, do not agree—with anyone else unless you are sure you understand the position the other person is taking.</strong> To disagree before you understand is impertinent. To agree is inane.</p>
<p>To make sure that you understand, before you disagree or agree, <strong>exercise the courtesy of asking the other person the following question: “Do I understand you to say that . . . ?”</strong> Fill in the blank by phrasing in your own words what you think you hear the other person saying. <strong>He may respond to this by saying to you, “No, that is not what I said or not what I meant. My position is as follows.”</strong> Then, after the other person has restated his position for you, you should once again try to state in your own words what you have understood the other to say. If the other still dissents from your interpretation, <strong>you must continue with this question and answer procedure until the other tells you that you have at last caught the point, that you understand him precisely as he wishes to be understood. Only then do you have the grounds indispensable for intelligent and reasonable disagreement or agreement.</strong>” (159–60).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="fully-understood-disagreement-and-fully-understood-agreement">Fully understood disagreement and fully understood agreement.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“Understanding with disagreement—fully understood disagreement—constitutes a minimal meeting of minds. A more complete meeting of minds consists in understanding with agreement—fully understood agreement.” (161).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="there-are-4-kinds-of-genuine-disagreement">There are 4 kinds of genuine disagreement.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you find yourself in genuine disagreement with the position taken by another, you should be able to explain the grounds of your disagreement, by saying one or more of the following things.</p>
<ol>
<li>“I think you hold that position because <strong>you are uninformed</strong> about certain facts or reasons that have a critical bearing on it.” Then be prepared to point out the information you think the other lacks and which, if possessed, would result in a change of mind.</li>
<li>“I think you hold that position because <strong>you are misinformed</strong> about matters that are critically relevant.” Then be prepared to indicate the mistakes the other has made, which, if corrected, would lead the other to abandon the position taken.</li>
<li>“I think you are sufficiently well informed and have a firm grasp of the evidence and reasons that support your position, but <strong>you have drawn the wrong conclusions from your premises because you have made mistakes in reasoning</strong>. You have made fallacious inferences.” Then be ready to point out those logical errors which, if corrected, would bring the other person to a different conclusion.</li>
<li>“I think you have made none of the foregoing errors and that you have proceeded by sound reasoning from adequate grounds for the conclusion you have reached, <strong>but I also think that your thinking about the subject is incomplete</strong>. You should have gone further than you did and reached other conclusions that somewhat alter or qualify the one you did reach.” Then be able to point out what these other conclusions are and how they alter or qualify the position taken by the person with whom you disagree.” (162–63).</li>
</ol>

      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2019 16:54:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/quit-claiming-that-we-mutualists-egalitarians-dont-take-the-bible-or-tradition-seriously/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing debate about women’s ordination (in the Anglican realm and beyond), I keep hearing oversimplified claims from hierarchicalists (or “complementarians,” but that’s not the most helpful term in this debate) that they have the &lt;em&gt;entirety&lt;/em&gt; of the Bible and Church tradition on their side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we mutualists (or “egalitarians,” but that’s not the most helpful term in this debate), it is argued, have arrived at our positions for various reasons—perhaps capitulation to liberal cultural trends and hermeneutical methods—but not because we’ve read Scripture or studied the history of the Church very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ongoing debate about women’s ordination (in the Anglican realm and beyond), I keep hearing oversimplified claims from hierarchicalists (or “complementarians,” but that’s not the most helpful term in this debate) that they have the <em>entirety</em> of the Bible and Church tradition on their side.</p>
<p>Therefore, we mutualists (or “egalitarians,” but that’s not the most helpful term in this debate), it is argued, have arrived at our positions for various reasons—perhaps capitulation to liberal cultural trends and hermeneutical methods—but not because we’ve read Scripture or studied the history of the Church very carefully.</p>
<p>(<em>Related: See <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2017/06/19/egalitarians-take-bible-seriously/">J.W. Wartick’s post, “Do Egalitarians Take the Bible Seriously?,” over at Scot McKnight’s Jesus Creed blog.</a>)</em></p>
<p>This is patently false. It is a refusal to admit the complexities of this debate. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity">violation of the hermeneutical principle of charity</a>.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that this uncharitable claim that the mutualists don’t have a high view of Scripture or Church tradition is what Will Witt has labeled a <a href="http://willgwitt.org/theology/non-theological-arguments-against-the-ordination-of-women/">“non-theological argument against the ordination of women.”</a></p>
<p>NOTE: I am *not* suggesting that hierarchicalist’s <em>Scriptural arguments</em> are non-theological. To do so would be exactly the same kind of uncharitable dismissal that I have a problem with. Each scriptural argument, each passage in question deserves careful debate.</p>
<p>But what I am claiming is that it is a serious mistake—one which derails the possibility for a legitimate conversation to continue—for hierarchicalists to simply ignore or impugn the careful work of mutualist biblical scholars and theologians.</p>
<p>Hierarchicalists ought not to claim that the mountain of biblical, historical, and theological work that’s been done in support of mutualism doesn’t at least represent an attempt to take the Bible and tradition seriously.</p>
<p>Consider, as a starting point, the mutualist work in the following resources.</p>
<p>First, if you don’t have a lot of time, then just look through Pierce and Groothius (editors), <a href="https://amzn.to/2ShMk6H"><em>Discovering Biblical Equality: Complementarity Without Hierarchy,</em></a> Second Edition (InterVarsity Press, 2005). That’s a good one-stop-shop if you’d like to actually engage with biblical and theological mutualist arguments, (instead of pretending like they don’t exist or impugning their motives).</p>

<p>Are hierarchicalists free to disagree with the mutualists on particular points and texts? Of course!</p>
<p>As a mutualist, I will freely admit that this is a complicated debate. Because neither side has 100% certain, knock-down arguments for their position, both sides would benefit from charitable, robust engagement.</p>
<p>But, for the sake of that charitable, robust engagement, please quit claiming that we mutualists don’t care about the Bible or Church history. That’s every bit as unfair and uncharitable as if we mutualists claimed that all hierarchicalists are misogynists.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship, there is perhaps no greater conundrum than the meaning of what Bonhoeffer called Barth’s “Offenbarungspositivismus” (“positivism of revelation” or “revelatory positivism”) in his &lt;em&gt;Letters and Papers from Prison&lt;/em&gt; (DBWE 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, before we proceed, please note that Bonhoeffer meant something very particular by “religion” in his prison letters. For an overview of how Bonhoeffer and Barth differed on the meaning of “religion,” and what that means for how we interpret their theological critiques of religion, please see my essay: &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/to-be-or-not-to-be-religious-a-clarification-of-karl-barths-and-dietrich-bonhoeffers-divergence-and-convergence-regarding-religion/&#34;&gt;“To Be or Not To Be Religious: A Clarification of Karl Barth’s and Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Divergence and Convergence Regarding Religion.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship, there is perhaps no greater conundrum than the meaning of what Bonhoeffer called Barth’s “Offenbarungspositivismus” (“positivism of revelation” or “revelatory positivism”) in his <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em> (DBWE 8).</p>
<p><em>Now, before we proceed, please note that Bonhoeffer meant something very particular by “religion” in his prison letters. For an overview of how Bonhoeffer and Barth differed on the meaning of “religion,” and what that means for how we interpret their theological critiques of religion, please see my essay: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/to-be-or-not-to-be-religious-a-clarification-of-karl-barths-and-dietrich-bonhoeffers-divergence-and-convergence-regarding-religion/">“To Be or Not To Be Religious: A Clarification of Karl Barth’s and Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Divergence and Convergence Regarding Religion.”</a></em></p>
<p>Anyways, here’s Bonhoeffer’s first mention of positivism of revelation, in an April 30, 1944 letter to Eberhard Bethge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can Christ become Lord of the religionless as well? Is there such a thing as a religionless Christian? If religion is only the garb in which Christianity is clothed—and this garb has looked very different in different ages—what then is religionless Christianity? <strong>Barth, who is the only one to have begun thinking along these lines, nevertheless did not pursue these thoughts all the way, did not think them through, but ended up with a positivism of revelation, which in the end essentially remained a restoration.</strong> For the working person or any person who is without religion, nothing decisive has been gained here. (DBWE 8:363–64, emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the editors note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This reproach, “positivism of revelation,” raised here for the first time against Karl Barth (cf. also 3/139, p. 373, and 3/161, p. 429), is consistently preceded by an appreciation for Barth’s critique of religion (for example, 3/139, p. 373: “Barth was the first theologian … to begin the critique of religion”). However, the remarks about “nonreligious interpretation” and “arcane discipline” show that “positivism of revelation” is a programmatic term indicating that in his critique of religion, Bonhoeffer draws other consequences. For the origin of the concept “positivism of revelation” and its significance as a demarcating formula in theology, see Krause, “Dietrich Bonhoeffer,” in Theologische Realenzyklopädie, 64n1; Feil, Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 175–177, with reference to DBWE 6:376–78; Pangritz, Karl Barth in the Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 76–87; Wüstenberg, Theology of Life, 60–65. (DBWE 8:364n17).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his May 5, 1944 letter to Bethge, Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What matters is not the beyond but this world, how it is created and preserved, is given laws, reconciled, and renewed. What is beyond this world is meant, in the gospel, to be there for this world—not in the anthropocentric sense of liberal, mystical, pietistic, ethical theology, but in the biblical sense of the creation and the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. <strong>Barth was the first theologian—to his great and lasting credit—to begin the critique of religion, but he then put in its place a positivist doctrine of revelation that says, in effect, “like it or lump it.” Whether it’s the virgin birth, the Trinity, or anything else, all are equally significant and necessary parts of the whole, which must be swallowed whole or not at all. That’s not biblical. There are degrees of cognition and degrees of significance.</strong> That means an “arcane discipline” must be reestablished, through which the mysteries of the Christian faith are sheltered against profanation. <strong>The positivism of revelation is too easygoing, since in the end it sets up a law of faith and tears up what is—through Christ’s becoming flesh!—a gift for us. Now the church stands in the place of religion—that in itself is biblical—but the world is left to its own devices, as it were, to rely on itself. That is the error.</strong> At the moment I am thinking about how the concepts of repentance, faith, justification, rebirth, and sanctification should be reinterpreted in a “worldly” way—in the Old Testament sense and in the sense of John 1:14. I’ll write you more about it. (DBWE 8:373, emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we proceed, I’ll note that “Now the church stands in the place of religion” is “An der Stelle der Religion steht nun die Kirche” (DBW 8:416) in the original German. I still can’t figure out if this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The church is a part of the religious sphere.</li>
<li>OR: Now the church stands in religion’s spot, in religion’s stead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, finally, in his June 8, 1944 letter to Bethge, Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barth was the first to recognize the error of all these attempts (which were basically all still sailing in the wake of liberal theology, without intending to do so) in that they all aim to save some room for religion in the world or over against the world. He led the God of Jesus Christ forward to battle against religion, πνεῦμα against σάρξ. This remains his greatest merit (the second edition of The Epistle to the Romans, despite all the neo-Kantian eggshells!). Through his later Dogmatics he has put the church in a position to carry this distinction in principle all the way through. <strong>It was not in his ethics that he eventually failed, as is often said—his ethical observations, so far as they exist, are as important as his dogmatic ones—but in the nonreligious interpretation of theological concepts he gave no concrete guidance, either in dogmatics or ethics. Here he reaches his limit, and that is why his theology of revelation has become positivist, a “positivism of revelation,” as I call it.</strong> To a great extent the Confessing Church now has forgotten all about Barth’s approach and lapsed from positivism into conservative restoration. Its significance is that it holds fast to the great concepts of Christian theology, but it appears to be exhausting itself gradually in the process. Certainly these concepts contain the elements of genuine prophecy (which include the claim to the truth as well as mercy, as you mentioned) and of genuine ritual, and only to that extent does the message of the Confessing Church get attention, a hearing—and rejection. But both remain undeveloped, remote, because they lack interpretation. … As for Bultmann, he seems to have sensed Barth’s limitation somehow, but misunderstands it in the sense of liberal theology, and thus falls into typical liberal reductionism (the “mythological” elements in Christianity are taken out, thus reducing Christianity to its “essence”). <strong>My view, however, is that the full content, including the “mythological” concepts, must remain—the New Testament is not a mythological dressing up of a universal truth, but this mythology (resurrection and so forth) is the thing itself!—but that these concepts must now be interpreted in a way that does not make religion the condition for faith (cf. the περιτομή in Paul!). Only then, in my opinion, is liberal theology overcome (which still determines even Barth, if only in a negative way), but at the same time the question it asks is really taken up and answered (which is not the case with the Confessing Church’s positivism of revelation!).</strong> The fact that the world has come of age is no longer an occasion for polemics and apologetics, but is now actually better understood than it understands itself, namely, from the gospel and from Christ. (DBWE 8:428–31).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for the primary texts in question when it comes to the issue of Offenbarungspositivismus. However, secondary texts with proposed explanations of the positivism of revelation have proliferated since 1944!</p>
<p>Here’s how Tom Greggs summarizes the state of the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is the scope for a monograph which attended singularly to the vast array of interpretations scholars have offered with regard to the way in which one should understand Bonhoeffer’s three word (one in German) charge. Indeed, there is almost as much (if not more) reflection on this than the meaning of religionlessness and non-religious interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make what follows easier to read, I’ve broken it up into bullet points:</p>
<ul>
<li>For some theologians, the charge is aimed more at Barthians and the Confessing Church than Barth himself.</li>
<li>Others see it as arising from a degree of misunderstanding on the part of Bonhoeffer of Barth’s purpose. For others, it revolves around a shift towards existential thinking on Bonhoeffer’s part, compared to Barth’s overarching systematic principle of christology which swallows up all else.</li>
<li>Still others consider the meaning to relate to the distinctive christological method of Bonhoeffer compared to the trinitarian method of Barth.</li>
<li>Some have suggested the ultimately positive role of religion in Barth in terms of leading humans to grace, or the philosophical distinction between a theologian who is influenced primarily by Feuerbach, Freud and Marx (Barth), compared to one influenced primarily by Nietzsche (Bonhoeffer).</li>
<li>Others point to the influence of the philosopher, Wilhelm Dilthey, on Bonhoeffer during the period of his prison writings.</li>
<li>For some, the issue is the dominant influence of Luther on Bonhoeffer compared to Calvin on Barth, particularly over the issue of the <em>extra Calvinisticum</em>.</li>
<li>Still others see the issue as resting in the positive meaning of ‘religion’ for the two theologians, with Bonhoeffer adopting an ‘operational or behavioural’ concept of religion in comparison to a ‘morphological or institutional’ one.</li>
<li>For others, it is Barth’s ‘all or nothing’ approach that should be emphasized, especially around the issue of the virgin birth, as being at the heart of ‘positivism of revelation’.</li>
<li>For others, the matter is Barth’s inability to relate revelation to the world, or his strong distinction of the church from the world.</li>
<li>At stake in some interpretations is Bonhoeffer’s unpreparedness to create a theory of religion (and his critique of Barth’s doing so), and the related issue of religion being a harmatological concept for Barth compared to an historical concept for Bonhoeffer.</li>
<li>Still others analyse the distinction between Bonhoeffer and Barth in terms of different emphases in their theological approach—on the secondary objectivity of God in the former, and the primary objectivity of God in the latter. (<em>Theology against Religion: Constructive Dialogues with Bonhoeffer and Barth</em>, 56–58.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Greggs himself then proceeds to offer an explanation that situates Bonhoeffer’s accusation vis-a-vis Schleiermacher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One possible way of understanding Bonhoeffer’s charge against Barth is to see it in relation to the theological father of liberalism, Friedrich Schleiermacher. It may well be that Bonhoeffer believed that Barth was ultimately influenced (if negatively) by liberal theology, and that Barth was still allowing his work to be defined by the confines of liberal thought. Considering this point might help to unpack what Bonhoeffer meant by positivism of revelation, and to demonstrate that Bonhoeffer is seeking to be even more Barthian than Barth, rather than engaging in a different agenda. (Greggs, 61).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s the payoff of doing so?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, then, does this mean for Bonhoeffer’s charge against Barth of ‘positivism of revelation’? Firstly, it relates to the accusation of the ‘take it or leave it’ nature of revelation which, according to Bonhoeffer, exists in Barth’s work. Positivism points to the givenness of the individual instantiation of Christianity, its unique stand-aloneness which separates it not only from other religions but also from the world. Secondly, and more fiercely, it seems that Bonhoeffer’s term suggests a logical flaw in Barth’s doctrine of revelation which separates it off from all other potential engagements external to itself, creating a self-enclosed circle, self-sufficient in its entirety. The argument of this would go thus: the positive aspect of a religion is its individuality and distinctiveness from all else. The cause of this (according to Schleiermacher) is revelation. Barth seems to agree with Schleiermacher in his presentation to some degree, since revelation contradicts religion. But, for Barth, the very thing which is distinctive is not only caused by revelation, but is revelation. In other words, according to Bonhoeffer’s critique of ‘positivism of revelation’, Barth says something akin to ‘revelation makes Christianity a positive (unique) religion, and what is revealed is that Christianity is a religion which arises in some way out of revelation: the positivism of the Christianity, which is caused by revelation, is, thereby, revelation.’ Thus, revelation, rather than being the means of establishing the distinctiveness of Christianity becomes the beginning and the end. (Greggs, 63).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s Greggs’ assessment of Bonhoeffer’s critique:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, this presentation fails to do full justice to §17 of Church Dogmatics. As has been seen in Chapter 2, it is not a concept of revelation or even grace which is the Aufhebung of religion, but Jesus Christ Himself. The trueness of Christian religion does not rest in revelation or grace, but its religion is contradicted in the same way in which sin is contradicted, not simply by the revelation of revelation, but by the revelation of God in the person of Jesus Christ. To a degree, therefore, the charge rests on an insensitive reading of Barth, but nevertheless that reading does not stop Bonhoeffer from sensing that Barth is on the path that he, too, should walk along: it means only that Bonhoeffer does not realize how closely and how much in step he and Barth are walking, and, given the on going and dynamic nature of both of their works (see above), this can hardly be a charge of mis-representation. Bonhoeffer builds upon Barth’s indicative description of human religion and optatively hopes for a Christianity which can become religionless: for Bonhoeffer, there is the hope that religion need not be the ‘given’ (positive) for theology. He charges Barth with the task of moving further away from Schleiermacher’s categories—otherwise put, with the task of becoming more intensely Barth. The critique is not a critique against Barth’s constructive work, but a critique of the continued Schleiermacherian categories which Barth still works with as a background: Bonhoeffer does not want less Barth; he wants more. (Greggs, 63-64).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blogpost isn’t the place to evaluate all of these proposals. Suffice it to say that I think that (1) no one is really sure what Bonhoeffer meant by positivism of revelation and (2) the conversation about the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship would be better off focusing on Barth and Bonhoeffer’s biblical engagement (instead of continuing to speculate about what Bonhoeffer’s enigmatic accusation meant).</p>

&lt;li&gt;Summary and Conclusion (5,000 words)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after doing survey work, and spending most of the previous academic year working on Barth and Bonhoeffer’s reading of Genesis 1–3, I’ve decided to narrow my focus down to Genesis 1–3 and the Sermon on the Mount.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="im-narrowing-my-focus-to-genesis-13-and-the-sermon-on-the-mount">I’m narrowing my focus to Genesis 1–3 and the Sermon on the Mount.</h2>
<p>Originally, my dissertation proposal cast a very wide net. I was going to have the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction (5,000 words)</li>
<li>Chapter 1: Creation and Fall (Genesis 1–3) (16,000 words)</li>
<li>Chapter 2: The Prophets (16,000 words)</li>
<li>Chapter 3: The Gospels (16,000 words)</li>
<li>Chapter 4: The Epistle to the Romans (16,000 words)</li>
<li>Chapter 5: Completing the Biblical Critique of Religion (16,000 words)</li>
<li>Summary and Conclusion (5,000 words)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, after doing survey work, and spending most of the previous academic year working on Barth and Bonhoeffer’s reading of Genesis 1–3, I’ve decided to narrow my focus down to Genesis 1–3 and the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<h2 id="for-one-thing-bonhoeffer-doesnt-have-that-much-material-in-any-one-place-on-the-book-of-romans">For one thing, Bonhoeffer doesn’t have that much material in any one place on the book of Romans.</h2>
<p>This is, admittedly, interesting in and of itself. Why, after being so clearly inspired by Barth’s theological interpretation of Scripture in his <em>Romans</em> commentary, did Bonhoeffer decide to devote his first theological interpretation of Scripture to Genesis 1–3?</p>
<h2 id="the-same-thing-is-basically-true-when-it-comes-to-the-prophets-especially-the-book-of-the-twelve">The same thing is basically true when it comes to the Prophets, especially the Book of the Twelve.</h2>
<p>Bonhoeffer, it’s true, does have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Old Testament Examination on Amos 9” in <em>The Young Bonhoeffer</em> (DBWE 9:447ff.).</li>
<li>“The Tragedy of the Prophetic and Its Lasting Meaning” in <em>Barcelona, Berlin, New York</em> (DBWE 10:325ff.).</li>
<li>“Poem ‘Jonah’” in <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em> (DBWE 8:547ff.).q</li>
</ul>
<p>However, he’s got nothing that comes close to the length and level of detail that are evident in his handlings of Genesis 1–3 (in <em>Creation and Fall</em>) and the Sermon on the Mount (in <em>Discipleship</em>).</p>
<h2 id="as-for-barth-the-book-of-romans-is-undeniably-relevant-for-his-theological-critique-of-religion">As for Barth, the book of Romans is undeniably relevant for his theological critique of religion.</h2>
<p>However, I plan to address this in my dissertation when I’m talking about the importance of being precise when we’re defining the term “religion.”</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-minor-prophets">What about the Minor Prophets?</h2>
<p>Well, Barth does cite the Book of the Twelve throughout his works. But, as far as his main “theological critique of religion” passages go, there’s not very much to go off of.</p>
<p>The exception seems to be Barth’s discussion of Amos in CD §17.3 (“True Religion”). Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold it is a stiffnecked people” (v. 9). That is revealed religion as such. That is the actuality of revealed religion. That is revealed religion as seen for a moment in abstraction from the grace of revelation. And that was how above all the prophet Amos saw it. He described the sacrifices offered to Yahweh at Bethel and Gilgal by the bitter term “scandals” (transgressions R.V. 4:4), He warned them: “Seek not Bethel nor enter into Gilgal” (5:5). In the name of Yahweh he proclaimed: “I hate, I despise your feasts and will not smell your solemn assemblies. Yea though ye offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings I will not accept them, neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs: for I will not heed the melody of thy viols” (5:21–23). In the most bitter earnest he flings the question: “Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?” (5:25). He also raises a question which relativises the whole of Israel’s existence in a devastating way: “Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the Lord. Have I not brought up Israel out of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?” (9:7). In the light of all this we can quite understand why the priest Amaziah thought that he ought to denounce this man to the king as a “rebel,” and to expel him from the royal temple of Bethel (7:10f.). It is equally significant that Amos expressly refuses to be a prophet or of the prophetic guild (7:14f.). With Amos there seems to open up an irreconcilable gulf between revelation and the religion of revelation (CD I/2, 328).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as an aside, Barth has an extended discussion of Amos in CD IV/2 (445–52). It might be interesting to compare Barth and Bonhoeffer on Amos, using Bonhoeffer’s “The Tragedy of the Prophetic…” lecture and Barth’s CD discussions as starting points.</p>
<p>However, I now plan to discuss Amos and the Book of the Twelve in the context of my constructive chapter. It strikes me as odd that Barth and Bonhoeffer didn’t do more to explicitly tie their theological critiques of religion to the Minor Prophets. Given the starting points that we have for their interpretations of the Minor Prophets, how might they have used the Book of the Twelve to advance their theological critiques of religions? Is there anything in the Minor Prophets that would critique or at least nuance Barth and Bonhoeffer when it comes to religion?</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-gospels">What about the Gospels?</h2>
<p>OK, so I’ve dealt with my originally proposed chapters on the Prophets and Romans. What about the Gospels? Well, I originally cast the net that broadly because Bonhoeffer mentions a litany of Gospel passages in a prison letter to Bethge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This being pulled along into the—messianic—suffering of God in Jesus Christ happens in the NT in various ways: when the disciples are called to follow him, in table fellowship with sinners, through “conversions” in the narrower sense of the word (Zacchaeus), through the action of the woman “who was a sinner” (done without any confession of sin taking place) in Luke 7, through the healing of the sick (see above Matt. 8:17), through receiving the children. The shepherds stand [at] the manger just as do the wise men from the East, not as “converted sinners,” but simply because they are drawn to the manger (by the star) just as they are. The centurion at Capernaum, who makes no confession of sin at all, is held up as an example of faith (cf. Jairus). p 482 The rich young man is “loved” by Jesus. The courtier in Acts 8, Cornelius (Acts 10), are anything but persons in desperate straits. Nathanael is “an Israelite in whom there is no deceit” (John 1:47), and finally there are Joseph of Arimathea and the women at the tomb. The one thing they all have in common is their sharing in the suffering of God in Christ. That is their “faith.” There is nothing about a religious method; the “religious act” is always something partial, whereas “faith” is something whole and involves one’s whole life. Jesus calls not to a new religion but to life (DBWE 8:481–82).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oddly enough, however, Bonhoeffer rarely mentioned any of these Gospel passages elsewhere in his writings. The main exception, of course, it the call of the disciples, which (as the editors of <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em> note) Bonhoeffer discusses in <em>Discipleship</em> (DBWE 4), pages 57–76.</p>
<p>As is well-known, Bonhoeffer’s explanation of the call to/of discipleship is intricately tied to his exposition of the Sermon on the Mount. In fact, no other passage of Scripture played as large of a role in Bonhoeffer’s life and thought. So, without discounting the importance of other passages in the Gospels, a “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” project really can’t get away with neglecting the Sermon on the Mount. And I believe that there will be enough material in the Sermon on the Mount to sustain a chapter (at least) of the dissertation, instead of devoting a chapter to “Gospels” in general.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-barth-have-to-say-about-the-sermon-on-the-mount">What did Barth have to say about the Sermon on the Mount?</h2>
<p>At first glance, honestly, it would seem that the Sermon on the Mount played a larger role in Bonhoeffer’s life and thought than it did in Barth’s. This very well might be true, but it’s important to remember that Barth did not completely neglect the Sermon.</p>
<p>As Grieb notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barth lectured on the Sermon on the Mount at Göttingen in the summer of 1925 and again at Bonn during the winter of 1933-34. But, unlike Bonhoeffer, he never wrote a treatise on it, although there are numerous references to the Sermon in his Ethics and especially in the Church Dogmatics. The longest of these is about fifteen pages of small print in II/2 from 686 to 700. Under the heading in section 38, “The Command as the Decision of God,” Barth deals first with “The Sovereignty of the Divine Decision,” “The Definiteness of the Divine Decision,” and finally, “The Goodness of the Divine Decision. It is within that second section, “The Definiteness of the Divine Decision,” that we find Earth’s discussion of the Sermon on the Mount, after a lengthy preliminary discussion… (A Katherine Grieb, “‘Living Righteousness’: Karl Barth and the Sermon on the Mount,” in Thy Word Is Truth: Barth on Scripture, ed. George Hunsinger (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2012), 98–99).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of Peter Zocher, director of the Karl Barth-Archiv in Basel, Switzerland, I’ve been given access to the manuscript of Barth’s 1925 Sermon on the Mount lectures and the typescript of his 1933–34 lectures. These lectures, along with Barth’s discussion of the Sermon on the Mount in CD II/2 and elsewhere, will provide a good foundation, on the Barth side of things, for a comparative and critical reading of Barth and Bonhoeffer on the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<h2 id="ultimately-the-gap-that-im-trying-to-fill-with-my-dissertation-is-barth-bonhoeffer-and-the-bible">Ultimately, the gap that I’m trying to fill with my dissertation is “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible.”</h2>
<p>That is, I want to take a closer look at Barth and Bonhoeffer’s handling of Scripture in order to make better sense of the “Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship.” I’m trying to follow John Webster’s suggestion that “rather than pursuing questions about positivism of revelation or about the worldly and ethical, light can be shed on the relation of Bonhoeffer and Barth by looking at the place of the interpretation of Scripture in their respective theologies” (<em>Word and Church</em>, 88).</p>
<p>Now, the immediate challenge that a “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” project faces is the amount of material. Both Barth and Bonhoeffer (especially Barth, because he lived longer and wrote more) wrote copious amounts of material on the biblical text. How would you go about covering this in 100,000 words, footnotes included? (That’s the word count I’m working with for my dissertation at Wheaton. Thankfully, this doesn’t include the bibliography!)</p>
<p>So, I need some kind of delimiter, something that helps me focus on a particular subset of Barth and Bonhoeffer’s biblical material. For various reasons, I’ve chosen the theological critique of religion as my delimiter/focus/filter.</p>
<p>For one thing, as I wrote in <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">my “elevator pitch” for the dissertation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My project traces its origins to a single classroom discussion question in the Spring of 2015. The question was this: “In what ways is Bonhoeffer’s understanding of religion similar to, and different from, that of Barth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This discussion question led me to write a paper that I would later use as my writing sample when applying to PhD programs: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/to-be-or-not-to-be-religious-a-clarification-of-karl-barths-and-dietrich-bonhoeffers-divergence-and-convergence-regarding-religion/">“To Be or Not To Be Religious: A Clarification of Karl Barth’s and Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Divergence and Convergence Regarding Religion.”</a></p>
<p>Here’s an abstract for that paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether Barth and Bonhoeffer share a common theological critique of religion has been subject to intense scholarly debate. To answer this question, we need first to ask another: What did Barth and Bonhoeffer mean by the term “religion”? I propose that, although Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s definitions of religion diverge, their critiques of religion converge. Barth developed a systematic/dialectical concept of religion as self-justification, which the early Bonhoeffer inherited. However, in prison, Bonhoeffer developed a historical/psychological definition of religion as an inward and partial approach to human life. We must realize that these are two different definitions of religion, lest we compare apples to oranges, as it were, and conclude that Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s critiques of religion also diverged.</p>
<p>Once we realize the divergent definitions, we can see the convergent critiques of a particular essence of religion: the self-justifying projection of a deity – a projection which calls for theological analysis. That is, for both Barth and Bonhoeffer, at the heart of “religion” is the impulse to posit and make room for a “God,” in order to secure our own identities by means of and over against this deity. Although religion, thus understood, is inescapable, it is not constitutive of our humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now plan to expand my work in that paper to the first body chapter of my dissertation, which I will devote to the pitfalls and potentials involved in defining “religion,” perhaps the slipperiest of all theological terms!</p>
<h2 id="so-i-intend-to-focus-on-three-main-things-in-this-barth-bonhoeffer-and-the-bible-dissertation">So, I intend to focus on three main things in this Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible dissertation.</h2>
<ol>
<li>What Barth and Bonhoeffer meant, precisely, by “<strong>religion</strong>.”</li>
<li>How they interpreted <strong>Genesis 1–3</strong>, especially the “<strong>knowledge of good and evil</strong>,” and how these things relate to their theological critiques of religion.</li>
<li>How they interpreted the <strong>Sermon on the Mount</strong>, and how this relates to Barth and Bonhoeffer’s interpretations of the knowledge of good and evil and religion.</li>
</ol>
<p>At least, that’s the plan at this point!</p>

Inspire them to spend and be spent for the sake of the Gospel, and make them holy and loving servants and shepherds of the flock for whom you shed your most precious blood.

<p>I’m getting ordained to the priesthood tomorrow, and I’m both humbled and honored to serve Christ’s Church in this way.</p>
<p>Do I feel inherently worthy to be a <em>presbyter</em>? No.</p>
<p>Me, a 28-year-old, an <em>elder</em>?</p>
<p>But I do feel called.</p>
<p>I feel called to “spend and be spent for the sake of the Gospel.”</p>
<p>I feel called to preach the Word of God and administer the Sacraments.</p>
<p>I feel called to equip the saints for the work of ministry, to help make “every Christian a theologian” a tangible reality in local churches.</p>
<p>Would you join with me in praying that I would be a “holy and loving servant and shepherd of the flock for whom [Christ] shed [his] most precious blood”?</p>
<p>Would you borrow the following words from the Prayer Book and pray them for me, Joshua Steele, a sinner?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Give your grace, we humbly pray, to all who are called to any office and ministry for your people; and so fill them with the truth of your doctrine and clothe them with holiness of life, that they may faithfully serve before you, to the glory of your great Name and for the benefit of your holy Church; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I’m getting ordained to the priesthood</em> <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/ordination/"><em>this Saturday, November 02</em></a><em>. For public/posterity’s sake, I wanted to post some of the main parts of the ordination liturgy (from the ACNA’s 2019 Book of Common Prayer).</em></p>
<h2 id="the-presentation">The Presentation</h2>
<p><em>The Bishop and People sit. The Presenters, standing before the Bishop, present the Ordinand, saying</em></p>
<p>Reverend Father in God, we present <em>N.N.</em> to be admitted to the Order of Priests.</p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em> Has <em>he</em> been selected in accordance with the Canons of this Church? And do you believe <em>his</em> manner of life to be suitable to the exercise of this ministry?</p>
<p><em>Presenters:</em> We certify to you that <em>he</em> has satisfied the requirements of the Canons, and we believe <em>him</em> to be qualified for this Order.</p>
<p><em>The Bishop shall then require the Ordinand to take the Oath of Conformity and the Oath of Canonical Obedience saying</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Canons require that no Deacon may be ordained a Priest in the Church before subscribing without reservation to the Oath of Conformity. It is also required that each Ordinand subscribe without reservation to the Oath of Canonical Obedience. In the presence of this Congregation, I now charge you to make your solemn declaration of these oaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Ordinand then declares</em></p>
<h3 id="the-oath-of-conformity">(The Oath of Conformity)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I, <em>N.N</em>., do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the Word of God and to contain all things necessary to salvation, and I consequently hold myself bound to conform my life and ministry thereto, and therefore I do solemnly engage to conform to the Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship of Christ as this Church has received them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-oath-of-canonical-obedience">(The Oath of Canonical Obedience)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>And I do promise, here in the presence of Almighty God and of the Church, that I will pay true and canonical obedience in all things lawful and honest to the Bishop of _______, and his successors, so help me God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Ordinand then signs the Oath of Conformity and the Oath of Canonical Obedience in the sight of all present.</em></p>
<p><em>All stand. The Bishop says to the People</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, you know the importance of this ministry, and the weight of your responsibility in presenting <em>N.N.</em> for ordination to the sacred Priesthood. Therefore if any of you know of any impediment or crime because of which we should not proceed, come forward now and make it known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>If no objection is made, the Bishop continues</em></p>
<p>Is it your will that <em>N</em>. be ordained a Priest?</p>
<p><em>People:</em> <strong>It is.</strong></p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em> Will you uphold <em>him</em> in this ministry?</p>
<p><em>People:</em> <strong>We will.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-exhortation">The Exhortation</h2>
<p><em>All are seated except the Ordinand, who stands before the Bishop.</em></p>
<p><em>The Bishop addresses the Ordinand as follows</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have heard, during the Church’s discernment of your vocation and in the Holy Scriptures themselves, how weighty is this Office to which you are called. I now exhort you, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to be a messenger, watchman, and steward of the Lord. You are to teach, to warn, to feed, and to provide for the Lord’s family, and to seek for Christ’s sheep who are in the midst of this fallen world, that they may be saved through Christ for ever.</p>
<p>Remember how great is this treasure committed to your charge. They are the sheep of Christ for whom he shed his blood. The Church and Congregation whom you will serve is his bride, his body. If the Church, or any of her members, is hurt or hindered by your negligence, you must know both the gravity of your fault, and the grievous judgment that will result.</p>
<p>Therefore, consider the purpose of your ministry to the children of God. Work diligently, with your whole heart, to bring those in your care into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of God, and to maturity in Christ, that there may be among you neither error in religion nor immorality in life. Finally, equip and lead your Congregation to proclaim tirelessly the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And seeing that the demands of this holy Office are so great, lay aside all worldly distractions and take care to direct all that you do to this purpose: read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the Scriptures, that you may show yourself both dutiful and thankful to the Lord; and frame your conduct, and that of your household and those committed to your care, according to the doctrine and discipline of Christ. Know, however, that you cannot accomplish this of yourself; for the will and the ability needed are given by God alone. Therefore, pray earnestly for his Holy Spirit to enlighten your mind and strengthen your resolve.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-examination">The Examination</h2>
<p><em>The Bishop then examines the Ordinand, saying</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So that this Congregation of Christ’s Church may know your intent in these things, I charge you to answer plainly these questions, which I, in the Name of God and his Church, now ask:</p>
<p>Do you believe in your heart that you are truly called, according to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, and according to the Canons of this Church, to the Order and ministry of the Priesthood?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I do so believe.</p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe that the Holy Scriptures contain all things necessary for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ? And are you determined out of the Holy Scriptures to instruct the people committed to your charge, and to teach or maintain nothing as necessary to eternal salvation but that which may be concluded and proved by the Scriptures?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I do so believe, and I am so determined, the Lord being my helper.</p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you then give your faithful diligence always so to minister the doctrine, sacraments, and discipline of Christ, as the Lord has commanded and as this Church has received them, according to the Commandments of God, so that you may teach the people committed to your charge with all diligence to keep and observe them?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I will, the Lord being my helper.</p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you be ready, with all faithful diligence, to banish and drive away from the Body of Christ all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God’s Word; and to use both public and private admonitions and exhortations, to the weak as well as the strong within your charge, as need shall require and occasion shall be given?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I will, the Lord being my helper.</p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you be diligent in prayer, and in the reading of Holy Scripture, and in such study as may further the knowledge of the same, laying aside all distractions of the world and the flesh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I will, the Lord being my helper.</p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you be diligent to frame and fashion your own <em>life</em> [and the <em>life</em> of your <em>family</em>], according to the doctrine of Christ, and to make <em>yourself</em> [and them, as much as you are able], a wholesome example and pattern to the flock of Christ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I will, the Lord being my helper.</p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you maintain and set forward, as much as you are able, quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people, and especially among those who are or shall be committed to your charge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I will, the Lord being my helper.</p>
<p><em>Bishop:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you reverently obey your Bishop and other chief Ministers who, according to the Canons of the Church, may have charge and authority over you, following with a glad mind and a good will their godly admonitions, and submitting yourself to their godly judgments?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I will, the Lord being my helper.</p>
<p><em>The Congregation may kneel, and prays silently for the fulfillment of these purposes.</em></p>
<p><em>The Bishop prays</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who has given you a good will to do all these things, grant you also the strength and power to perform them, accomplishing in you the good work which he has begun, that you may be found perfect and without reproach on the last day; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen**.**</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Ordinand kneels or lies prostrate, facing the Bishop, with the priests present surrounding the Ordinand.</em></p>
<p><em>The Veni, Creator Spiritus is sung or said as a prayer for the renewal of the Church.</em></p>
<h2 id="veni-creator-spiritus">Veni, Creator Spiritus</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,<br>
And lighten with celestial fire.<br>
Thou the anointing Spirit art,<br>
Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart.</p>
<p>Thy blessed unction from above<br>
Is comfort, life, and fire of love.<br>
Enable with perpetual light<br>
The dullness of our blinded sight.</p>
<p>Anoint and cheer our soiled face<br>
With the abundance of thy grace.<br>
Keep far our foes, give peace at home;<br>
Where thou art guide, no ill can come.</p>
<p>Teach us to know the Father, Son,<br>
And thee, of both, to be but One;<br>
That, through the ages all along,<br>
This may be our endless song</p>
<p>Praise to thy eternal merit,<br>
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-consecration-of-the-priest">The Consecration of the Priest</h2>
<p><em>All now stand as witnesses, except the Ordinand, who kneels facing the Bishop. The Bishop prays the following prayer, first saying</em></p>
<p>Let us pray.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almighty God and most merciful Father, of your infinite love and goodness you have given your only Son Jesus Christ to be our redeemer and the author of everlasting life. After he had made perfect our redemption by his death and resurrection, and ascended into heaven, he sent into the whole world his apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers; by the Holy Spirit, through their labor and ministry, he gathered together a great flock to set forth the eternal praise of your holy Name. For these great benefits, and because you have called <em>this</em> your <em>servant</em> to the same office and ministry, we offer you our most hearty thanks; and we humbly ask that we may daily increase in the knowledge and faith of you and of your Son, and that by <em>this minister</em>, as well as by those entrusted to <em>his</em> care, your holy Name may for ever be glorified, and your blessed kingdom enlarged; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen**.**</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Bishop with the Priests present lay their hands upon the head of each one to receive the Order of Priesthood. The Bishop says</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Receive the Holy Spirit for the office and work of a Priest in the Church of God, now committed to you by the imposition of our hands. If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven. If you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld. Be a faithful minister of God’s holy Word and Sacraments; in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Bishop then prays the following over the Ordinand.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send your heavenly blessing upon <em>this</em> your <em>servant</em>, that <em>he</em> may be clothed with righteousness, and that your Word, spoken by <em>his</em> mouth, may have such success that it may never be spoken in vain. Grant also that we may have grace to hear and receive what <em>he</em> shall deliver out of your most holy Word as the means of our salvation; that in all our words and deeds we may seek your glory and the increase of your kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, world without end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The People in a loud voice respond</em></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<p><em>The new Priest may now be vested according to the Order of Priests.</em></p>
<p><em>As the Priest is vested with a stole, the Bishop says</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take the yoke of the Lord, for his yoke is easy and his burden is light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As the Priest is vested with a chasuble, the Bishop says</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Receive this priestly garment which symbolizes charity; for God is well able to give you an increase of charity and a perfect work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Bishop then anoints the hands of the new Priest with the Oil of Chrism, saying</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grant, O Lord, to consecrate and sanctify these hands by this unction and by our blessing, that whatsoever they bless may be blessed, and whatsoever they consecrate may be consecrated and sanctified, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Bishop then gives the new Priest a Bible in one hand and a chalice in the other hand saying</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take authority to preach the Word of God and to administer the Holy Sacraments. Do not forget the trust committed to you as a Priest in the Church of God.</p>

      <title>Following Christ as a Hermeneutical Problem?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to puzzle out the meaning of the following paragraph from Bonhoeffer’s &lt;em&gt;Discipleship&lt;/em&gt; (DBWE 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally eliminating simple obedience introduces a principle of scripture foreign to the Gospel.&lt;sup&gt;[19]&lt;/sup&gt; According to it, in order to understand scripture, one first must have a key to interpreting it. But that key would not be the living Christ himself in judgment and grace, and using the key would not be according to the will of the living Holy Spirit alone. Rather, the key to scripture would be a general doctrine of grace, and we ourselves would decide its use. The problem of following Christ shows itself here to be a hermeneutical problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

</blockquote>
<p>Here, Bonhoeffer appears to be contrasting the “simple obedience” required by a “costly grace” approach with a “paradoxical obedience” required by a “cheap grace” approach. The latter approach makes “a general doctrine of grace,” and not “the living Christ himself,” the “principle of scripture” (Schriftprinzip). And this general doctrine of grace, used in this way, results in a Schriftprinzip that is “foreign to the Gospel.”</p>
<p>Here’s editorial footnote 19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>[19]</sup> Bonhoeffer felt that this subject was so important that he added an entry on “principle of scripture and discipleship” to his subject index for the 1937 edition of <em>Discipleship</em>. See also Bonhoeffer’s 1925 term paper, “Is There a Difference between Historical and Pneumatic Interpretation of Scripture, and What Is the Point of View of Dogmatics?” (<em>DBW</em> 9:305–23).</p>
<p><cite> Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/dbw04?ref=DBW.DBW+4:74&amp;off=794&amp;ctx=r+those+who+follow.%0a~Fundamentally+elimin"><em>Discipleship</em></a>, ed. Martin Kuske et al., trans. Barbara Green and Reinhard Krauss, vol. 4, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2003), 82n19.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, that 1925 term paper is *very* interesting. I don’t have time/space to summarize it here, but consider the following mention of “principle of scripture.” Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard that must be preserved in the exegesis of scripture is handed to us along with the word that is the revelation and foundation of the Bible. This standard is taken from the Bible itself and is, as Luther noted, “what drives toward Christ.” What the content of revelation does not have is not canonical.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><cite> Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/dbw09?ref=DBW.DBW+9:320&amp;off=1827&amp;ctx=stle+Paul+himself.7%0a~The+standard+that+mu"><em>The Young Bonhoeffer: 1918–1927</em></a>, ed. Hans Pfeifer et al., trans. Mary C. Nebelsick and Douglas W. Stott, vol. 9, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2003), 297.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then adds in a footnote (this is Bonhoeffer’s footnote, not the editors’):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>8</sup> Hereby we are criticizing Calvin’s Reformed principle of Scripture and its repristination by Barth, which places the concept of the canon above Luther’s individual statement. We know that Luther is taking a very bold step, but we also know that it is in the interest of Protestant faith for us to take it with him.<sup>[90]</sup></p>

Hans Pfeifer et al., trans. Mary C. Nebelsick and Douglas W. Stott, vol. 9, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2003), 297n8.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(Footnote 90 there is not Bonhoeffer’s original, but the editors. They draw our attention to: “Barth, “Das Schriftprinzip,” 221ff. esp. 223.” This is: “Das Schriftprinzip der reformierten Kirche” (The scriptural principle in the Reformed church). Zwischen den Zeiten 3/3 (1925): 215–45.)</em></p>
<p>So far, so good. I think I’m tracking with Bonhoeffer, although I’m not sure whether or not this critique of a “principle of scripture” has anything to do with the critique in his 1925 seminar paper.</p>
<p>But, I’ve only quoted the first half of the paragraph in question from <em>Discipleship</em>!</p>
<p>Bonhoeffer continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it should be clear to a Gospel-oriented hermeneutic that we cannot simply identify ourselves directly with those called by Jesus. Instead, those who are called in scripture themselves belong to the word of God and thus to the proclamation of the word. In preaching we hear not only Jesus’ answer to a disciple’s question, which could also be our own question. Rather, question and answer together must be proclaimed as the word of scripture. Simple obedience would be misunderstood hermeneutically if we were to act and follow as if we were contemporaries of the biblical disciples. But the Christ proclaimed to us in scripture is, through every word he says, the one whose gift of faith is granted only to the obedient, faith to the obedient alone. We cannot and may not go behind the word of scripture to the actual events. Instead, we are called to follow Christ by the entire word of scripture, simply because we do not intend to wish to violate scripture by legalistically applying a principle to it, even that of a doctrine of faith.<sup>[20]</sup></p>

Martin Kuske et al., trans. Barbara Green and Reinhard Krauss, vol. 4, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2003), 82.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s editorial footnote 20:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>[20]</sup> Tholuck preceded his interpretation of the so-called antitheses, Matt. 5:21–48, with “two hermeneutic canons” (i.e., rules of interpretation), “through neglect of which misunderstandings of a radical and practical nature have been occasioned. 1. In this section, as indeed everywhere, not the <em>literal</em>, but the <em>spiritual</em>, interpretation is the true one” (<em>Commentary</em>, 163). “2. Our Lord’s mode of address is that of the popular orator; … hence, we have no right to take the letter of what He says in a strict literal sense, and to press it unduly” (165). Both places are marked in Bonhoeffer’s copy. Bonhoeffer was thinking of such rules for “dealing with” the Sermon on the Mount (cf. below, page 181) when he wrote on October 24, 1936: “I hope to finish my book [<em>Discipleship</em>], and would really like to start writing a hermeneutics volume. It seems to me there is a huge deficit there” (<em>DBW</em> 14:257 [<em>GS</em> 1:47]).</p>
<p><cite> Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <a href="https://ref.ly/logosres/dbw04?ref=DBW.DBW+4:74&amp;off=794&amp;ctx=r+those+who+follow.%0a~Fundamentally+elimin"><em>Discipleship</em></a>, ed. Martin Kuske et al., trans. Barbara Green and Reinhard Krauss, vol. 4, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2003), 82n20.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taken out of context, I *think* I understand Bonhoeffer’s caution against placing ourselves too directly into the situation of Jesus’s original disciples. And this caution strikes me as significant, given Bonhoeffer’s penchant for moving rather <em>immediately</em>, let’s say, from the text to the present application of the text.</p>
<p>However, I *don’t* understand the connection between this caution and the warning against making a general doctrine of grace into a principle of scripture that’s foreign to the gospel. What does letting both the disciples’ questions and Jesus’s answers stand as the Word of God have to do with not making grace into a principle that we can then use to avoid simple obedience to Jesus’ commands?</p>

      <title>Two of Bonhoeffer&#39;s Most Convicting Paragraphs</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/two-of-bonhoeffers-most-convicting-paragraphs/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:33:03 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is from Bonhoeffer’s &lt;em&gt;Discipleship&lt;/em&gt; (usually known as “The Cost of Discipleship” in English, although the original title in German was simply &lt;em&gt;Nachfolge&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonhoeffer considers how we might respond to Jesus if Jesus were to show up and make the same kinds of concrete commands that he did in the Gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: I’ve taken two paragraphs in the original and broken them up into smaller chunks to facilitate reading here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is from Bonhoeffer’s <em>Discipleship</em> (usually known as “The Cost of Discipleship” in English, although the original title in German was simply <em>Nachfolge</em>).</p>
<p>Bonhoeffer considers how we might respond to Jesus if Jesus were to show up and make the same kinds of concrete commands that he did in the Gospels.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: I’ve taken two paragraphs in the original and broken them up into smaller chunks to facilitate reading here.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Jesus Christ were to speak this way [he told the rich young ruler to sell his possessions] to one of us today through the Holy Scripture, then we would probably argue thus:</p>
<p>Jesus is making a specific commandment; that’s true. But when Jesus commands, then I should know that he never demands legalistic obedience. Instead, he has only one expectation of me, namely, that I believe.</p>
<p>My faith, however, is not tied to poverty or wealth or some such thing. On the contrary, in faith I can be both—rich and poor. The main concern is not whether or not I have any worldly goods, but that I should possess goods as if I did not possess them, and inwardly I should be free of them. I should not set my heart on my possessions.</p>
<p>Thus, Jesus says, “Sell your possessions!” But what he intends is that it is not important if you actually do this literally, outwardly. You are free to keep your possessions, but have them as if you did not have them. Do not set your heart on your possessions.</p>
<p>Our obedience to Jesus’ word would then consist in our rejecting simple obedience as legalistic obedience, in order to be obedient “in faith.”</p>
<p>This is the difference between us and the rich young man. In his sadness, he is not able to calm himself by saying to himself, “In spite of Jesus’ word, I want to remain rich, but I will become inwardly free from my riches and comfort my inadequacy with the forgiveness of sins and be in communion with Jesus by faith.” Instead, he went away sadly and, in rejecting obedience, lost his chance to have faith. The young man was sincere in going away. He parted from Jesus, and this sincerity surely had more promise than a false communion with Jesus based on disobedience.</p>
<p>Apparently Jesus thought that the young man was unable to free himself inwardly from his wealth. Probably the young man, as a serious and ambitious person, had tried to do it himself a thousand times. The fact that at the decisive moment he was unable to obey the word of Jesus shows that he failed. The young man was sincere in parting from Jesus.</p>
<p>By the way we argue, we distance ourselves fundamentally from a biblical hearer of Jesus’ word.</p>
<p>If Jesus said: leave everything else behind and follow me, leave your profession, your family, your people, and your father’s house, then the biblical hearer knew that the only answer to this call is simple obedience, because the promise of community with Jesus is given to this obedience.</p>
<p>But we would say: Jesus’ call is to be taken “absolutely seriously,” but true obedience to it consists of my staying in my profession and in my family and serving him there, in true inner freedom.</p>
<p>Thus, Jesus would call: come out!—but we would understand that he actually meant: stay in!—of course, as one who has inwardly come out.</p>
<p>Or Jesus would say, do not worry; but we would understand: of course we should worry and work for our families and ourselves. Anything else would be irresponsible. But inwardly we should be free of such worry.</p>
<p>Jesus would say: if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also. But we would understand: it is precisely in fighting, in striking back, that genuine fraternal love grows large.</p>
<p>Jesus would say: strive first for the kingdom of God. We would understand: of course, we should first strive for all sorts of other things. How else should we survive? What he really meant was that final inner willingness to invest everything for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Everywhere it is the same—the deliberate avoidance of simple, literal obedience.</p>
<p>How is such a reversal possible? What has happened that the word of Jesus has to endure this game? That it is so vulnerable to the scorn of the world?</p>
<p>Anywhere else in the world where commands are given, the situation is clear. A father says to his child: go to bed! The child knows exactly what to do.</p>
<p>But a child drilled in pseudotheology would have to argue thus:</p>
<p>Father says go to bed. He means you are tired; he does not want me to be tired. But I can also overcome my tiredness by going to play. So, although father says go to bed, what he really means is go play.</p>
<p>With this kind of argumentation, a child with its father or a citizen with the authorities would run into an unmistakable response, namely, punishment. The situation is supposed to be different only with respect to Jesus’ command. In that case simple obedience is supposed to be wrong, or even to constitute disobedience.</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>

There is another way! But community and Sabbath both require sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas we once shared the same temporal rhythms—five days on, two days off, federal holidays, thank-God-it’s-Fridays—our weeks are now shaped by the unpredictable dictates of our employers. Nearly a fifth of Americans hold jobs with nonstandard or variable hours. They may work seasonally, on rotating shifts, or in the gig economy driving for Uber or delivering for Postmates. Meanwhile, more people on the upper end of the pay scale are working long hours. Combine the people who have unpredictable workweeks with those who have prolonged ones, and you get a good third of the American labor force.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The personalization of time may seem like a petty concern, and indeed some people consider it liberating to set their own hours or spend their “free” time reaching for the brass ring. But the consequences could be debilitating for the U.S. in the same way they once were for the U.S.S.R. A calendar is more than the organization of days and months. It’s the blueprint for a shared life.</p>

      <title>The “Via Media”? Or the “Middle Ground Fallacy”?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-via-media-or-the-middle-ground-fallacy/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 14:19:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-via-media-or-the-middle-ground-fallacy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this point, this is just a sketch. But I’m wondering how we Anglican Christians ought to be careful to keep our precious “via media” (“middle way”) mentality and methodology separate from what’s known as the “middle ground” fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-via-media&#34;&gt;The “Via Media”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Donald McKim in the &lt;em&gt;Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms&lt;/em&gt;, the “via media” is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Lat. “the middle way”) Term used to describe the identity of Anglicanism as a middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. It was coined by John Henry Newman (1801–90) during the Oxford movement (337).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At this point, this is just a sketch. But I’m wondering how we Anglican Christians ought to be careful to keep our precious “via media” (“middle way”) mentality and methodology separate from what’s known as the “middle ground” fallacy.</p>
<h2 id="the-via-media">The “Via Media”</h2>
<p>According to Donald McKim in the <em>Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms</em>, the “via media” is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Lat. “the middle way”) Term used to describe the identity of Anglicanism as a middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. It was coined by John Henry Newman (1801–90) during the Oxford movement (337).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The glossary in the back of <em>The Study of Anglicanism</em> gives a bit longer definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Via Media: ‘the middle way’, a designation for the stance of Anglicanism between Roman Catholicism and one form or another of Protestantism. The significance of the term is ambiguous, since on occasions extreme or radical Protestantism (Anabaptism) is taken as one pole, in which case Anglicanism shares the ‘middle way’ with e.g. Lutheranism; on other occasions the designation is intended to contrast Anglicanism with more central forms of Protestantism, e.g. Puritanism (qv), Presbyterianism, and what J. H. Newman called ‘popular Protestantism’ (506).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as Paul Avis notes in his  <em>In Search of Authority: Anglican Theological Method from the Reformation to the Enlightenment</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no settled ‘Anglican’ platform in this period, let alone a generally recognized concept of a via media between Rome and the Reformation: the Church of England saw itself as within the family of Protestant Churches, but also as the exemplar among them of apostolic, primitive Christianity, liturgical and episcopal (133).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the historical debates about the “via media,” it has emerged, I think, as a hallmark of the Anglican way of doing theology. Indeed, it’s one of my favorite things about being an Anglican!</p>
<p>And yet, how do we keep this “via media” separate from what’s known as the “Middle Ground” fallacy?</p>
<h2 id="the-middle-ground-fallacy">The “Middle Ground” Fallacy</h2>
<p>According to the fantastic website, <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/middle-ground">YourLogicalFallacyIs.com</a>, the “Middle Ground” fallacy is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You claimed that a compromise, or middle point, between two extremes must be the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They elaborate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the time the truth does indeed lie between two extreme points, but this can bias our thinking: sometimes a thing is simply untrue and a compromise of it is also untrue. Half way between truth and a lie, is still a lie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holly said that vaccinations caused autism in children, but her scientifically well-read friend Caleb said that this claim had been debunked and proven false. Their friend Alice offered a compromise that vaccinations must cause some autism, just not all autism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about this fallacy, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation">the Wikipedia page for the “Argument to moderation” (<em>argumentum ad temperantiam</em>)</a>, which is also known as:</p>
<ul>
<li>false equivalence,</li>
<li>false compromise,</li>
<li>(argument from) middle ground,</li>
<li>fallacy of gray,</li>
<li>equidistance fallacy, and</li>
<li>the golden mean fallacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="as-i-said-this-is-just-a-sketch-an-open-question">As I said, this is just a sketch, an open question.</h2>
<p>So, I welcome your feedback in the comments below.</p>
<p>Can we carve out a middle way between the via media and the middle ground fallacy?</p>
<p>What if there aren’t always “very fine people on both sides”?</p>
<p>What if the truth isn’t always somewhere in the murky middle ground between two opposing positions?</p>

<h2 id="the-connection-between-christology-and-soteriology">The connection between christology and soteriology</h2>
<p>A cornerstone of orthodox Christian theology is summed up in the phrase “what is not assumed is not healed”. The phrase is echoed by many early church fathers, but it is credited to St. Gregory of Nazianzus.</p>
<p>I teach this principle to undergraduates in my theology classes every semester when we are discussing the development of classical christology (the doctrine of Christ). And my students usually grasp the significance of this principle quite easily.</p>
<p>As the early church fathers sought to make sense of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ, they recognized that if Christ were not fully human—human in every way as we are, yet without sin—then Christ could not redeem humanity.</p>
<p>Thus, Jesus Christ had to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a real human body,</li>
<li>a real human mind,</li>
<li>real human emotions, and</li>
<li>a real human soul.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the words of St. Gregory of Nazianzus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For that which he has not assumed he has not healed; but that which is united to his Godhead is also saved. If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole nature of him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole” (Epistle 101, 32).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, christology and soteriology (the doctrine of salvation) are intimately connected. To rescue us from the dominion of Sin, Evil, and Death, the Word, the Second Person of the Trinity, had to become like us.</p>
<p>As the divine Word, he could descend into the darkest depths of human sin and suffering without being overcome by them. And, as the Word-made-flesh, he could ascend to the heights of heaven following his resurrection—and bring us, now reconciled and united with God, along with him.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>If “what is not assumed is not healed” is a crucial, non-negotiable aspect of orthodox Christianity, then we do well to consider carefully its implications.</p>
<p>For example, if the flesh that the Word assumed in Jesus Christ was ethnically Jewish, does that mean Jesus cannot save Gentiles?</p>
<p>The church has consistently answered: No, of course not. In the logic of “what is not assumed is not healed,” what matters in the incarnation is Jesus’ <em>humanness</em>, not his Jewishness.</p>
<p>(To be clear, Jesus’ Jewishness is crucial to his person and work. Without recognizing that Jesus was a first-century Jew, and all the religious, social, and cultural implications that entails, one cannot fully understand Jesus and what he has done on our behalf. But what I’m exploring here is the logic at work in orthodox reasoning about christology and soteriology.)</p>
<p>Indeed, it is precisely in the particularities of Jesus Christ’s person that he can save all people. The particularity of the incarnation is the pathway to the universality of salvation. “[H]e had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people” and “not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world” (Heb. 2:17; 1 Jn. 2:2).</p>
<p>As Beth Felker Jones says in her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practicing-Christian-Doctrine-Introduction-Theologically/dp/0801049334/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Practicing+Christian+Doctrine&amp;pd_rd_i=0801049334&amp;pd_rd_r=01c428a0-07cc-4048-8894-9d6ce2c96457&amp;pd_rd_w=P9xKu&amp;pd_rd_wg=KXfEi&amp;pf_rd_p=39e7c2a0-69e1-4a3f-8d8f-4c4ee1aefdb5&amp;pf_rd_r=66AKMKQNSQTGPJWF63JS&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1569494218&amp;s=gateway&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=anglicanpasto-20&amp;linkId=6d704c46c306131181f6420e60ccefbf&amp;language=en_US"><em>Practicing Christian Doctrine</em></a>, “Jesus does not come among us as a generic human being; he comes as we do, with particulars.” The truth is, there is no such thing as a generic human being. So, in order to be human, the Word had to become a particular human being, with ethnicity, culture, language, sex, gender, and more.</p>
<p>What, then, of Jesus’ maleness? Can a male Christ save women?</p>
<p>Yes, orthodox theologians reply. Yes, of course he can.</p>
<p>Why? Because in assuming the flesh and blood, soul and spirit, of a particular human being, the Word has assumed the flesh and blood, soul and spirit of <em>all</em> human beings—including women.</p>
<p>(It is worth observing that, according to orthodox Christian teaching, the human nature of Jesus Christ was formed in the womb of the Virgin Mary, without the contribution of male “flesh” whatsoever. The Word-made-flesh receives his human flesh from a woman. I am grateful to my colleague, Rev. Dr. Amy Peeler, for bringing this to my attention.)</p>
<p>Again, what matters for salvation is Jesus’ <em>humanness</em>, not Jesus’ maleness.</p>
<h2 id="now-what-does-all-this-have-to-do-with-womens-ordination">Now, what does all this have to do with women’s ordination?</h2>
<p>Quite a lot, actually.</p>
<p>Many arguments are proffered against women’s ordination, some biblical, some theological, some historical, some even biological and psychological. Of course, there is far more to the arguments for and against women’s ordination than this short piece is able to address.</p>
<p>For now, due to space constraints, I choose to focus on one argument against women’s ordination that I find particularly theologically problematic: The assertion that women cannot represent Christ in the celebration of the Eucharist; the claim that women cannot act <em>in persona Christi</em> (“in the person of Christ”).</p>
<p>The argument, in short, goes something like this: Because women have female bodies and Jesus Christ has a male body, women cannot serve as a sacramental sign of Christ in the Eucharist.</p>
<p>To be more specific, women cannot act <em>in persona Christi</em> because their female bodies do not correspond to the body of the male Christ. In this view, female priests are not just <em>not allowed</em>; female priests are <em>false signifiers</em>. In their female persons, female priests lie, as it were, about the male person of Jesus Christ, who is presiding sacramentally at the altar.</p>
<p>And, as a result, women must not represent Christ at the Eucharistic feast.</p>
<p>Today, very often, though not always, this perspective is linked to a form gender essentialism gleaned from Pope John Paul II’s “<a href="http://amzn.to/2lXRIO3">theology of the body</a>” and his recent popularizer, <a href="http://amzn.to/2mV9kdy">Christopher West</a>.</p>
<p>In the theology of the body, male and female are seen as ontologically distinct, two parts of the one whole of the <em>imago Dei.</em> This “natural” gender division then serves as the foundation for structured gender roles.</p>
<p>When it comes to the function of the priesthood, then, the male sacramentally represents Christ while the female sacramentally represents the Church. Within this perspective, to have a woman priest is to usurp and upend a fundamental ontological reality of the world God has made.</p>
<p>But this brings us back to our christological and soteriological principle: “what is not assumed is not healed”. If women qua women are fundamentally incapable—and, according to some Christians, even <em>ontologically</em> incapable—of representing the male Jesus Christ in their female persons, then that calls into question whether their female persons can be redeemed by the male Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>But, of course, we know that isn’t the case.</p>
<p>All human beings—Jew and Greek, male and female, slave and free—are saved through the Incarnation of the Word (the life, death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ).</p>
<p>The particularities of Jesus’ person—a poor, Jewish, male, unmarried, 30-something adult living in first-century, Roman-occupied Israel—are the means by which <em>all</em> human persons are redeemed. And, by becoming one with Christ in our baptism, all become partakers of his Royal Priesthood.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, then all persons are potentially capable of serving as sacramental signs of their Savior.</p>
<h2 id="responding-to-an-objection-arent-redemption-and-sacramental-representation-different">Responding to an objection: Aren’t redemption and sacramental representation different?</h2>
<p>But, some might object: “Jesus, though male, can redeem women. But women can’t sacramentally represent Jesus because redemption and sacramental representation are two different things.”</p>
<p>I would respond: On what basis does the concept of sacramental representation rest?</p>
<p>Many things could be addressed on this front, but I’ll specify only a few.</p>
<h3 id="first-the-idea-of-sacramentality-is-rooted-in-part-in-the-analogy-of-being">First, the idea of sacramentality is rooted, in part, in the analogy of being.</h3>
<p>An analogy does not require a pure one-to-one correspondence—indeed, in Christian theology it specifies the opposite. Between creature and Creator there are similarities, but never such that the dissimilarities are not always greater. Thus, all analogies between God and human beings are inadequate. They are able to speak some real truth, but always fall short in the end.</p>
<p>Similarly, the sacramental representation of the priest will always fall short of pure representation because it is based on analogy.</p>
<h3 id="second-sacramental-representation-means-the-priest-functions-not-as-christ-but-as-an-icon-of-christ">Second, sacramental representation means the priest functions not <em>as Christ</em>, but as an <em>icon</em> of Christ.</h3>
<p>As William Witt has argued, priests are jars of clay, pointing away from him- or herself and pointing to Christ the High Priest, particularly as they share in his suffering (2 Cor. 4:5-10).</p>
<p>What is central is not physical similarity to the male body of Christ, but the priest’s participation in the pattern of Christ, the Suffering Servant. Insofar as the priest demonstrates this participation, the priest serves as a sacramental representation.</p>
<h3 id="finally-if-the-sacramental-validity-of-the-priesthood-is-based-in-significant-part-upon-the-sexed-and-gendered-body-of-the-priest-that-is-a-male-body-to-match-the-male-christ-then-we-find-ourselves-in-a-bit-of-a-bind">Finally, if the sacramental validity of the priesthood is based in significant part upon the sexed and gendered body of the priest (that is, a male body to match the male Christ), then we find ourselves in a bit of a bind.</h3>
<p>As Sarah Coakley (among others) has shown, in the course of the Eucharistic service, the priest not only acts <em>in persona Christi</em>, but also <em>in persona Ecclesiae</em>, which, in the imagery of Eph. 5:22, is gendered female.</p>
<p>If a woman cannot act <em>in persona Christi</em> because her female body does not match the male body of Christ, then how will a man act <em>in persona Ecclesiae</em> when his male body does not match the female Church?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that they can; because the priestly body functions sacramentally, or analogically.</p>
<h3 id="no-matter-which-priestly-body-is-the-subject-of-scrutiny-all-bodies-inevitably-fall-short-of-a-pure-one-to-one-correspondence-between-the-sexed-and-gendered-body-of-human-beings-and-the-bride-and-bridegroom-they-are-meant-to-represent">No matter which priestly body is the subject of scrutiny, all bodies inevitably fall short of a pure one-to-one correspondence between the sexed and gendered body of human beings and the Bride and Bridegroom they are meant to represent.</h3>
<p>And that brings us back to the principle of analogy. No human body exactly, literally, univocally corresponds to our Great High Priest, Jesus Christ. But, they do not have to. They need only serve as analogues, which is, in fact, core to what sacrament means in the first place.</p>
<p>Let us return then to Gregory’s great insight, “what is not assumed is not healed,” and put my overall point as plainly as possible:</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-if-christ-in-his-male-body-saves-women-through-their-shared-humanity-then-women-through-their-shared-humanity-with-christ-can-represent-christ-at-the-altar">Conclusion: If Christ in his male body saves women through their shared humanity, then women, through their shared humanity with Christ, can represent Christ at the altar.</h2>
<p>If they cannot—if, in their female bodies, women are incapable of serving as sacramental signs of the male Savior, Jesus Christ—then women’s salvation is in jeopardy, as is the salvation of all who differ from Christ in their embodied particulars.</p>
<p>The good news of “what is not assumed is not healed” is that this jeopardy is decidedly <em>not</em> the case. The Word-made-flesh has made provision in his life, death, resurrection, and ascension for the salvation of all humankind. As Gregory of Nazianzus insisted: “[God] has assumed humanity for our salvation … that by one and the same person, who was perfect man and also God, the entire humanity fallen through sin might be created anew” (Epistle 101, 34).</p>
<p>Do women demonstrate bodily differences from the God-man, Jesus Christ? Yes, of course they do.</p>
<p>But it is by virtue of those very distinctions that women offer a powerful sacramental sign of our Great High Priest and the new creation he has inaugurated in his body. And we who feast at Eucharistic tables presided over by women priests get to see glimpses of this new creation every Sunday.</p>

<h2 id="volume-i-introduction">VOLUME I: INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3 id="1-the-task-of-dogmatics">§1 THE TASK OF DOGMATICS</h3>
<p>As a theological discipline dogmatics is the scientific self-examination of the Christian Church with respect to the content of its distinctive talk about God.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-task-of-prolegomena-to-dogmatics">§2 THE TASK OF PROLEGOMENA TO DOGMATICS</h3>
<p>Prolegomena to dogmatics is our name for the introductory part of dogmatics in which our concern is to understand its particular way of knowledge.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-doctrine-of-the-word-of-god">THE DOCTRINE OF THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-i-the-word-of-god-as-the-criterion-of-dogmatics">Chapter I: The Word of God as the Criterion of Dogmatics</h2>
<h3 id="3-church-proclamation-as-the-material-of-dogmatics">§3 CHURCH PROCLAMATION AS THE MATERIAL OF DOGMATICS</h3>
<p>Talk about God in the Church seeks to be proclamation to the extent that in the form of preaching and sacrament it is directed to man with the claim and expectation that in accordance with commission it has to speak to him the Word of God to be heard in faith. Inasmuch as it is a human word in spite of this claim and expectation, it is the material of dogmatics, i.e., of the investigation of its responsibility as measured by the Word of God which it seeks to proclaim.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-word-of-god-in-its-threefold-form">§4 THE WORD OF GOD IN ITS THREEFOLD FORM</h3>
<p>The presupposition which makes proclamation proclamation and therewith makes the Church the Church is the Word of God. This attests itself in Holy Scripture in the word of the prophets and apostles to whom it was originally and once and for all spoken by God’s revelation.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-nature-of-the-word-of-god">§5 THE NATURE OF THE WORD OF GOD</h3>
<p>The Word of God in all its three forms is God’s speech to man. For this reason it occurs, applies and works in God’s act on man. But as such it occurs in God’s way which differs from all other occurrence, i.e., in the mystery of God.</p>
<h3 id="6-the-knowability-of-the-word-of-god">§6 THE KNOWABILITY OF THE WORD OF GOD</h3>
<p>The reality of the Word of God in all its three forms is grounded only in itself. So, too, the knowledge of it by men can consist only in its acknowledgment, and this acknowledgment can become real only through itself and become intelligible only in terms of itself.</p>
<h3 id="7-the-word-of-god-dogma-and-dogmatics">§7 THE WORD OF GOD, DOGMA AND DOGMATICS</h3>
<p>Dogmatics is the critical question about dogma, i.e., about the Word of God in Church proclamation, or, concretely, about the agreement of the Church proclamation done and to be done by man with the revelation attested in Holy Scripture. Prolegomena to dogmatics as an understanding of its epistemological path must therefore consist in an exposition of the three forms of the Word of God as revealed, written, and preached.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-ii-the-revelation-of-god">Chapter II: The Revelation of God</h2>
<h2 id="part-i-the-triune-god">PART I: THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<h3 id="8-god-in-his-revelation">§8 GOD IN HIS REVELATION</h3>
<p>God’s Word is God Himself in His revelation. For God reveals Himself as the Lord and according to Scripture this signifies for the concept of revelation that God Himself in unimpaired unity yet also in unimpaired distinction is Revealer, Revelation, and Revealedness.</p>
<h3 id="9-the-triunity-of-god">§9 THE TRIUNITY OF GOD</h3>
<p>The God who reveals Himself according to Scripture is One in three distinctive modes of being subsisting in their mutual relations: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It is thus that He is the Lord, i.e., the Thou who meets man’s I and unites Himself to this I as the indissoluble Subject and thereby and therein reveals Himself to him as his God.</p>
<h3 id="10-god-the-father">§10 GOD THE FATHER</h3>
<p>The one God reveals Himself according to Scripture as the Creator, that is, as the Lord of our existence. As such He is God our Father because He is so antecedently in Himself as the Father of the Son.</p>
<h3 id="11-god-the-son">§11 GOD THE SON</h3>
<p>The one God reveals Himself according to Scripture as the Reconciler, i.e., as the Lord in the midst of our enmity towards Him. As such He is the Son of God who has come to us or the Word of God that has been spoken to us, because He is so antecedently in Himself as the Son or Word of God the Father.</p>
<h3 id="12-god-the-holy-spirit">§12 GOD THE HOLY SPIRIT</h3>
<p>The one God reveals Himself according to Scripture as the Redeemer, i.e., as the Lord who sets us free. As such He is the Holy Spirit, by receiving whom we become the children of God, because, as the Spirit of the love of God the Father and the Son, He is so antecedently in Himself.</p>
<h2 id="part-ii-the-incarnation-of-the-word">PART II: THE INCARNATION OF THE WORD</h2>
<h3 id="13-gods-freedom-for-man">§13 GOD’S FREEDOM FOR MAN</h3>
<p>According to Holy Scripture God’s revelation takes place in the fact that God’s Word became a man and that this man has become God’s Word. The incarnation of the eternal Word, Jesus Christ, is God’s revelation. In the reality of this event God proves that He is free to be our God.</p>
<h3 id="14-the-time-of-revelation">§14 THE TIME OF REVELATION</h3>
<p>God’s revelation in the event of the presence of Jesus Christ is God’s time for us. It is fulfilled time in this event itself. But as the Old Testament time of expectation and as the New Testament time of recollection it is also the time of witness to this event.</p>
<h3 id="15-the-mystery-of-revelation">§15 THE MYSTERY OF REVELATION</h3>
<p>The mystery of the revelation of God in Jesus Christ consists in the fact that the eternal Word of God chose, sanctified and assumed human nature and existence into oneness with Himself, in order thus, as very God and very man, to become the Word of reconciliation spoken by God to man. The sign of this mystery revealed in the resurrection of Jesus Christ is the miracle of His birth, that He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.</p>
<h2 id="part-iii-the-outpouring-of-the-holy-spirit">PART III: THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<h3 id="16-the-freedom-of-man-for-god">§16 THE FREEDOM OF MAN FOR GOD</h3>
<p>According to Holy Scripture God’s revelation occurs in our enlightenment by the Holy Spirit of God to a knowledge of His Word. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit is God’s revelation. In the reality of this event consists our freedom to be the children of God and to know and love and praise Him in His revelation.</p>
<h3 id="17-the-revelation-of-god-as-the-abolition-of-religion">§17 THE REVELATION OF GOD AS THE ABOLITION OF RELIGION</h3>
<p>The revelation of God in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is the judging but also reconciling presence of God in the world of human religion, that is, in the realm of man’s attempts to justify and to sanctify himself before a capricious and arbitrary picture of God. The Church is the locus of true religion, so far as through grace it lives by grace.</p>
<h3 id="18-the-life-of-the-children-of-god">§18 THE LIFE OF THE CHILDREN OF GOD</h3>
<p>Where it is believed and acknowledged in the Holy Spirit, the revelation of God creates men who do not exist without seeking God in Jesus Christ, and who cannot cease to testify that He has found them.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-iii-holy-scripture">Chapter III: Holy Scripture</h2>
<h3 id="19-the-word-of-god-for-the-church">§19 THE WORD OF GOD FOR THE CHURCH</h3>
<p>The Word of God is God Himself in Holy Scripture. For God once spoke as Lord to Moses and the prophets, to the Evangelists and apostles. And now through their written word He speaks as the same Lord to His Church. Scripture is holy and the Word of God, because by the Holy Spirit it became and will become to the Church a witness to divine revelation.</p>
<h3 id="20-authority-in-the-church">§20 AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</h3>
<p>The Church does not claim direct and absolute and material authority for itself but for Holy Scripture as the Word of God. But actual obedience to the authoritative Word of God in Holy Scripture is objectively determined by the fact that those who in the Church mutually confess an acceptance of the witness of Holy Scripture will be ready and willing to listen to one another in expounding and applying it. By the authority of Holy Scripture on which it is founded, authority in the Church is restricted to an indirect and relative and formal authority.</p>
<h3 id="21-freedom-in-the-church">§21 FREEDOM IN THE CHURCH</h3>
<p>A member of the Church claims direct, absolute and material freedom not for himself, but only for Holy Scripture as the Word of God. But obedience to the free Word of God in Holy Scripture is subjectively conditioned by the fact that each individual who confesses his acceptance of the testimony of Scripture must be willing and prepared to undertake the responsibility for its interpretation and application. Freedom in the Church is limited as an indirect, relative and formal freedom by the freedom of Holy Scripture in which it is grounded.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-iv-the-proclamation-of-the-church">Chapter IV: The Proclamation of the Church</h2>
<h3 id="22-the-mission-of-the-church">§22 THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH</h3>
<p>The Word of God is God Himself in the proclamation of the Church of Jesus Christ. In so far as God gives the Church the commission to speak about Him, and the Church discharges this commission, it is God Himself who declares His revelation in His witnesses. The proclamation of the Church is pure doctrine when the human word spoken in it in confirmation of the biblical witness to revelation offers and creates obedience to the Word of God. Because this is its essential character, function and duty, the word of the Church preacher is the special and immediate object of dogmatic activity.</p>
<h3 id="23-dogmatics-as-a-function-of-the-hearing-church">§23 DOGMATICS AS A FUNCTION OF THE HEARING CHURCH</h3>
<p>Dogmatics invites the teaching Church to listen again to the Word of God in the revelation to which Scripture testifies. It can do this only if for its part it adopts the attitude of the hearing Church and therefore itself listens to the Word of God as the norm to which the hearing Church knows itself to be subject.</p>
<h3 id="24-dogmatics-as-a-function-of-the-teaching-church">§24 DOGMATICS AS A FUNCTION OF THE TEACHING CHURCH</h3>
<p>Dogmatics summons the listening Church to address itself anew to the task of teaching the Word of God in the revelation attested in Scripture. It can do this only as it accepts itself the position of the teaching Church and is therefore claimed by the Word of God as the object to which the teaching Church as such has devoted itself.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="volume-ii-the-doctrine-of-god">VOLUME II: THE DOCTRINE OF GOD</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-v-the-knowledge-of-god">Chapter V: The Knowledge of God</h2>
<h3 id="25-the-fulfilment-of-the-knowledge-of-god">§25 THE FULFILMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD</h3>
<p>The knowledge of God occurs in the fulfilment of the revelation of His Word by the Holy Spirit, and therefore in the reality and with the necessity of faith and its obedience. Its content is the existence of Him whom we must fear above all things because we may love Him above all things; who remains a mystery to us because He Himself has made Himself so clear and certain to us.</p>
<h3 id="26-the-knowability-of-god">§26 THE KNOWABILITY OF GOD</h3>
<p>The possibility of the knowledge of God springs from God, in that He is Himself the truth and He gives Himself to man in His Word by the Holy Spirit to be known as the truth. It springs from man, in that, in the Son of God by the Holy Spirit, he becomes an object of the divine good-pleasure and therefore participates in the truth of God.</p>
<h3 id="27-the-limits-of-the-knowledge-of-god">§27 THE LIMITS OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD</h3>
<p>God is known only by God. We do not know Him, then, in virtue of the views and concepts with which in faith we attempt to respond to His revelation. But we also do not know Him without making use of His permission and obeying His command to undertake this attempt. The success of this undertaking, and therefore the veracity of our knowledge of God, consists in the fact that our viewing and conceiving is adopted and determined to participation in the truth of God by God Himself in grace.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-vi-the-reality-of-god">Chapter VI: The Reality of God</h2>
<h3 id="28-the-being-of-god-as-the-one-who-loves-in-freedom">§28 THE BEING OF GOD AS THE ONE WHO LOVES IN FREEDOM</h3>
<p>God is who He is in the act of His revelation. God seeks and creates fellowship between Himself and us, and therefore He loves us. But He is this loving God without us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in the freedom of the Lord, who has His life in Himself.</p>
<h3 id="29-the-perfections-of-god">§29 THE PERFECTIONS OF GOD</h3>
<p>God lives His perfect life in the abundance of many individual and distinct perfections. Each of these is perfect in itself and in combination with all the others. For whether it is a form of love in which God is free, or a form of freedom in which God loves, it is nothing else but God Himself, His one, simple, distinctive being.</p>
<h3 id="30-the-perfections-of-the-divine-loving">§30 THE PERFECTIONS OF THE DIVINE LOVING</h3>
<p>The divinity of the love of God consists and confirms itself in the fact that in Himself and in all His works God is gracious, merciful and patient, and at the same time holy, righteous and wise.</p>
<h3 id="31-the-perfections-of-the-divine-freedom">§31 THE PERFECTIONS OF THE DIVINE FREEDOM</h3>
<p>The divinity of the freedom of God consists and confirms itself in the fact that in Himself and in all His works God is One, constant and eternal, and therewith also omnipresent, omnipotent and glorious.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-vii-the-election-of-god">Chapter VII: The Election of God</h2>
<h3 id="32-the-problem-of-a-correct-doctrine-of-the-election-of-grace">§32 THE PROBLEM OF A CORRECT DOCTRINE OF THE ELECTION OF GRACE</h3>
<p>The doctrine of election is the sum of the Gospel because of all the words that can be said and heard it is the best: that God elects man; that God is for man too the One who loves in freedom. It is grounded in the knowledge of Jesus Christ because He is both the electing God and elected man in One. It is part of the doctrine of God because originally God’s election of man is a predestination not merely of man but of Himself. Its function is to bear basic testimony to eternal, free and unchanging grace as the beginning of all the ways and works of God.</p>
<h3 id="33-the-election-of-jesus-christ">§33 THE ELECTION OF JESUS CHRIST</h3>
<p>The election of grace is the eternal beginning of all the ways and works of God in Jesus Christ. In Jesus Christ God in His free grace determines Himself for sinful man and sinful man for Himself. He therefore takes upon Himself the rejection of man with all its consequences, and elects man to participation in His own glory.</p>
<h3 id="34-the-election-of-the-community">§34 THE ELECTION OF THE COMMUNITY</h3>
<p>The election of grace, as the election of Jesus Christ, is simultaneously the eternal election of the one community of God by the existence of which Jesus Christ is to be attested to the whole world and the whole world summoned to faith in Jesus Christ. This one community of God in its form as Israel has to serve the representation of the divine judgment, in its form as the Church the representation of the divine mercy. In its form as Israel it is determined for hearing, and in its form as the Church for believing the promise sent forth to man. To the one elected community of God is given in the one case its passing, and in the other case its coming form.</p>
<h3 id="35-the-election-of-the-individual">§35 THE ELECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL</h3>
<p>The man who is isolated over against God is as such rejected by God. But to be this man can only be by the godless man’s own choice. The witness of the community of God to every individual man consists in this: that this choice of the godless man is void; that he belongs eternally to Jesus Christ and therefore is not rejected, but elected by God in Jesus Christ; that the rejection which he deserves on account of his perverse choice is borne and cancelled by Jesus Christ; and that he is appointed to eternal life with God on the basis of the righteous, divine decision. The promise of his election determines that as a member of the community he himself shall be a bearer of its witness to the whole world. And the revelation of his rejection can only determine him to believe in Jesus Christ as the One by whom it has been borne and cancelled.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-viii-the-command-of-god">Chapter VIII: The Command of God</h2>
<h3 id="36-ethics-as-a-task-of-the-doctrine-of-god">§36 ETHICS AS A TASK OF THE DOCTRINE OF GOD</h3>
<p>As the doctrine of God’s command, ethics interprets the Law as the form of the Gospel, i.e., as the sanctification which comes to man through the electing God. Because Jesus Christ is the Holy God and sanctified man in One, it has its basis in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Because the God who claims man for Himself makes Himself originally responsible for him, it forms part of the doctrine of God. Its function is to bear primary witness to the grace of God in so far as this is the saving engagement and commitment of man.</p>
<h3 id="37-the-command-as-the-claim-of-god">§37 THE COMMAND AS THE CLAIM OF GOD</h3>
<p>As God is gracious to us in Jesus Christ, His command is the claim which, when it is made, has power over us, demanding that in all we do we admit that what God does is right, and requiring that we give our free obedience to this demand.</p>
<h3 id="38-the-command-as-the-decision-of-god">§38 THE COMMAND AS THE DECISION OF GOD</h3>
<p>As God is gracious to us in Jesus Christ, His command is the sovereign, definite and good decision concerning the character of our actions—the decision from which we derive, under which we stand and to which we continually move.</p>
<h3 id="39-the-command-as-the-judgment-of-god">§39 THE COMMAND AS THE JUDGMENT OF GOD</h3>
<p>As God is gracious to us in Jesus Christ, He judges us. He judges us because it is His will to treat us as His own for the sake of His own Son. He judges us as in His Son’s death He condemns all our actions as transgression, and by His Son’s resurrection pronounces us righteous. He judges us in order that He may make us free for everlasting life under His lordship.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="volume-iii-the-doctrine-of-creation">VOLUME III: THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-ix-the-work-of-creation">Chapter IX: The Work of Creation</h2>
<h3 id="40-faith-in-god-the-creator">§40 FAITH IN GOD THE CREATOR</h3>
<p>The insight that man owes his existence and form, together with all the reality distinct from God, to God’s creation, is achieved only in the reception and answer of the divine self-witness, that is, only in faith in Jesus Christ, i.e., in the knowledge of the unity of Creator and creature actualised in Him, and in the life in the present mediated by Him, under the right and in the experience of the goodness of the Creator towards His creature.</p>
<h3 id="41-creation-and-covenant">§41 CREATION AND COVENANT</h3>
<p>Creation comes first in the series of works of the triune God, and is thus the beginning of all the things distinct from God Himself. Since it contains in itself the beginning of time, its historical reality eludes all historical observation and account, and can be expressed in the biblical creation narratives only in the form of pure saga. But according to this witness the purpose and therefore the meaning of creation is to make possible the history of God’s covenant with man which has its beginning, its centre and its culmination in Jesus Christ. The history of this covenant is as much the goal of creation as creation itself is the beginning of this history.</p>
<h3 id="42-the-yes-of-god-the-creator">§42 THE YES OF GOD THE CREATOR</h3>
<p>The work of God the Creator consists particularly in the benefit that in the limits of its creatureliness what He has created may be as it is actualised by Him, and be good as it is justified by Him.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-x-the-creature">Chapter X: The Creature</h2>
<h3 id="43-man-as-a-problem-of-dogmatics">§43 MAN AS A PROBLEM OF DOGMATICS</h3>
<p>Because man, living under heaven and on earth, is the creature whose relation to God is revealed to us in the Word of God, he is the central object of the theological doctrine of creation. As the man Jesus is Himself the revealing Word of God, He is the source of our knowledge of the nature of man as created by God.</p>
<h3 id="44-man-as-the-creature-of-god">§44 MAN AS THE CREATURE OF GOD</h3>
<p>The being of man is the history which shows how one of God’s creatures, elected and called by God, is caught up in personal responsibility before Him and proves itself capable of fulfilling it.</p>
<h3 id="45-man-in-his-determination-as-the-covenant-partner-of-god">§45 MAN IN HIS DETERMINATION AS THE COVENANT-PARTNER OF GOD</h3>
<p>That real man is determined by God for life with God has its inviolable correspondence in the fact that his creaturely being is a being in encounter—between I and Thou, man and woman. It is human in this encounter, and in this humanity it is a likeness of the being of its Creator and a being in hope in Him.</p>
<h3 id="46-man-as-soul-and-body">§46 MAN AS SOUL AND BODY</h3>
<p>Through the Spirit of God, man is the subject, form and life of a substantial organism, the soul of his body—wholly and simultaneously both, in ineffaceable difference, inseparable unity, and indestructible order.</p>
<h3 id="47-man-in-his-time">§47 MAN IN HIS TIME</h3>
<p>Man lives in the allotted span of his present, past and future life. He who was before him and will be after him, and who therefore fixes the boundaries of his being, is the eternal God, his Creator and Covenant-partner. He is the hope in which man may live in his time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-xi-the-creator-and-his-creature">Chapter XI: The Creator and His Creature</h2>
<h3 id="48-the-doctrine-of-providence-its-basis-and-form">§48 THE DOCTRINE OF PROVIDENCE, ITS BASIS AND FORM</h3>
<p>The doctrine of providence deals with the history of created being as such, in the sense that in every respect and in its whole span this proceeds under the fatherly care of God the Creator, whose will is done and is to be seen in His election of grace, and therefore in the history of the covenant between Himself and man, and therefore in Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3 id="49-god-the-father-as-lord-of-his-creature">§49 GOD THE FATHER AS LORD OF HIS CREATURE</h3>
<p>God fulfils His fatherly lordship over His creature by preserving, accompanying and ruling the whole course of its earthly existence. He does this as His mercy is revealed and active in the creaturely sphere in Jesus Christ, and the lordship of His Son is thus manifested in it.</p>
<h3 id="50-god-and-nothingness">§50 GOD AND NOTHINGNESS</h3>
<p>Under the control of God world-occurrence is threatened and actually corrupted by the nothingness which is inimical to the will of the Creator and therefore to the nature of His good creature. God has judged nothingness by His mercy as revealed and effective in Jesus Christ. Pending the final revelation that it is already refuted and abolished, God determines the sphere, the manner, the measure and the subordinate relationship to His Word and work in which it may still operate.</p>
<h3 id="51-the-kingdom-of-heaven-the-ambassadors-of-god-and-their-opponents">§51 THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, THE AMBASSADORS OF GOD AND THEIR OPPONENTS</h3>
<p>God’s action in Jesus Christ, and therefore His lordship over His creature, is called the “kingdom of heaven” because first and supremely it claims for itself the upper world. From this God selects and sends His messengers, the angels, who precede the revelation and doing of His will on earth as objective and authentic witnesses, who accompany it as faithful servants of God and man, and who victoriously ward off the opposing forms and forces of chaos.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-xii-the-command-of-god-the-creator">Chapter XII: The Command of God the Creator</h2>
<h3 id="52-ethics-as-a-task-of-the-doctrine-of-creation">§52 ETHICS AS A TASK OF THE DOCTRINE OF CREATION</h3>
<p>The task of special ethics in the context of the doctrine of creation is to show to what extent the one command of the one God who is gracious to man in Jesus Christ is also the command of his Creator and therefore already the sanctification of the creaturely action and abstention of man.</p>
<h3 id="53-freedom-before-god">§53 FREEDOM BEFORE GOD</h3>
<p>It is the will of God the Creator that man, as His creature, shall be responsible before Him. In particular, His command says that man is to keep His day holy as a day of worship, freedom and joy, that he is to confess Him in his heart and with his mouth and that he is to come to Him with his requests.</p>
<h3 id="54-freedom-in-fellowship">§54 FREEDOM IN FELLOWSHIP</h3>
<p>As God the Creator calls man to Himself, He also directs him to his fellowman. The divine command affirms in particular that in the encounter of man and woman, in the relationship between parents and children and outwards from near to distant neighbours, man may affirm, honour and enjoy the other with himself and himself with the other.</p>
<h3 id="55-freedom-for-life">§55 FREEDOM FOR LIFE</h3>
<p>As God the Creator calls man to Himself and turns him to his fellow-man, He orders him to honour his own life and that of every other man as a loan, and to secure it against all caprice, in order that it may be used in this service and in preparation for this service.</p>
<h3 id="56-freedom-in-limitation">§56 FREEDOM IN LIMITATION</h3>
<p>God the Creator wills and claims the man who belongs to Him, is united to his fellow-man and under obligation to affirm his own life and that of others, with the special intention indicated by the limit of time, vocation and honour which He has already set him as his Creator and Lord.</p>

<h2 id="volume-iv-the-doctrine-of-reconciliation">VOLUME IV: THE DOCTRINE OF RECONCILIATION</h2>
<h2 id="chapter-xiii-the-subject-matter-and-problems-of-the-doctrine-of-reconciliation">Chapter XIII: The Subject-Matter and Problems of the Doctrine of Reconciliation</h2>
<h3 id="57-the-work-of-god-the-reconciler">§57 THE WORK OF GOD THE RECONCILER</h3>
<p>The subject-matter, origin and content of the message received and proclaimed by the Christian community is at its heart the free act of the faithfulness of God in which He takes the lost cause of man, who has denied Him as Creator and in so doing ruined himself as creature, and makes it His own in Jesus Christ, carrying it through to its goal and in that way maintaining and manifesting His own glory in the world.</p>
<h3 id="58-the-doctrine-of-reconciliation-survey">§58 THE DOCTRINE OF RECONCILIATION (SURVEY)</h3>
<p>The content of the doctrine of reconciliation is the knowledge of Jesus Christ who is<br>
(1) very God, that is, the God who humbles Himself, and therefore the reconciling God,<br>
(2) very man, that is, man exalted and therefore reconciled by God, and<br>
(3) in the unity of the two the guarantor and witness of our atonement.</p>
<p>This threefold knowledge of Jesus Christ includes the knowledge of the sin of man:<br>
(1) his pride,<br>
(2) his sloth and<br>
(3) his falsehood—the knowledge of the event in which reconciliation is made:<br>
(1) his justification,<br>
(2) his sanctification and<br>
(3) his calling—and the knowledge of the work of the Holy Spirit in<br>
(1) the gathering,<br>
(2) the upbuilding and<br>
(3) the sending of the community, and of the being of Christians<br>
(1) in faith,<br>
(2) in love and<br>
(3) in hope.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-xiv-jesus-christ-the-lord-as-servant">Chapter XIV: Jesus Christ, the Lord as Servant</h2>
<h3 id="59-the-obedience-of-the-son-of-god">§59 THE OBEDIENCE OF THE SON OF GOD</h3>
<p>That Jesus Christ is very God is shown in His way into the far country in which He the Lord became a servant. For in the majesty of the true God it happened that the eternal Son of the eternal Father became obedient by offering and humbling Himself to be the brother of man, to take His place with the transgressor, to judge him by judging Himself and dying in his place. But God the Father raised Him from the dead, and in so doing recognised and gave effect to His death and passion as a satisfaction made for us, as our conversion to God, and therefore as our redemption from death to life.</p>
<h3 id="60-the-pride-and-fall-of-man">§60 THE PRIDE AND FALL OF MAN</h3>
<p>The verdict of God pronounced in the resurrection of Jesus Christ crucified for us discloses who it was that was set aside in His death, the man who willed to be as God, himself lord, the judge of good and evil, his own helper, thus withstanding the lordship of the grace of God and making himself irreparably, radically and totally guilty before Him both individually and totally.</p>
<h3 id="61-the-justification-of-man">§61 THE JUSTIFICATION OF MAN</h3>
<p>The right of God established in the death of Jesus Christ, and proclaimed in His resurrection in defiance of the wrong of man, is as such the basis of the new and corresponding right of man. Promised to man in Jesus Christ, hidden in Him and only to be revealed in Him, it cannot be attained by any thought or effort or achievement on the part of man. But the reality of it calls for faith in every man as a suitable acknowledgment and appropriation and application.</p>
<h3 id="62-the-holy-spirit-and-the-gathering-of-the-christian-community">§62 THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE GATHERING OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the awakening power in which Jesus Christ has formed and continually renews His body, i.e., His own earthly-historical form of existence, the one holy catholic and apostolic Church. This is Christendom, i.e., the gathering of the community of those whom already before all others He has made willing and ready for life under the divine verdict executed in His death and revealed in His resurrection from the dead. It is therefore the provisional representation of the whole world of humanity justified in Him.</p>
<h3 id="63-the-holy-spirit-and-christian-faith">§63 THE HOLY SPIRIT AND CHRISTIAN FAITH</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the awakening power in which Jesus Christ summons a sinful man to His community and therefore as a Christian to believe in Him: to acknowledge and know and confess Him as the Lord who for him became a servant; to be sorry both on his own behalf and on that of the world in face of the victory over his pride and fall which has taken place in Him; and again on his own behalf and therefore on that of the world to be confident in face of the establishment of his new right and life which has taken place in Him.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-xv-jesus-christ-the-servant-as-lord">Chapter XV: Jesus Christ, the Servant as Lord</h2>
<h3 id="64-the-exaltation-of-the-son-of-man">§64 THE EXALTATION OF THE SON OF MAN</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ, the Son of God and Lord who humbled Himself to be a servant, is also the Son of Man exalted as this servant to be the Lord, the new and true and royal man who participates in the being and life and lordship and act of God and honours and attests Him, and as such the Head and Representative and Saviour of all other men, the origin and content and norm of the divine direction given us in the work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3 id="65-the-sloth-and-misery-of-man">§65 THE SLOTH AND MISERY OF MAN</h3>
<p>The direction of God, given in the resurrection of Jesus Christ who was crucified for us, discloses who is overcome in His death. It is the man who would not make use of his freedom, but was content with the low level of a self-enclosed being, thus being irremediably and radically and totally subject to his own stupidity, inhumanity, dissipation and anxiety, and delivered up to his own death.</p>
<h3 id="66-the-sanctification-of-man">§66 THE SANCTIFICATION OF MAN</h3>
<p>The exaltation of man, which in defiance of his reluctance has been achieved in the death and declared in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is as such the creation of his new form of existence as the faithful covenant-partner of God. It rests wholly and utterly on his justification before God, and like this it is achieved only in the one Jesus Christ, but effectively and authoritatively for all in Him. It is self-attested, by its operation among them as His direction, in the life of a people of men who in virtue of the call to discipleship which has come to them, of their awakening to conversion, of the praise of their works, of the mark of the cross which is laid upon them, have the freedom even as sinners to render obedience and to establish themselves as the saints of God in a provisional offering of the thankfulness for which the whole world is ordained by the act of the love of God.</p>
<h3 id="67-the-holy-spirit-and-the-upbuilding-of-the-christian-community">§67 THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE UPBUILDING OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the quickening power with which Jesus the Lord builds up Christianity in the world as His body, i.e., as the earthly-historical form of His own existence, causing it to grow, sustaining and ordering it as the communion of His saints, and thus fitting it to give a provisional representation of the sanctification of all humanity and human life as it has taken place in Him.</p>
<h3 id="68-the-holy-spirit-and-christian-love">§68 THE HOLY SPIRIT AND CHRISTIAN LOVE</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the quickening power in which Jesus Christ places a sinful man in His community and thus gives him the freedom, in active self-giving to God and his fellows as God’s witness, to correspond to the love of God in which God has drawn him to Himself and raised him up, overcoming his sloth and misery.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-xvi-jesus-christ-the-true-witness">Chapter XVI: Jesus Christ, The True Witness</h2>
<h3 id="69-the-glory-of-the-mediator">§69 THE GLORY OF THE MEDIATOR</h3>
<p>“Jesus Christ as attested to us in Holy Scripture is the one Word of God whom we must hear and whom we must trust and obey in life and in death.”</p>
<h3 id="70-the-falsehood-and-condemnation-of-man">§70 THE FALSEHOOD AND CONDEMNATION OF MAN</h3>
<p>As the effective promise of God encounters man in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, man proves himself to be a liar in whose thinking, speech and conduct his liberation by and for the free God transforms itself into an attempt to claim God by and for himself as the man who is bound in his self-assertion—a perversion in which he can only destroy himself and finally perish.</p>
<h3 id="71-the-vocation-of-man">§71 THE VOCATION OF MAN</h3>
<p>The Word of the living Jesus Christ is the creative call by which He awakens man to an active knowledge of the truth and thus receives him into the new standing of the Christian, namely, into a particular fellowship with Himself, thrusting him as His afflicted but well-equipped witness into the service of His prophetic work.</p>
<h3 id="72-the-holy-spirit-and-the-sending-of-the-christian-community">§72 THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE SENDING OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the enlightening power of the living Lord Jesus Christ in which He confesses the community called by Him as His body, i.e., as His own earthly-historical form of existence, by entrusting to it the ministry of His prophetic Word and therefore the provisional representation of the calling of all humanity and indeed of all creatures as it has taken place in Him. He does this by sending it among the peoples as His own people, ordained for its part to confess Him before all men, to call them to Him and thus to make known to the whole world that the covenant between God and man concluded in Him is the first and final meaning of its history, and that His future manifestation is already here and now its great, effective and living hope.</p>
<h3 id="73-the-holy-spirit-and-christian-hope">§73 THE HOLY SPIRIT AND CHRISTIAN HOPE</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the enlightening power in which Jesus Christ, overcoming the falsehood and condemnation of sinful man, causes him as a member of His community to become one who may move towards his final and yet also his immediate future in hope in Him, i.e., in confident, patient and cheerful expectation of His new coming to consummate the revelation of the will of God fulfilled in Him.</p>
<h3 id="the-foundation-of-the-christian-life">THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h3>
<p>A man’s turning to faithfulness to God, and consequently to calling upon Him, is the work of this faithful God which, perfectly accomplished in the history of Jesus Christ, in virtue of the awakening, quickening and illuminating power of this history, becomes a new beginning of life as his baptism with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The first step of this life of faithfulness to God, the Christian life, is a man’s baptism with water, which by his own decision is requested of the community and which is administered by the community, as the binding confession of his obedience, conversion and hope, made in prayer for God’s grace, wherein he honours the freedom of this grace.</p>

<p><strong>Making What They Say Something You Say</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve always believed that $$$</li>
<li>When I was a child, I used to think that $$$</li>
<li>Although I should know better by now, I cannot help thinking that $$$</li>
<li>At the same time that I believe $$$, I also believe $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introducing-something-implied-or-assumed"><strong>Introducing Something Implied or Assumed</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Although none of them have ever said so directly, my teachers have often given me the impression that $$$</li>
<li>One implication of X’s treatment of $$$ is that $$$</li>
<li>Although X does not say so directly, she apparently assumes that $$$</li>
<li>While they rarely admit as much, $$$ often take for granted that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introducing-an-ongoing-debate"><strong>Introducing an Ongoing Debate</strong></h2>

<li>In discussions of X, one controversial issue has been $$$. On the other hand, $$$ argues $$$. On the other hand, $$$ contends $$$. Others even maintain $$$. My own view is $$$.</li>
<li>When it comes to the topic of $$$, most of us will readily agree that $$$. Where this agreement usually ends, however, is on the question of $$$. Whereas some are convinced that $$$, others maintain that $$$.</li>
<li>In conclusion, then, defenders of $$$ can’t have it both ways. Their assertion that $$$ is contradicted by their claim that $$$.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capturing-authorial-action"><strong>Capturing Authorial Action</strong></h2>

<li>In making this comment, X argues that $$$.</li>
<li>X is insisting that $$$</li>
<li>X’s point is that $$$</li>
<li>The essence of X’s argument is that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disagreeing-with-reasons"><strong>Disagreeing, with Reasons</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>I think X is mistaken because she overlooks $$$</li>
<li>X’s claim that $$$ rests upon the questionable assumption that $$$.</li>
<li>I disagree with X’s view that $$$ because, as recent research has show, $$$</li>
<li>X contradicts herself /can’t have it both ways. On the one hand, she argues $$$, but on the other hand, she also says $$$</li>
<li>By focusing on $$$, X overlooks the deeper problem of $$$</li>
<li>X claims $$$, but we don’t need X to tell us that. Anyone familiar with $$$ has long know that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="agreeing-with-a-difference"><strong>Agreeing, with a Difference</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>I agree that $$$ because my experience confirms it.</li>
<li>X surely is right about $$$ because, as she may not be aware, recent studies have shown that $$$.</li>
<li>X’s theory of $$$ is extremely useful because it sheds insight on the difficult problem of $$$</li>
<li>I agree that $$$, a point that needs emphasizing since so many people believe $$$</li>
<li>Those unfamiliar with this school of thought may be interested to know that it basically boils down to $$$</li>
<li>If group X is right that $$$, as I think they are, then we need to reassess the popular assumption that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="agreeing-and-disagreeing-simultaneously"><strong>Agreeing and Disagreeing Simultaneously</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Although I agree with X up to a point, I cannot accept his overall conclusion that $$$</li>
<li>Although I disagree with much that X says, I fully endorse his final conclusion that $$$</li>
<li>Though I concede that $$$, I still insist that $$$</li>
<li>Whereas X provides ample evidence that $$$, Y and Z’s research on $$$ and $$$ convinces me that $$$ instead.</li>
<li>X is right that $$$, but she seems on more dubious ground when she claims that $$$</li>
<li>While X is probably wrong when she claims that $$$, she is right that $$$</li>
<li>I’m of two minds about X’s claim that $$$. On the one hand, I agree that $$$. On the other hand, I’m not sure if $$$</li>
<li>My feelings on the issue are mixed. I do support X’s positions that $$$, but I find Y’s argument about $$$ and Z’s research on $$$ to be equally persuasive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signaling-who-is-saying-what"><strong>Signaling Who Is Saying What</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>X argues $$$</li>
<li>According to both X and Y, $$$</li>
<li>Politicians $$$, X argues, should $$$</li>
<li>Most athletes will tell you that $$$</li>
<li>My own view, however, is that $$$</li>
<li>I agree, as X may not realize, that $$$, but $$$ are real and, arguably, the most significant factor in $$$</li>
<li>However X is wrong that $$$</li>
<li>However, it is simply not true that $$$</li>
<li>Indeed, it is highly likely that $$$</li>
<li>Nonetheless, the view that $$$ does not fit all the facts.</li>
<li>X is right that $$$</li>
<li>X is wrong that</li>
<li>X is both right and wrong that $$$</li>
<li>A sober analysis of the matter reveals $$$</li>
<li>Nevertheless, new research shows $$$</li>
<li>Anyone familiar with $$$ should see that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="embedding-voice-markers"><strong>Embedding Voice Markers</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>X overlooks what I consider an important point about $$$</li>
<li>My own view is that what X insists is a $$$ is in fact a $$$</li>
<li>I wholeheartedly endorse what X calls $$$</li>
<li>These conclusions, which X discusses in $$$, add weight to the argument that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entertaining-objections"><strong>Entertaining Objections</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>At this point, I would like to raise some objections that have been inspired by the skeptic in me. She feels that I have been ignoring $$$., “$$$,” she says to me, “$$$.”</li>
<li>Thus far some readers may challenge the view that $$$. After all, many believe $$$. Indeed, my own argument that $$$ seems to ignore $$$ and $$$</li>
<li>Of course, many will probably disagree with the assertion that $$$</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Naming Your Nay Sayers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Here many $$$ would probably object that $$$</li>
<li>However/But $$$ would certainly take issue with the argument that $$$</li>
<li>$$$, of course, may want to question whether/dispute my claim that $$$</li>
<li>Nevertheless, both followers and critics of $$$ will probably argue that $$$</li>
<li>Although not all $$$ think alike, some of them will probably dispute my claim that $$$</li>
<li>$$$ are so diverse in their views that it’s hard to generalize about them, but some are likely to object on the grounds that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introducing-objections-informally"><strong>Introducing Objections Informally</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>However/But is my proposal realistic? What are the chances of its actually being adopted?</li>
<li>Yet is it always true that $$$? Is it always the case, as I have been suggesting, that $$$?</li>
<li>However, does the evidence cited prove conclusively that $$$?</li>
<li>“Impossible,” some will say. “You must be reading the research selectively.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="making-concessions-while-still-standing-your-ground"><strong>Making Concessions while Still Standing Your Ground</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Although I grant that $$$, I still maintain that $$$</li>
<li>Proponents of X are right to argue that $$$. But they exaggerate when they claim that $$$</li>
<li>While it is true that $$$, it does not necessarily follow that $$$</li>
<li>On the one hand, I agree with X that $$$. But on the other hand, I still insist that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indicating-who-cares"><strong>Indicating Who Cares</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>$$$ used to think $$$, but recently (or within the past few decades) $$$ suggests that $$$</li>
<li>What his new research does, then, is correct the mistaken impression, held by many earlier researchers, that $$$</li>
<li>These findings challenge the work of earlier researchers, who tended to assume that $$$</li>
<li>Recent studies like these shed new light on $$$, which previous studies had not addressed.</li>
<li>Researchers have long assumed that $$$. For instance, one eminent scholar of cell biology, $$$ assumed in $$$, her seminal work on cell structures and functions, that fate cells $$$. As $$$ herself put it, “$$$.” Another leading scientist, $$$, argued that fat cells “$$$.” Ultimately, when it came to the nature of fat, the basic assumption was that $$$. But a new body of research shows that fat cells are far more complex and that $$$</li>
<li>If sports enthusiasts stopped to think about it, any of them might simply assume that the most successful athletes $$$. However, new research shows $$$.</li>
<li>These findings challenge $$$’s common assumptions that $$$</li>
<li>At first glance, teenagers appear to $$$, but on closer inspection $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="establishing-why-your-claims-matter"><strong>Establishing Why Your Claims Matter</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>X matters/is important because $$$</li>
<li>Although X may seem trivial, it is in fact crucial in terms of today’s concern over $$$</li>
<li>Ultimately, what is at stake here is $$$</li>
<li>These findings have important consequences for the broader domain of $$$</li>
<li>My discussion of X is in fact addressing the larger matter of $$$</li>
<li>These conclusions / This discovery will have significant application in $$$ as well as in $$$</li>
<li>Although X may seem of concern to only a small group of $$$, it should in fact concern anyone who cares about $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-meta-commentary"><strong>Adding Meta-commentary</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>In other words, $$$</li>
<li>What $$$ really means by this is $$$</li>
<li>My point is $$$</li>
<li>Essentially, I am arguing that $$$</li>
<li>My point is not that we should $$$, but that we should $$$</li>
<li>What $$$ really means is $$$</li>
<li>In other words, $$$</li>
<li>To put it another way, $$$</li>
<li>In sum, then, $$$</li>
<li>My conclusion, then is that, $$$</li>
<li>In short, $$$</li>
<li>What is more important, $$$</li>
<li>Incidentally, $$$</li>
<li>By the way, $$$</li>
<li>Chapter two explores $$$, while Chapter three examines $$$</li>
<li>Having just argued that $$$, let us now turn our attention to $$$.</li>
<li>Although some readers may object that $$$, I would answer that $$$.</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer, I’ve spent most of my reading/writing time working on a paper on Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 10. This paper is for the 2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium, and it has taken &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; longer than I originally anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I get to use this paper in my dissertation? I’m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I got excited, because, in my work on Genesis 1–3 last school year, I discovered some differences in how Barth and Bonhoeffer handled Genesis 1–3 vis-a-vis the subsequent history of Israel. Namely, while &lt;em&gt;Barth&lt;/em&gt; takes care to work his way from Eden to the Church only after moving through the history of Israel and Jesus, &lt;em&gt;Bonhoeffer&lt;/em&gt; jumps right from Eden to the Church via Christ. This difference in what I’m provisionally calling “Christological immediacy”—which is perhaps a confessional one that parallels some of the exegetical differences between Calvin and Luther—has me wondering whether Barth and Bonhoeffer differed in important ways on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer, I’ve spent most of my reading/writing time working on a paper on Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 10. This paper is for the 2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium, and it has taken <em>way</em> longer than I originally anticipated.</p>
<p>Will I get to use this paper in my dissertation? I’m not sure.</p>
<p>At first, I got excited, because, in my work on Genesis 1–3 last school year, I discovered some differences in how Barth and Bonhoeffer handled Genesis 1–3 vis-a-vis the subsequent history of Israel. Namely, while <em>Barth</em> takes care to work his way from Eden to the Church only after moving through the history of Israel and Jesus, <em>Bonhoeffer</em> jumps right from Eden to the Church via Christ. This difference in what I’m provisionally calling “Christological immediacy”—which is perhaps a confessional one that parallels some of the exegetical differences between Calvin and Luther—has me wondering whether Barth and Bonhoeffer differed in important ways on Israel.</p>
<p>If so, then perhaps a chapter devoted to their readings of Romans 9–11 would be in order! However, while Barth wrote about Romans 9–11 at least three different times (<em>Römerbrief</em>, <em>Shorter Commentary</em>, <em>CD</em> II/2), the closest that Bonhoeffer came to a lengthy exegesis of the passage was in his “Exposition on Romans 9–11 (Student Notes), Finkenwalde, September 28, 1935” (DBWE 14:868ff.). All we have are the following student notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans 9–11 Jewish Problem <a href="#">Judenproblem</a></p>
<p>Who is a Jew? Israel according to the flesh?</p>
<p>Chapters 8 to 9: concept of “election.” Jews “brothers,” 9:5 only passage where Christ is called God.</p>
<p>Verses 6–13 The children of Israel are not = σπέρμα but rather only those of the promise (not Ishmael, but rather Isaac). The σπέρμα does nothing, but rather the word of God that comes to the σπέρμα.</p>
<p>Verses 1–5 who: according to the flesh, who have the promises etc. Israel according to the flesh has received all [gifts] of the promise. Israelites, however, are only children of the promise. Only the elect, however, are children of the promise. They are children not through the σπέρμα but through election. But as the elect from the σπέρμα Ἀβραάμ. The real basis is election. The epistemological basis: σπέρμα. Not because they receive the kingdom of God. But rather as those who have come along, belong to it. Luke 19 … because he too is of the seed of Abraham.</p>
<p>Verses 14ff. Further: hardness of heart. Traced back to nothing but God’s. Hardness of heart traced back to election (cf. verse 12 Luther’s addition “by the grace of the one who calls,” where the Greek reads simply ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦντος).</p>
<p>Verse 17: Pharaoh’s hardness of heart serves to proclaim God’s glory in all the earth. (Chapter 11 also: Israel’s hardness of heart. God uses the hardness of heart of one person to convert another.) This hardness of heart has one goal: proclamation of the name. Perhaps also an end to it.</p>
<p>Verse 30—chapter 10:3 Here their guilt discussed. The election hardness of heart is at the same time self-incrimination.</p>
<p>Verses 4–8 The word of the gospel was already close to them (the Jews)!</p>
<p>Hardness of heart: 1. God’s will 2. Israel’s guilt 3. Calling of the others.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 Rejected? No, not rejected. Proof: he himself. God <a href="#">has</a> not rejected but hardened. λεῖμμα: remnant, new beginning (Elijah).</p>
<p>Verse 11 Have come so that they then stumble? No. Rather, this stumbling took place for the sake of the gentiles. Hardness of heart vicarious representative suffering for the gentiles, not without guilt, in that sense different from the Servant. Notion of vicarious representation remains. But guilt nonetheless.</p>
<p>Why did the Jews have to be hardened so that the gentiles might receive salvation? So that they crucified Christ (and Deutero-Isaiah?). It remains such that Israel is the missionary of the world, suffering in a vicarious representative fashion, and yet nonetheless because of guilt! Cross is culpable hardness of heart, which does not, however, relieve Israel of its mission task.</p>
<p>Vicarious representative action [Stellvertretung]: That means that God does not deviate from his plan. He uses guilt for this purpose. This cannot be understood morally.</p>
<p>Verse 15: Israel’s acceptance will come only with the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Verse 17ff.: If chosen branches have already been broken off, how much more so will a gentile be broken off.</p>
<p>Verse 25ff.: μυστήριον—prophecy.</p>
<p>Verse 28 quite clearly vicarious representative action, guilt, choice remains. God’s will, which is not clear, is carried out with regard to the Jews (election); they remain the beloved of God but ἐχθροί, for their and others’ salvation. Although it must happen (the betrayal), woe to whoever does it!</p>
<p>Now the question: Israel according to the flesh or through nature? or through the law?</p>
<p>What is a Jew? (DBWE 14:868–70).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, quite a bit less to go on than Barth’s handful of lengthy expositions of Romans 9–11!</p>
<p>And yet, Bonhoeffer did preach a sermon on Romans 11:6 (“But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace”) while he was in Barcelona (“Sermon on Romans 11:6, Barcelona, Oculi, March 11, 1928,” DBWE 10:480ff.).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, in a letter to his friend Walter Dreß, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Sunday I preached on Romans 11:6 and in the process realized that my previous understanding of dogmatics is being severely questioned by all these new impressions in a country that has known neither war nor revolution, neither a youth movement nor Spengler. It’s still difficult to articulate these impressions. In any case I now do have serious questions whether Barth could have written in Spain—whether he had any understanding at all for circumstances outside Germany. At the very least, given the circumstances here—both ecclesiastical and political—one really finds oneself forced to reassess one’s theology from the ground up. Just as I already had in Germany a theology of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, so too is the theology of the spring and summer momentarily taking the place of the Berlin winter theology.—Despite all my theological reservations, I read Wittig with a great deal of pleasure. I recommend you and Suse read him together. I’m also planning to get to Barth’s Dogmatics [Die christliche Dogmatik im Entwurf, that is] once more. It’s really worth reading (DBWE 10:76–77).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, before the sermon, Bonhoeffer had written in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My theology is beginning to become humanistic; what does that mean? I wonder whether Barth ever lived abroad? ¶Wittig’s Leben Jesu is making a very strong impression on me. ¶Tomorrow I am to preach here for the first time. I decided on Rom. 11:6 as my text, after having begun to work on many other texts (DBWE 10:64).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding this diary entry and the subsequent sermon, Reinhart Staats wrote (in the Editor’s Afterword to the German Edition of DBWE 10):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement should be understood within its proper context. What he comes to see more clearly is not what separates him from Barth but rather what he fails to find in the leader of the theology of revelation, namely, a humanistic theology focused on the whole world in its history. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Josef Wittig’s book Leben Jesu in Palästina, Schlesien und anderswo, which strongly influenced Bonhoeffer at that time, can also help explain this shift toward a “humanistic” theology. Wittig was a patristics scholar and Catholic writer who was for a time condemned by the Roman Curia for his “modernism.” In this book he presents a modern example of what discipleship to Jesus means, giving the Sermon on the Mount a central role and attesting Christianity’s openness to the world with the inclusion of antiquity: “The priest who is to become a new Paul must have been with Paul in Jerusalem, Athens, and Rome if he is to know how Paul would preach in Berlin.” Finally, even Bonhoeffer’s first sermon in Barcelona on the freely chosen passage Rom. 11:6 can help explain his diary remarks. This sermon addresses one of the basic Christian beliefs regarding grace (Bonhoeffer’s famous book Discipleship will first address the notion of “costly grace” in 1937): It is in God’s own goodness that “our gaze is opened to the entire world.” “Only one thing remains, namely, that God comes to human beings and bestows grace [,] the path from eternity into time, the path of Jesus Christ.” The critique of an ethic of principles that occurs for the first time in the Barcelona texts is thus also to be understood in connection with Bonhoeffer’s new personal experiences. This is “the great moral renewal Jesus brought about, the dismissal of principles.” <strong>The attendant critique of an unclear understanding of “religion” does admittedly correspond largely to Karl Barth’s critique of religion. Still, after Barcelona Bonhoeffer’s own theology is more humanistic, which also means that it is more ecumenical without imposing on his understanding of the Oikumene any institutional ecclesiastical elements</strong> (DBWE 10:627–29, <strong>emphasis added</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, perhaps there’s more going on with Romans 9–11 than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Of course, as far as Barth’s theological critique of religion goes, Romans 7 is more central than Romans 9–11. But, again, Bonhoeffer doesn’t have much to say about Romans 7, at least not in the form of a lengthy exposition. Nevertheless, for both Romans 7 and 9–11, Bonhoeffer might just have enough scattered mentions of the passages to make an interesting comparison of his and Barth’s exegesis of those passages possible.</p>
<p>The search continues!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: Here is the paper that I gave at the 2019 Karl Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at the Center for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#post-41871-footnote-1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#post-41871-footnote-2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>UPDATE: Here is the paper that I gave at the 2019 Karl Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at the Center for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church">INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”</h2>
<p>On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></sup> He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.</p>
<p>Of course, the very worst thing about supersessionism is that it implies that God is faithless and fickle. The next-worst thing about supersessionism is that it’s only a short step away from antisemitism and anti-Judaism. And yet, if Barth’s goal and our own is to interpret the book of Romans by ascertaining what Paul thought and spoke “in general and in detail,”<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup> then the worst thing about Barth’s somewhat supersessionist Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is not his equation of “Israel” with the “Church,” but rather his equation of “Gentiles” with the “world.” When it comes to Römerbrief chapter 10, there are actually good reasons for Barth to apply Romans 9:30–10:21 to the guilt of the Church, instead of Israel. However, glossing Paul’s “Gentiles” as the “world” makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pick up on Paul’s pastoral handling of the tensions between Jews and Gentiles within the Church. Paul is talking about the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians, whereas Barth is talking about the relationship between the Church and the world.</p>
<p>In order to make this point, I will first summarize Barth’s argument in Römerbrief 10, before assessing its strengths and weaknesses as an interpretation of Romans 10.</p>
<h2 id="summary-what-barth-is-doing-in-römerbrief-10">SUMMARY: WHAT BARTH IS DOING IN RÖMERBRIEF 10</h2>
<h3 id="the-krisis-of-knowledge-romans-930103-with-great-revelation-comes-great-culpabilitysup4post-41871-footnote-4sup">The KRISIS of Knowledge (Romans 9:30–10:3): With Great Revelation Comes Great Culpability<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></h3>
<p>The knowledge in question is the knowledge of God and the crisis is the judgment that humans are guilty. In fact, the crisis of knowledge is that both avoiding and pursuing the knowledge of God lead to guilt. <em>Avoiding</em> the knowledge of God <em>increases</em> the guilt and <em>pursuing</em> (and even receiving) the knowledge of God <em>reveals</em> the guilt. For Barth, the relationship between divine revelation and human plight is direct, not inverse.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>And yet, despite this direct correlation between revelation and plight, there is no escape from the judgment of God. There is no religiously privileged position from which the Church can judge Israel or the world. And there is no religion-<em>less</em> position from which the world can judge the Church. For Barth, as it is with Israel, so it is with the Church, and so it is with the entire world of ineluctably religious human beings.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Barth usually glosses “Israel” as the “Church” and “Gentiles” as the “world.” However, we should note that Barth is making an argument from the greater to the lesser when it comes to the relationship between Israel and the Church. He admits that the pinnacle of human religion, which is already the highest human possibility, is to be found in the history of Israel, asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can there be a ‘supreme’ religion, a highest pinnacle of all human work, in the relation between God and men? If such a religion were to be found anywhere, it would be in the ‘religion’ of the prophets and psalmists of Israel, which is nowhere excelled, certainly not in the history of Christianity, and not even in the so-called ‘Religion of Jesus’.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Barth is willing to mention Israel and Christianity in a differentiated manner. And yet Barth sees no religious evolutionary progress from Judaism to Christianity. The pinnacle of religion had already been reached in the history of Israel, before the history of the Church.</p>
<p>Now, of course, for Barth, to call something the “pinnacle of religion” is a particularly damning critique! And he immediate says that “a religion adequate to revelation and congruent to the righteousness of God, a law of righteousness, is unattainable,” except through the miracle of faith.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></sup> However, Barth is arguing that, if even Israel failed to attain the righteousness of God, then the Church will fare no better.</p>
<p>Although some might suggest that, given the direct correlation between revelation and plight, the best course of action would be to distance ourselves from the guilty Church, Barth maintains that there really is no escape from the solidarity of human beings under the judgment of God. He writes that “in the Church humanity becomes conscious of itself and is manifested as religious.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-8">[8]</a></sup></sup> Therefore, “in describing the Church we are describing ourselves.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-9">[9]</a></sup></sup> After all, Barth maintains that “in the affairs of God it is impossible for one individual to range itself against another, or one person against another. We cannot examine men, and then proceed to justify some and to condemn others.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-10">[10]</a></sup></sup> The knowledge of God, therefore, leads to a crisis, a judgment, a critique of ourselves and our best thoughts about God.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-11">[11]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3 id="and-yet-the-light-shines-in-the-darkness-romans-10421">And Yet, The Light Shines in the Darkness (Romans 10:4–21)</h3>
<p>Barth insists that, despite the Church’s tribulation and guilt, there is a way forward. But it is not pleasant. For Barth, “the hope of the Church” is manifest “precisely where its guilt is proven.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-12">[12]</a></sup></sup> The stone of stumbling, the rock of offense, is the only way forward. That is, in order to see the light of God that shines in the darkness, the Church must accept the judgment of God as her own, instead of trying to escape the judgment.</p>
<p>After all, on its own, the Church is desperately incapable. It is unable to have faith. It is unable to “do the law,” which, for Barth, means comprehending “that human righteousness comes into being only through the majesty of the nearness of God and of His election.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-13">[13]</a></sup></sup> The Church is unable to bring Christ near or to make Christ present. The Church can’t even negate its way to God!<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-14">[14]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Instead, the light shines in the darkness because God himself has already drawn near in Jesus Christ. Not, mind you, in a way that can be grasped and claimed by the Church as a possession. But, nevertheless, in an eschatological nearness that enables all human beings to call upon the Lord Jesus Christ and accept both the judgment and the salvation of God.</p>
<p>And yet, the light shines in “real darkness.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup></sup> Barth writes that “what is demanded of us here is that we should know that we are understood by God—in our lack of understanding.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-16">[16]</a></sup></sup> We best serve the Church by reminding it that even this demand exceeds its grasp. For Barth, we must not minimize but must instead emphasize “that the tribulation of the Church is its guilt, and that its guilt consists in a perpetual avoiding of the tribulation which it suffers from the secret of God.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-17">[17]</a></sup></sup> “The Church needs to be continually reminded of the most serious of all symptoms. It was the Church, not the world, which crucified Christ.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-18">[18]</a></sup></sup> Römerbrief chapter 10 was written as just such a reminder. With great revelation comes great culpability.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-what-should-we-make-of-barths-reading">ASSESSMENT: WHAT SHOULD WE MAKE OF BARTH’S READING?</h2>
<p>So much for a summary sketch of chapter 10. Let’s now assess Barth’s argument.</p>
<h3 id="first-barth-was-right-to-critique-the-church">First, Barth Was Right to Critique the Church.</h3>
<p>Previously, in chapter 9, Barth wrote that “in contrast with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, there is thrust upon our attention—Israel, the Church, the world of religion as it appears in history, and, we hasten to add, Israel in its purest, truest, and most powerful aspect.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-19">[19]</a></sup></sup> The first time I read those words, I’m pretty sure my jaw hit the ground. And yet, I believe that Karl Barth was right to use Romans 9–11 to critique the Church instead of critiquing Israel. He was right, in other words, to interpret Paul’s words “to all God’s beloved in Rome, who are called to be saints” (Rom. 1:7) as an internal critique of the Church rather than an external critique of Israel.</p>
<p>And, as far as an internal critique of the Church goes, I believe that Barth gives some very good advice to the Church. Instead of grasping for a religiously privileged position that does not exist, Barth urges the Church to submit to the judgment of God. Like a good prophet, he calls the people of God to repent. Consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were the Church to appear before men as a Church under judgment; did it know of no other justification save that which is in judgment; did it believe in the stone of stumbling and rock of offence, instead of being offended and scandalized at it; then, with all its failings and offences—and certainly one day purified of some of them—it would be the Church of God.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-20">[20]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, this sounds like Paul, who, right after proclaiming that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes (Rom. 1:16–17), then proceeds to cut everyone down to size by reminding them that there’s no human path to the righteousness of God apart from submitting to the judgment of God (1:18–3:20). Humble repentance, not positivistic boasting, is the correct human response to God’s gracious salvation.</p>
<p>I largely agree with what Gaventa recently argued at the 2019 Karl Barth Conference.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-21">[21]</a></sup></sup> On the one hand, Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is dangerous, because it leaves the door open for supersessionism, and wrong, because it “violates the plain sense of the text.” Yet, on the other hand, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 flows naturally from his emphasis on human solidarity and the qualitative difference between God and humanity in his reading of Romans 1–8. Furthermore, Barth’s prophetic and pastoral indictment of Christian arrogance coheres with other aspects of Paul’s letter.<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-22">[22]</a></sup> As Gaventa pointed out, throughout the letter, Paul appears to draw lines between human groups, but he then proceeds to erase those lines.<sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his critique of the guilty Church in Römerbrief 10, Barth is at least attempting to take the same posture as Paul. As a Jewish Christian writing to Christians in Rome, Paul took a posture of self-critique and solidarity with Israel. Barth therefore takes a posture of self-critique and solidarity with the Church.</p>
<h3 id="and-yet-barth-was-wrong-to-miss-the-jew-gentile-tensions-within-the-church">And Yet, Barth Was Wrong to Miss the Jew-Gentile Tensions WITHIN the Church.</h3>
<p>Exegetically speaking, using Romans 9:30–10:21 to critique the Church at least plausibly depends on Paul’s admission in the following chapter that he is speaking to “you Gentiles” as “an apostle to the Gentiles” (11:13). That is, the Gentiles among his predominantly Gentile Christian audience at Rome. At this point, we should recall that, in Romans 9:30–10:21, Paul is in the second stage of his argument that “It is not as though the word of God had failed” (9:6a). The first stage of his argument (9:6–29) was that “not all Israelites truly belong to Israel” (9:6b), “and not all of Abraham’s children are his true descendants” (9:7a). That is, membership in the people of God has always been determined by God’s gracious election—nothing else.</p>
<p>But what was the problem that necessitated this argument in the first place? Why, in other words, would anyone think that the word of God had failed? We get the answer in Romans 9:30–31: “Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith; but Israel, who did strive for the righteousness that is based on the law, did not succeed in fulfilling that law.” I take Paul to be referring to the fact that, at that time, the Church was becoming more prominently Gentile, and that the message concerning Jesus as the Messiah was getting a better hearing, as it were, among Gentiles than among Jews.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-24">[24]</a></sup></sup> If the gospel were “the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek” (1:16), then why was it receiving such a relatively poor hearing among the Jews? Did this imply some kind of faithlessness on God’s part? Had his word to his chosen people failed (9:6)? Was God being unjust (9:14)? Had God rejected his people (11:1)?</p>
<p>Paul’s answer to these questions in Romans 9–11 is an emphatic “No!” He argues for continuity in the saving works of God, despite the apparent discontinuity in the response of Jews and Gentiles to Jesus the Messiah. This argument about God’s faithfulness, then, has implications for both Jewish and Gentile believers—a mixture reflected in the original audience of Paul’s letter.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Paul elegantly interweaves critiques of Jewish and Gentile Christians throughout his letter. Here, in Romans 9–11, after critiquing the majority of Israel for not pursuing the “law of righteousness. . . on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works” (9:31–32), Paul springs a rhetorical trap, as it were, and accuses Gentile Christians of being no better than Jews (11:11–32). These critiques play a role in laying the foundation for what Paul has to say in Romans 12–16, especially to the “strong” and the “weak” in chapters 14 and 15.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-25">[25]</a></sup></sup> The pastoral heart of the book of Romans is arguably Paul’s exhortation to Jewish and Gentile Christians to “welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God” (15:7).<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-26">[26]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>In Romans 9:30–10:21, then, Paul is critiquing Israel for failing to follow her Law to its <em>telos</em>, Jesus the Messiah. But he is doing so in order to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians within the Church. Barth therefore at least has room to consider what role Paul’s critique of Israel should play for a Christian audience. So, although he should have said more about Israel, perhaps focusing on the Church in Römerbrief 10 was justified.</p>
<p>However, when Barth equates “Gentiles” with “the world” in Romans 9–11, he is sawing-off the exegetical branch he is sitting on. Paul’s critique of Gentile Christians vis-a-vis Israel in chapter 11 is the most immediate exegetical justification for applying the critique of Israel in chapters 9 and 10 to the Church. But, according to Barth, the “Gentiles” are “those outside” the Church. Commenting on Romans 9:30 (“What then are we to say? Gentiles, who did not strive for righteousness, have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith”), Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KRISIS appears here first. We have to recognize that, side by side with those who have knowledge and who are saints and children of God, there exist ignorant and unholy men of the world. However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness. . . . How can it be that the Gentiles, when confronted with the Church, are, and remain, Gentiles?<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-27">[27]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, Barth’s theological conclusions about the relationship between the Church and the world might be legitimate. But the fact remains that this is almost completely the opposite of what was most likely in the background to Romans 9:30–10:21. It was the Church’s relative success among the Gentiles and relative failure among the Jews that Paul had in mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Barth might be correct in his refusal to identify and quantify who is “in” and who is “out” when it comes to God’s gracious election. But, for Paul and his audience, “Jews,” “Gentiles,” the “strong,” the “weak,” and “doing the law” at least had concrete, visible ramifications. These things were not merely eschatological.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-28">[28]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>In his comments upon Romans 10:12–13 (“For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call on him. For, ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved’”), Barth writes: “But are these men within the Church, or outside it, or are they members of some Church of their own founding? The question is trivial.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-29">[29]</a></sup></sup> Why trivial? Because Barth maintains that these “faithful heathen” are an “eschatological quantity.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-30">[30]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>I disagree. Although Barth is absolutely correct to interpret Paul as arguing for (1) unity between Jews and Gentiles on the basis of (2) the judgment and the salvation of God, he is guilty of overlooking the fact that, for Paul and the Roman Christians, differences between Jews and Gentiles were still significant, even if they were not meant to be ultimate/final.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-31">[31]</a></sup></sup> Although Barth was right to use Romans 9–11 as an internal critique of the Church, the main problem with Barth’s reading of Romans 10 and Romans 9–11 is that, while Paul is speaking about Israel in order to address tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians, Barth is speaking about the Church’s relationship to the world.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-32">[32]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Borrowing Barth’s words from his preface to the English translation of Römerbrief, we might ask, after reading chapter 10 of the Romans commentary, “Did Paul think and speak in general and in detail in the manner in which [Barth has] interpreted him as thinking and speaking?” My answer would have to be “yes and no.” Yes, in general, but no in detail. Yes, in form, but no in content.</p>
<p>Yes, the internal critique of the Church is Paul’s. But, no, Paul was not primarily talking about the relationship between the Church and the world. He was primarily talking about the Church. Yes, Paul brought Jew and Gentile alike together under the judgment and the salvation of God. But, for Paul, the guilt of the Church was not its ignorance of its dialectical relationship with the world. Instead, for Paul, the Church is guilty primarily because of its internal divisions.</p>
<p>Is there a way to bring Paul and Barth together in Romans 9:30–10:21? I think and hope so. We might arrive at the same destination, with regards to the relationship between the Church and the world, but I think that, when reading Romans, we need to start with the divisions that exist within the Church. With great revelation comes great culpability. The Church cannot comprehend the nature of her division and divisiveness apart from her knowledge of God. “There is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all” (10:12). And yet the Church cannot afford to erase or forget the distinction between Jew and Greek from her own internal history.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-33">[33]</a></sup></sup> Within the Church, the light of Christian unity shines, but it shines in divided and divisive darkness.</p>

<p>In what follows, I will focus upon the second edition of Barth’s commentary. However, it is helpful to note that Barth made some structural changes in chapter ten between the first and second editions. In Römerbrief 1919, chapter 10 is titled “A Guilt,” and the section headings are: Clarifications (10:1–3); The Message (10:4–15); The Deaf Ears (10:16–21). Barth addresses Romans 9:30–33 in the final subsection, “The Stone of Stumbling,” in chapter 9, titled “A Plight” (Eine Not). <em>Der Römerbrief, Erste Fassung (1919)</em>, ed. Hermann Schmidt, GA II 16 (Zurich: Theologischer Verlag Zürich, 1985), 388–93; 394–426.</p>
<p>In Römerbrief 1922, Barth famously adds “the Church” into his chapter titles in 9–11. Chapter 10, “A Guilt,” becomes “The Guilt of the Church” (492–526). Furthermore, Barth moves Romans 9:30-33 into the beginning of chapter 10, combining them with 10:1–3 and calling the subsection, not “The Stone of Stumbling” or “Clarifications,” but rather “The KRISIS of Knowledge” (492–507). He also combines Romans 10:4–15 and 16–21 into a subsection titled, not “The Message” or “The Deaf Ears,” but “The Light in the Darkness” (507–26).</p>
<p>So, between the first and second editions, it seems that Barth is doubling-down on his application of Romans 9–11 to the Church (as seen in the chapter titles), while also attempting the follow the contours of Paul’s letter a bit better (by seeing a break at 9:30 rather than 10:1). Among others, Cranfield, Jewett, Moo, Schreiner, NA28 and the NRSV all see a break at 9:30. See C. E. B. Cranfield, <em>A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans</em>, ICC (New York: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004), 2:503; Robert Jewett, <em>Romans</em>, Hermeneia (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2007), 606; Douglas J.

<p>You’re in much greater danger in the Holy of Holies than in the casino or anywhere else. Or, to borrow one of Barth’s images, when the revelatory shell explodes, those closest to it bear the brunt of the impact. Barth writes that “the real basis for this suffering coincides with the suffering’s basis of knowledge” (der Realgrund dieser Not zusammenfällt mit ihrem Erkenntnisgrund). Furthermore, “if human beings did not know/recognize God, they would not be in the position to recognize their suffering as such” (Würde er [der Mensch] Gott nicht erkennen, er wäre gar nicht in der Lage, seine Not als solche zu erkennen) Römer II, 493.

<p>The quote continues: “The Church, however, which sings its triumphs and trims and popularizes and modernizes itself, in order to minister to and satisfy every need except the one!; the Church which, in spite of many exposures, is still satisfied with itself, and, like quicksilver, still seeks and finds its own level; such a Church can never succeed, be it never so zealous, never so active in ridding itself of its failings and blemishes. With or without offences, it can never be the Church of God, because it is ignorant of the meaning of repentance.” Barth, Romans II, 370. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-20">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaventa, “The Finality of the Gospel.” <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-21">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, as Gaventa noted, Barth perhaps took his cue from some of Paul’s “unsettling exegetical moves” in Romans 9–11, like Paul’s use of Deuteronomy 30 to refer to “Jesus” and the “word of faith,” instead of to the “commandment.” Or Paul’s use of Hosea to refer to the Gentiles, instead of to Israel. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-22">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, Paul plays on Jewish stereotypes of Gentiles in the second half of chapter 1, before springing a rhetorical trap in chapter 2! In chapter 4, Paul brings up Abraham as the father of both the uncircumcised and the circumcised. And in chapter 5, Paul puts Jew and Gentile together in Adam and in Christ. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-23">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was a problem for Paul, given the Jewish provenance of the “the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, the gospel concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh” (1:1–3). For more on the background and ethnic composition of Paul’s audience, see Jewett, Romans, 55–59, 70–72. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-24">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This point stands even though I admit that “strong” and “weak” probably do not exactly coincide with “Gentile” and “Jewish,” respectively. See Jewett, Romans, 70–72. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-25">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that it is legitimate to see Jew-Gentile tensions in the background here, because of what Paul then immediately says: “For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the <strong>circumcised</strong> on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the <strong>patriarchs</strong>, and in order that the <strong>Gentiles</strong> might glorify God for his mercy” (15:8–9, emphasis added). <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-26">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barth, Romans II, 363. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-27">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his comments upon Romans 10:4–5, Barth argues that both “the righteousness which proceeds from the faithfulness of God” (his rendering of ἡ…ἐκ πίστεως δικαιοσύνη, 10:6) and “the righteousness which proceeds from the law” are but two ways in which we encounter the one righteousness of God. “In the first case the righteousness of God is invisible (unanschaulicherweise), in the second it is visible (anschaulicherweise)” Romans II, 375; Römer II, 508. Nevertheless, in describing Paul’s quotation of Leviticus 18:5 (“Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes from the law, that ‘the person who does these things will live by them,’” Rom. 10:5), Barth writes: “This is what Moses means. By using the Futurum aeternum, he cannot fail to make us understand that neither the promise nor the condition which is linked to it is direct and observable. Both are used to denote the possibility which is messianic and eschatological” Romans II, 376–77. To say nothing of all of the many interpretive issues involved here, the fact remains that, for the “strong” and the “weak” in Romans 14–15, “doing the law” almost assuredly involved anschaulicherweise matters such as what was on the table when Christians dined together. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-28">↑</a></p>

<li>
<p>Barth, Romans II, 384. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-30">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This oversight, I believe, explains why Barth only devotes only 24 pages to his discussion of Romans 14:1–15:13 (Römer II, 671–700; Romans II, 502–26). He claims that “Truth and Mercy hold together Jew and Gentile, Church and World” (<em>Romans II</em>, 526), but he misses the fact that, in both Romans 9–11 and 14–15, Paul is focusing on holding together Jew and Gentile within the Church. <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-31">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be clear, Barth’s equation of “Israel” with “the Church” is also problematic. He should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel than he did. And this appears to be an error that he recognized and attempted to address. In his Shorter Commentary, Barth says much more about Israel than he did in Römerbrief. See <em>A Shorter Commentary on Romans</em> (Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2012), 110–47. Nevertheless, even there, Barth views chapters 9–11 and, indeed, 9–16 as someone of a digression from the main theme of Romans. Regarding chapters 9–11, he writes that “we are dealing with a second, comparatively independent part of the Epistle” (110). He applies the same judgment to chapters 12–16. Barth claims that “[a]ll that needs saying about that work of salvation, about the life that has been promised in the Gospel to the man who is righteous through his faith, has been said in what precedes” (110). I strongly disagree with this, and I think that Barth’s own hermeneutical principles should have prevented him from seeing the second half of the letter as only incidental to its main theme! What if, instead, Romans 9–16 were seen as the main point—at least pastorally—of the letter? <a href="#post-41871-footnote-ref-32">↑</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m scheduled to give a paper on Karl Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 in <em>Der Römerbrief</em> at the <a href="#">2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium</a> at Princeton in August.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it’s a pleasure and a privilege to give a paper at the colloquium. However, in hindsight, I don’t know why I thought giving a paper on chapter 10 of Barth’s Römerbrief was a good idea!</p>
<p>Granted, I don’t have to solve all of the exegetical issues (of which there are many) in Romans 9:30–10:21. I just have to make some sense of what <em>Barth</em> thought about the passage.</p>
<p>But, it turns out (surprise, surprise), it’s difficult to make sense of what Barth thought about Romans 9–11!</p>
<h2 id="barth-on-romans-911-in-der-römerbrief">Barth on Romans 9–11 in <em>Der Römerbrief</em></h2>
<p>If you haven’t read Barth’s <em>Epistle to the Romans</em>, here are his chapter headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Ninth Chapter: The Tribulation of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9:1–5. Solidarity</li>
<li>9:6–13. The God of Jacob</li>
<li>9:14–29. The God of Esau</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Tenth Chapter: The Guilt of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9:30–10:4. The <em>KRISIS</em> of Knowledge</li>
<li>10:4–21. The Light in the Darkness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Eleventh Chapter: The Hope of the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>11:1–10. The Oneness of God</li>
<li>11:11–24. A Word to Those Without</li>
<li>11:25–36. The Goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Barth then proceeds to lump all of Romans 12–15 into one chapter, “The Great Disturbance.” And Romans 14:1–15:13 is relegated to a 25-page subsection entitled “The <em>KRISIS</em> of Human Freedom and Detachment.”</p>
<p>Now, if you’ve read chapters 9–11 of St. Paul’s letter to the Romans, you might be wondering: “Where did Israel go?” Great question!</p>
<p>Barth makes the move from Israel to Church without slowing down. Commenting on Romans 9:1–5, after giving a summary of what he’s said about the gospel of Jesus Christ in Romans 1–8, Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now, in contrast with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, there is thrust upon our attention—Israel, the Church, the world of religion as it appears in history, and, we hasten to add, Israel in its purest, truest, and most powerful aspect. We are not here concerned with some debased from of religion, but with the ideal and perfect Church. (<em>Romans</em>, 332).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as someone who cut his teeth on the book of Romans in the wake of N.T. Wright, I’m pretty sure that my jaw hit the ground the first time I read that.</p>
<p>But perhaps I should have seen it coming! After all, earlier, commenting on “to the Jew first, and also to the Greek” in Romans 1:16–17, Barth wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no man who ought not to believe or who cannot believe. Neither <strong>the Jew</strong> nor <strong>the Greek</strong> is disenfranchised from the Gospel. . . . The Jew, the religious and ecclesiastical man, is, it is true, FIRST summoned to make the choice; this is because he stands quite normally on the frontier of this world and at the point were the line of intersection by the new dimensional plane (1:4) must be veritably seen (2:17–20; 3:1, 2; 9:4, 5; 10:14, 15). But the advantage of the Jew provides him with no precedence. The problem ‘Religion or Irreligion’—not to speak of the problem ‘Church or World’—is no longer a fundamental problem. (<em>Romans</em>, 40).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. So “the Jew” and “Israel” are both ciphers for “the religious and ecclesiastical man,” “the world of religion as it appears in history.”</p>
<h2 id="isnt-that-supersessionism">Isn’t that supersessionism?</h2>
<p>Without fail, Barth’s equation of “Israel” with “the Church,” built upon his apparent evacuation of “Jew” and “Israel” of all <em>Jewish</em> and <em>Israelite</em> content, raises the specter of “supersessionism,” the view that the Church supersedes, replaces, or supplants Israel.</p>
<p>After all, in a straightforward sense, Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist, because he literally replaces “Israel” with “Church” in his exposition!</p>
<h2 id="despite-this-its-become-increasingly-common-to-at-least-mitigate-the-accusation-of-supersessionism-against-barths-reading-of-romans-911">Despite this, it’s become increasingly common to at least mitigate the accusation of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11.</h2>
<p>Let me highlight a few of these defenses of Barth.</p>
<h3 id="katherine-sonderegger-that-jesus-christ-was-born-a-jew-karl-barths-doctrine-of-israel-pennsylvania-state-university-press-1992">Katherine Sonderegger, <em>That Jesus Christ Was Born A Jew: Karl Barth’s “Doctrine of Israel”</em> (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1992).</h3>
<p>In the chapter on <em>Der Römerbrief</em> in her examination of Barth’s doctrine of Israel, Sonderegger argues that Barth had a robust notion of solidarity between Israel and the Church, and that, thanks to his use of the figures of Prophet and Pharisee at least, “Barth does not discard history, empty it, or make it of no use or value” (42).</p>
<h3 id="r-kendall-soulen-karl-barth-and-the-future-of-the-god-of-israel-pro-ecclesia-6-no-4-1997-41328">R. Kendall Soulen, “Karl Barth and the Future of the God of Israel,” Pro Ecclesia 6, no. 4 (1997): 413–28.</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, Barth is perhaps guilty of at least a kind of supersessionism in his exposition of Romans 9:30–10:21 in Romans. Soulen has has provided a helpful diagnostic framework of three different kinds of supersessionism: economic, punitive, and structural.</p>
<p>In his own words,</p>
<ol>
<li>economic supersessionism “holds that from the beginning, God’s purpose for carnal Israel in the economy of salvation was destined to be fulfilled and completed by Christ’s coming, after which its place was to be taken by the church” (415).</li>
<li>Punitive supersessionism “holds that God has angrily abrogated the covenant with Israel because of Israel’s de facto rejection of the gospel” (416). And</li>
<li>structural supersessionism “refers to the fact that the classical model” (of the canon’s coherence, that is), “taken as a whole, tends to render the Hebrew Scriptures largely indecisive for shaping doctrinal conclusions about how God engages creation in universal and enduring ways” (417).</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Soulen interprets Barth as (1) repudiating punitive and structural supersessionism while (2) supporting and defending “economic supersessionism.”</p>

Harink, “Barth’s Apocalyptic Exegesis and the Question of Israel in Römerbrief, Chapters 9-11,” Toronto Journal of Theology 25, no. 1 (2009): 5–18.</h3>
<p>In his 2009 article, Douglas Harink argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 cannot be regarded as supersessionist, precisely because he rigorously subverts any historicist or heilsgeschichtlich readings of the relation between Israel and the Church. In this respect Barth’s dialectical reading follows Paul’s apocalyptic understanding of history, even though it must be corrected at points with a better reading of Paul” (5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Critiquing Barth, Harink writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In his “consistent eschatology” of the radical Aufhebung and Begründung of all things created, Barth yields to a temptation that always hovers on the edges of apocalyptic theology, perhaps even Paul’s apocalyptic theology: the temptation to see God’s apocalypse in Jesus Christ as dissolving all creaturely being in its delimited, differentiated character (including God’s creature-by-promise-and-election, Israel), rather than as destroying the powers that set creaturely beings at enmity with one another and in bondage to decay” (16).</p>

<p>Here is how Wesley Hill assessed Barth’s exegesis of Romans 9:1–5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is not to claim that Barth’s exegesis amounts to a repetition of Paul’s “original intention”; it is, rather, simply to suggest that Paul’s distinctions between Jew and Gentile, and unbelieving Israel and believers in Jesus, are destabilized and reconfigured in Rom 9-11 in such a way that Barth may be considered to be on Pauline ground when he presses and probes these various group descriptors—for example, “Jew,” “Israel,” “Gentile”— to see where and how they may expand to make room for fresh hermeneutical appropriation and application. A case may be made for seeing Barth’s exegesis, despite its weaknesses, as theologizing with, not against, Paul” (149).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this assessment, and also with Hill’s modification of Soulen’s charge of “economic supersessionism.” Barth is actually closer to <strong>structural</strong> supersessionism in the 1922 edition of his Romans commentary.</p>
<p>As Hill puts it, “Israel simply does not feature in any central way in Barth’s exposition of what by common consent is Paul’s most sustained, penetrating discussion of Israel’s role in God’s salvific purposes” (152n63). This sounds a lot like the “Israel-forgetfulness” that Soulen mentions in his description of structural supersessionism (“Karl Barth and Future of the God of Israel,” 417).</p>

<p>Susannah Ticciati suggests that Barth was right to put the Church in the place of “hardened Israel” in his <em>Römerbrief</em> reading of Romans 9–11. Yet, he was guilty of forgetting Israel, “eliding Jews and Judaism from discussion of the text.”</p>
<p>She writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“if the church today is going to understand itself as (part of) Israel, claiming the name Israel for itself (even if not exclusively), then it will not be long, or at least should not be long, before it recognises that it has itself become hardened Israel, no longer the marginal gathering around the apostles of Christ, but a well-established institution which cannot escape the kind of systemic corruption for which the prophets called Israel of old to account. This is one of the radical insights of Karl Barth’s Romans, in which Barth equates the Israel lamented by Paul in Romans 9 with ‘the Church’. I follow Barth in this insight here, but with the hindsight provided by the historical paradigm shifts summarised above, and therefore without eliding Jews and Judaism from discussion of the text, as Barth does in his commentary” (513).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her explanation (and justification) for Barth’s equation of the Church with unbelieving Israel, Ticciati writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Church is ranged with all other human possibilities (under the banner of ‘religion’) as that which God brings radically in question. To be sure, it is the canal where the living waters of revelation have previously flowed; but it is an empty canal which can neither compel nor constrain them. Thus ‘belief in Christ’, as a divine possibility, is not something the Church can lay claim to, either as such or by contrast with other human bodies. In Barth’s words (commenting on Rom 11.20): ‘But who is a believer? and who an unbeliever? Belief and unbelief are established only in God. For us they are unobservable, incomprehensible, and uncertain.’ ¶ It is only a small step to the recognition that the Church, as a mere human possibility – far from being the ‘us’ of Rom 9.24 – can only be hardened Israel” (515).</p>

<h3 id="beverly-gaventa-the-finality-of-the-gospel-barths-römerbrief-on-romans-9-11-2019-karl-barth-conference">Beverly Gaventa, “The Finality of the Gospel: Barth’s Römerbrief on Romans 9-11,” 2019 Karl Barth Conference.</h3>
<p>As it turns out, Beverly Gaventa just gave a talk on Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 at the 2019 Karl Barth Conference at Princeton.</p>
<p>Here’s her talk:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4-r_vUsvEc?start=65&feature=oembed" title="Beverly Gaventa | The 2019 Annual Karl Barth Conference - Lecture" width="750"></iframe>
<p>One of Gaventa’s central claims, then, is that “even with its serious flaws, Barth’s treatment of Romans 9-11 has a contribution to make to our understanding of Paul.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, then, Gaventa thinks that Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 is <em>dangerous</em>, because it leaves the door open for supersessionism, and <em>wrong</em>, because it “violates the plain sense of the text.”</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Gaventa argues that Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flows naturally from his stance on human solidarity given the qualitative difference between God and humanity as explained in his reading of Romans 1–8.</li>
<li>Is a pastoral/prophetic indictment of Christian arrogance.</li>
<li>Coheres with other aspects of Paul’s letter.</li>
</ol>
<p>What “other aspects” does Barth’s reading cohere with? Gaventa highlights some of “Paul’s ‘unsettling’ exegetical moves” in Romans 9–11, such as his use of Deuteronomy 30 to speak, not of the “commandment,” but of “Jesus” and “the word of faith.” Or his use of Hosea to refer to the Gentiles, instead of Israel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she points out that, throughout the letter, Paul <em>appears</em> to draw lines between human groups, but he then proceeds to <em>erase</em> those lines.</p>
<p>For example, Paul plays on Jewish stereotypes of Gentiles in the second half of chapter 1, before springing a rhetorical trap in chapter 2! Gaventa also notes how Paul handles Abraham vis-a-vis the question of circumcision in chapter 4. Paul then puts everyone together in Adam and in Christ in chapter 5.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-the-biggest-problem-with-barths-reading-isnt-supersessionism">What if the biggest problem with Barth’s reading isn’t supersessionism?</h2>
<p>I think that Sonderegger, Soulen, Harink, Hill, Ticciati, and Gaventa are all on the right track. It’s too easy to accuse Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 in the <em>Romans</em> commentary of supersessionism <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a mistake for Barth not to consider the particularities of Israel. This was a mistake that he began to address in his readings of Romans 9–11 in his <em>Shorter Commentary</em> and in the <em>Church Dogmatics</em>. But, as Soulen points out (and as Ticciati also argues in her recent chapter on Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11 in the <em>Dogmatics</em>), Barth never fully abandoned some form of supersessionism. For Barth, Israel and the Church always go together as two forms of the one people of God, but there’s an irreversible and, in some sense, asymmetric relationship between the two. The relationship between Israel and the Church moves from judgment to mercy, from hearing to believing, from passing to coming.</p>
<p>However (and here’s my contribution to this discussion), I don’t think that the (potential) supersessionism of reading “the Church” for “Israel” is the biggest problem with Barth’s <em>Römerbrief</em> reading of Romans 9–11.</p>
<h2 id="instead-i-think-the-biggest-problem-with-barths-reading-is-that-he-equated-the-gentiles-that-paul-mentions-in-romans-930-and-again-in-1111ff-with-the-world">Instead, I think the biggest problem with Barth’s reading is that he equated the “Gentiles” that Paul mentions in Romans 9:30 (and again in 11:11ff.) with the “world.”</h2>
<p>Barth thereby fails to recognize that Paul is speaking to/about Gentile <em>Christians</em>. He misses Paul’s pastoral focus on Jew-Gentile tensions <em>within</em> the Church, and instead focuses on the relationship between the Church and the world.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of the problematic equation of “Gentiles” in Romans 9–11 with the “world.” Commenting on Romans 9:30 (Τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν; ὅτι ἔθνη τὰ μὴ διώκοντα δικαιοσύνην κατέλαβεν δικαιοσύνην, δικαιοσύνην δὲ τὴν ἐκ πίστεως), Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The KRISIS appears here first. We have to recognize that, side by side with those who have knowledge and who are saints and children of God, there exist ignorant and unholy men of the world. However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness” (363).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking this notion to its conclusion, Barth writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet, suppose it be allowed and granted that there is also salus extra ecclesiam, that both Esau and Jacob can be elect, what becomes of the backbone of the Church, what confidence can it have in its own mission? Does the Roman Church, in advancing its own well – known claims, do more than protect the proper interests of every Church? What becomes of Israel’s following after righteousness, of its zeal for God, if it be granted that the goal has been reached by those ‘others’ who take no part in this zealous pursuit? Can the Church fail to recognize the reproach which is implicit in God’s undertaking to do, alongside of, and apart from, the Church, the work with which it has been entrusted, and which is the justification of its very existence? What attitude does the Church adopt to this reproach?” (365).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can leave the admittedly complicated question of <em>salus extra ecclesiam</em> aside for the moment. The main problem with Barth’s exegesis here is that this is precisely not what Paul is saying!</p>
<p>The “Gentiles” that have attained to the righteousness of faith are not some kind of “anonymous Christians” outside the Church. They are, instead, within the Church. When Paul writes in Romans 11:13 “Now I am speaking to you Gentiles,” he is not referring, as Barth claims, to the dialectical relationship between the Church and the world, but rather to the predominantly Gentile Christians in Rome!</p>
<p>In this respect, the main problem with Barth’s reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 is that his use of these verses to critique the Church plausibly relies on Paul’s admission that he is speaking to “you Gentiles” in 11:13. That is, the Gentiles among his Christian audience at Rome. On this basis, Barth therefore at least has room to consider what role Paul’s critique of Israel in 9:30–10:21 should play for a Christian Gentile audience.</p>
<p>However, Barth’s equation of “Gentiles” with the “world” prevents me from being able to justify Barth’s exegesis in this way! He’s effectively sawing-off the exegetical branch on which he’s seated! The only way that his reading of Romans 9:30–10:21 as the guilt of the Church passes exegetical muster here is if he can appeal to Paul’s clarification to Gentile Christians in Romans 11 that they are no better than Israel.</p>
<p>Barth is focusing so much on the solidarity—the dialectical identity—of Israel and the Church that he is missing Paul’s focus on differentiation within the Church. While Paul’s argument in Romans 1:18–3:20 supports Barth’s insistence that no human group has soteriological superiority over any other, Paul is more nuanced in Romans 9–11. He is doing something different, not merely repeating what he said in 1:18–3:20.</p>
<p>Barth writes that “However the Church be defined, it is encompassed by Gentiles and strangers, who do not comprehend, do not communicate with it, and do not follow after righteousness” (363; German original reads: “Die Kirche, heiße sie wie sie wolle, hat neben sich die Heiden, die Fremden, die Nicht-Verstehenden, die Unbeteiligten, die der Gerechtigkeit nicht Nachjagenden”).</p>
<p>That might be true, but that’s not the Paul is referring to <em>ethne</em> in this passage. The Gentiles are Christians!</p>
<p>Now, Barth is absolutely correct to interpret Paul as arguing for (1) unity between Jews and Gentiles on the basis of (2) the judgment and the salvation of God. However, at least here in the <em>Romans</em> commentary, I believe that Barth is overlooking the fact that, for Paul and the Roman Christians, differences between Jews and Gentiles were still significant, even if they were not meant to be ultimate/final.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-miss-the-jew-gentile-tensions-within-the-church-you-miss-the-pastoral-point-of-romans">If you miss the Jew-Gentile tensions <em>within</em> the Church, you miss the (pastoral) point of Romans!</h2>
<p>I agree with the thrust of Scot McKnight’s argument, in his recent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Romans-Backwards-Gospel-Empire/dp/1481308777"><em>Reading Romans Backward: A Gospel of Peace in the Midst of Empire</em></a>, that “Romans 12–16…reveals the pastoral context of Romans.”</p>
<p>(Here’s a webinar where Scot introduces his work.)</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/325227168?dnt=1&app_id=122963" title="Reading Romans Backwards Webinar Replay" width="750"></iframe>
<p>That’s why I think it’s so lamentable that Barth puts Romans 12:1–15:13 into a <em>single chapter</em> in the <em>Romans</em> commentary.</p>
<p>And the only thing that Barth can squeeze out of Romans 14–15 is self-critique—that we should read Romans against ourselves. That’s great, and it’s not foreign to Paul in Romans (as Gaventa points out), but it’s not exactly what Paul is up to in Romans 14–15!</p>
<p>Paul has very specific tensions in mind <em>within</em> the Christian community (communities) in Rome—tensions that had to do with Christians’ attitudes toward Jewish Law and traditions. And I think that McKnight is right to claim that Paul is speaking to the “strong” and the “weak” of Romans 14–15 throughout the entire letter!</p>
<p>Barth claims that “Truth and Mercy hold together Jew and Gentile, Church and World” (<em>Romans</em>, 526), but he misses the fact that, in both Romans 9–11 and 14–15, Paul is focusing on holding together Jew and Gentile <em>within</em> the Church!</p>
<p>The “strong” and the “weak” in Romans 14–15 were not necessarily “Gentiles” and “Jews” respectively. As Thielman notes, “the situation in mid first-century Rome was more complex than this simple division allows” (<em>Romans</em>, ZECNT, Zondervan, 2018, p. 629). Nevertheless, the identification of the “strong” and the “weak” almost undoubtedly had to do with Jewish customs, and not, as Barth seems to claim, merely with the extent to which one had grasped Pauline theology and the KRISIS of God.</p>
<h2 id="barth-seems-to-have-missed-the-pastoral-point-of-romans">Barth seems to have missed the pastoral point of Romans.</h2>
<p>Barth claimed, in the preface to Hoskyns’ English translation of Romans, that, “in writing this book, I set out neither to compose a free fantasia upon the theme of religion, nor to evolve a philosophy of it. My sole aim was to interpret Scripture” (ix).</p>
<p>It is unfair, therefore, to critique Barth’s exposition of Romans 9:30–10:21 in chapter ten of <em>Römerbrief</em> by simply claiming that Barth was intending to carry forward his theological critique of religion, and not interested in explaining what Paul had to say.</p>
<p>However, it is entirely fair to critique Barth’s work by holding him accountable to the text of Romans 9:30–10:21. He himself said so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proper criticism of my book can be concerned only with the interpretation of the text of the Epistle. . . . My book deals with one issue, and with one issue only. Did Paul think and speak in general and in detail in the manner in which I have interpreted him as thinking and speaking? Or did he think and speak altogether differently? The fourth and last request I have to make of my English speaking readers is therefore quite direct. Of my friendly readers I ask that they should take nothing and believe nothing from me which they are not of themselves persuaded stands within the meaning of what Paul wrote. Of my unfriendly readers I ask that they should not reject as an unreasonable opinion of my own what, in fact, Paul himself propounded. The purpose of this book neither was nor is to delight or to annoy its readers by setting out a New Theology. The purpose was and is to direct them to Holy Scripture, to the Epistle of Paul to the Romans, in order that, whether they be delighted or annoyed, whether they are ‘accepted’ or ‘rejected’, they may at least be brought face to face with the subject-matter of the Scriptures” (<em>Romans</em>, ix–x).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Especially when it comes to Barth’s equation of “Gentiles” in Romans 9–11 with the “world,” I do not think that Paul thought and spoke “in general and in detail” as Barth interpreted him.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;john-websters-idea&#34;&gt;John Webster’s Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many others, I desperately wish that John Webster were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, my dissertation topic owes much to his essay: “Reading the Bible: The Example of Barth and Bonhoeffer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay (previously published as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/tjt.17.1.75&#34;&gt;‘“In the Shadow of Biblical Work:” Barth and Bonhoeffer on Reading the Bible,’&lt;/a&gt;and then published in &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2Jlh1Ti&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word and Church: Essays in Christian Dogmatics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things at least are clear about the relationship of Barth and Bonhoeffer: that disentangling the history of their relation is of considerable importance for making sense of Bonhoeffer, if not of Barth; and that the disentangling is a rather delicate operation which involves some discriminating interpretation of the writings of two complex theologians. Much, for example, hangs on what we are to make of Bonhoeffer’s scattered remarks on Barth, revelation and non-religious interpretation in the prison writings, and of Barth’s puzzled response to them (87).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="john-websters-idea">John Webster’s Idea</h2>
<p>Like so many others, I desperately wish that John Webster were still alive.</p>
<p>After all, my dissertation topic owes much to his essay: “Reading the Bible: The Example of Barth and Bonhoeffer.”</p>
<p>The essay (previously published as <a href="https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/tjt.17.1.75">‘“In the Shadow of Biblical Work:” Barth and Bonhoeffer on Reading the Bible,’</a>and then published in <a href="https://amzn.to/2Jlh1Ti"><em>Word and Church: Essays in Christian Dogmatics</em></a>) begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two things at least are clear about the relationship of Barth and Bonhoeffer: that disentangling the history of their relation is of considerable importance for making sense of Bonhoeffer, if not of Barth; and that the disentangling is a rather delicate operation which involves some discriminating interpretation of the writings of two complex theologians. Much, for example, hangs on what we are to make of Bonhoeffer’s scattered remarks on Barth, revelation and non-religious interpretation in the prison writings, and of Barth’s puzzled response to them (87).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s Webster’s suggestion for making sense of the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rather than pursuing questions about positivism of revelation or about the worldly and ethical, light can be shed on the relation of Bonhoeffer and Barth by looking at the place of the interpretation of Scripture in their respective theologies. Both give a thoroughly theological depiction of reading Scripture, that is, a depiction in which language about God is direct and operative; both, therefore, define the human act of interpretation as radical attentiveness and self-relinquishment to God’s saving self-communication through the instrumentality of Holy Scripture. This, I suggest, is one of the points at which these two church theologians come very close to each other, and offer much food for thought to church and theology now (88–89).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My suggestion . . . is that an account of both Barth and Bonhoeffer, and equally an account of their relation, needs to give a good deal of attention to their writings on Scripture (90.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oddly enough, despite the mountains of secondary literature on Barth, Bonhoeffer, and their relationship, “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” is still a gap! As Webster notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Curiously, the significance of Scripture and its interpretation for understanding both Barth and Bonhoeffer has often been passed over rather quickly, and both have frequently been subjected to heavily conceptual interpretation (89).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, it appears to me that Webster’s essay—despite its many strengths—falls prey to his own accusation.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. Webster successfully (in my opinion) demonstrates that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Neither Bonhoeffer nor Barth were <em>wissenschaftlich</em> theologians; both were practical or pastoral theologians of the church of Jesus Christ. . . . Both, in short, were members of the guild, so despised by Kant and most of his heirs, of biblical theologians” (108–9).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, he does not address their expositions of specific biblical passages!</p>
<h2 id="my-idea">My Idea</h2>
<p>This, then, is what I would like to do.</p>
<p>I want to follow John Webster’s suggestion that, in order to understand Barth and Bonhoeffer, we need to take a closer look at how they read the Bible.</p>
<p>But I want to go beyond Webster’s essay in order to read specific biblical passages with Barth and Bonhoeffer. To get into the weeds, as it were, in the hopes of</p>
<ol>
<li>Clarifying the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship (especially <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/to-be-or-not-to-be-religious-a-clarification-of-karl-barths-and-dietrich-bonhoeffers-divergence-and-convergence-regarding-religion/">the apparent differences in their theological critiques of religion</a>)</li>
<li>Learning how to read the Bible theologically for the benefit of the Church today.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="barth-bonhoeffer-and-the-bible-where-to-begin">Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible: Where to Begin?</h2>
<p>The main challenge of a “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” project is limiting its scope.</p>
<p>After all, the quantity of Barth’s biblical material is massive. And, even though Bonhoeffer wrote much less, there’s still a fair amount of biblical material across his corpus!</p>
<h3 id="begin-at-the-beginning-genesis-13">Begin at the Beginning: Genesis 1–3</h3>
<p>Genesis 1–3 is perhaps the best place to begin. Not only is it the beginning of the biblical canon, but both Barth and Bonhoeffer wrote about Genesis 1–3 at length. Furthermore, Bonhoeffer’s interpretation of the <em>imago Dei</em> gets mentioned by Barth in the <em>Church Dogmatics</em>. And the various issues discussed in relationship to Genesis 1–3 are quite central to both theologians’ theological projects.</p>
<p>I have already demonstrated connections between (1) both theologians’ interpretations of Genesis 1–3 and (2) their theological critiques of religion. Furthermore, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/the-tree-of-religion-karl-barth-and-dietrich-bonhoeffer-on-the-tree-of-knowledge-in-genesis-24-324/">I’ve explored the connections between (1) their interpretations of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and (2) their similarities and differences when it comes to religion</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-possibilities">Other Possibilities?</h2>
<p>However, there’s much more beyond Genesis 1–3 to consider!</p>
<h2 id="bonhoeffer-and-the-bible">Bonhoeffer and the Bible</h2>
<p>On the Bonhoeffer side of things, his lengthiest expositions are found in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation and Fall (Gen. 1–3)</li>
<li>Discipleship (Matt. 5–7, 10; Various Pauline texts)</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/&#34;&gt;dissertation proposal&lt;/a&gt; approved in the Spring of 2018. Working title: “Scriptural but Not Religious: Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barth + Bonhoeffer + Bible + Religion. “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and Bible” is the gap/niche. But that would be too much to tackle comprehensively in a dissertation. So “religion” is designed to be the delimiter—specifically, &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/to-be-or-not-to-be-religious-a-clarification-of-karl-barths-and-dietrich-bonhoeffers-divergence-and-convergence-regarding-religion/&#34;&gt;Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissertation-wise, I didn’t make as much progress as I would’ve liked to during the 2018–19 school year. However, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/eva-joy-steele-a-birth-story/&#34;&gt;became a father&lt;/a&gt; and I passed all my courses. So I’m counting that as a win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">dissertation proposal</a> approved in the Spring of 2018. Working title: “Scriptural but Not Religious: Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion.”</p>
<p>Barth + Bonhoeffer + Bible + Religion. “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and Bible” is the gap/niche. But that would be too much to tackle comprehensively in a dissertation. So “religion” is designed to be the delimiter—specifically, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/to-be-or-not-to-be-religious-a-clarification-of-karl-barths-and-dietrich-bonhoeffers-divergence-and-convergence-regarding-religion/">Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion</a>.</p>
<p>Dissertation-wise, I didn’t make as much progress as I would’ve liked to during the 2018–19 school year. However, I <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/eva-joy-steele-a-birth-story/">became a father</a> and I passed all my courses. So I’m counting that as a win.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I <em>did</em> make some progress taking a look at what Barth and Bonhoeffer had to say about Genesis 1–3. Their <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/the-tree-of-religion-karl-barth-and-dietrich-bonhoeffer-on-the-tree-of-knowledge-in-genesis-24-324/">interpretations of the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil”</a> in Genesis 2–3 proved especially interesting.</p>
<p>Where does that leave me now? Well, my “Genesis 1–3” chapter has ballooned so much that I’m wondering if it might be best to make Genesis 1–3 the centerpiece/focus of the dissertation. I think that the necessarily broad net that I cast in my proposal (Genesis, Prophets, Gospels, Romans) was too broad.</p>
<p>The way I see it, a “Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible” project is primarily limited by the passages that <em>Bonhoeffer</em> wrote on at length. It would’ve been wonderful had the book of Romans played a key role in both theologians’ work, but Bonhoeffer didn’t engage with Romans all that much.</p>
<p>Not to discount Dietrich’s other biblical material, but Genesis 1–3, Psalms, and the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5–7) are the top three passages he did write on at length.</p>
<p>I’ll confess that I’m not entirely sure what to do with Psalms at this point, but handling <em>at least</em> both Genesis 1–3 and Matthew 5–7 is one of my main goals. I’m currently exploring Bonhoeffer’s discussion of Pharisees in <em>Ethics</em> as a possible organic connection between the two passages.</p>
<p>Another possibility, if I double-down on the theological critique of religion as a focus, is to restructure the project. Instead of each chapter being devoted to a passage of Scripture, I could have a chapter on (1) how Barth used the Bible to critique religion, (2) how Bonhoeffer used the Bible to critique religion, (3) similarities/differences between the two, and (4) how <em>I</em> would use the Bible to critique religion, building on B&amp;B’s work.</p>
<p>So, as you can tell, two years in, and it feels like several things are still up in the air! Thankfully, there’s plenty to think and write about when it comes to using the Bible to help explain the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship!</p>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m loving Logos Bible Software. I’ve got all of Bonhoeffer’s works in both English and German, as well as Barth’s Church Dogmatics and several of his other writings in English.</li>
<li>I <em>really</em> wish that (1) Barth’s <em>Gesamtausgabe</em> were finished, (2) translated into a critical English edition, and (3) available on Logos.</li>
<li>I still need to get better at German.</li>
<li>I’m working on a paper on Barth’s handling of Romans 10 in Der Römerbrief, for the <a href="http://barth.ptsem.edu/event/2019-barth-graduate-student-colloquium">2019 Barth Graduate Student Colloquium</a> at Princeton in August.</li>

      <title>Desperate Times, Desperate Measures: Writing My Dissertation vs. Funding Abortion</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/desperate-times-desperate-measures-writing-my-dissertation-vs-funding-abortion/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m two years in to my PhD program, and I need to finish writing this dissertation soon, or it’s going to be the death of me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I love Wheaton’s program. My supervisor and second reader are fantastic. And I think that this Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible project is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve got a wife, a kid, a commitment to the Church, and I need to move on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m two years in to my PhD program, and I need to finish writing this dissertation soon, or it’s going to be the death of me!</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I love Wheaton’s program. My supervisor and second reader are fantastic. And I think that this Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible project is worthwhile.</p>
<p>But I’ve got a wife, a kid, a commitment to the Church, and I need to move on with my life.</p>
<p>SO, in order to give myself a daily kick in the pants, I’ve used Stickk.com to commit to writing 500 words OR editing 5 pages (1,250 words), related to my dissertation, 5 days a week.</p>
<p>I got the 5-5-5 idea from <a href="https://twitter.com/pankisseskafka/status/1002981118482763777">Rebecca Schuman’s tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Academics, or anyone who has a long writing project, here is some gratis coaching. The ideal default pace is 5-5-5: 500 words OR 5 pages of editing, 5 days a week. Telling yourself that’s not enough is essentially giving yourself permission to do nothing. 5-5-5 will get it done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I don’t achieve this goal each week, $250.00 will go to an “anti-charity” of my choice. In this case, I’ve picked the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation.</p>
<p>I’d rather my money <em>not</em> go to this organization, so I plan to succeed in my commitment.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://t.co/Rc5Z8JW9ct">track my progress here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The precise meaning of the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil” (=TK) has long vexed interpreters of Genesis 2:4–3:24.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> While the “tree of life” (=TL) is mentioned and alluded to throughout the Bible, the TK is explicitly mentioned by its full name just twice (Gen. 2:9, 17).<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> Nevertheless, because of the significant role that the TK plays in the narrative, both Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Karl Barth highlight the TK in their theological interpretations of Genesis 1–3. Furthermore, both theologians describe the TK and the knowledge of good and evil (=KGE) in ways that resemble their theological critiques of “religion” as an improper response to divine revelation.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, I must first clarify what Barth and Bonhoeffer meant by “religion.” In <em>The Epistle to the Romans</em> and in <em>Church Dogmatics</em> (esp. <em>CD</em> I/2, §17, “The Revelation of God as the <em>Aufhebung</em> of Religion”), Barth developed a systematic definition of religion as idolatrous self-justification, which the early Bonhoeffer inherited.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></sup> As Barth defined it in the <em>Leitsatz</em> to <em>CD</em> §17, “the world of human religion” is “the realm of attempts by man to justify and sanctify himself before a willfully and arbitrarily devised image of God.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>However, although maintaining an emphasis on religion as self-justification and idolatry, in prison Bonhoeffer developed a historical/psychological definition of religion as an inward, metaphysical, and partial approach to human life.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></sup> Bonhoeffer described “the age of religion” as “the age of inwardness and conscience” which is now past.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup> He critiqued religion’s “metaphysical” emphasis on otherworldly escapism.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></sup> And, perhaps most importantly for what follows, he critiqued religion as a partial, fragmented, and segmented posture towards human life. In prison, Bonhoeffer wrote that “the ‘religious act’ is always something partial,” focused on distinctions between the outward and inward life, between human strength and weakness, and between religious and non-religious acts. However, for Bonhoeffer, “‘faith’ is something whole and involves one’s whole life.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-8">[8]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41779-Introduction"></a></p>
<p>In this paper, I argue (1) that Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s interpretations of the TK and the KGE help to explain the similarity and differences between their theological critiques of religion. For Bonhoeffer, the KGE is primarily “disunion.” What he would call “religion” in prison is an inward and partial response to the disunion caused by the KGE. For Barth, the KGE is primarily God’s prerogative to judge what ought and ought not to be. “Religion” is a repetition of humanity’s attempt to grasp the KGE and justify itself. Nevertheless, (2) given the text of Genesis 2:4–3:24, Bonhoeffer’s and Barth’s interpretations need some exegetical adjustments. Bonhoeffer’s view adequately describes the consequences of humans grasping the KGE, but it is insufficient to the degree that it fails to describe the essence of the KGE, how the KGE is spoken of in the rest of the OT, and how the KGE is originally and properly God’s. Barth’s view is more exegetically robust, but it needs to be softened in order to make it clear how humans now have the KGE. Yet, despite these adjustments, (3) I believe that the TK and the KGE can be used to advance a theological critique of religion along the same lines as both Barth and Bonhoeffer.</p>

<p>Although the links are admittedly indirect and thematic, I argue that the same similarities and differences can be seen in (1) Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion and (2) their theological interpretations of the TK and the KGE in Genesis 2:4–3:24.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-9">[9]</a></sup> Barth emphasized the relationship between the KGE (God’s prerogative to judge) and humanity’s idolatrous desire to justify itself. Although these elements are also present in some of Bonhoeffer’s discussions, Bonhoeffer places much more emphasis on the relationship between the KGE (disunion) and the fragmentation of human life.</p>

<p>“Good and evil” played an important role throughout Bonhoeffer’s theological career. Already in his February 1929 lecture, “Basic Questions of a Christian Ethic,” Bonhoeffer was using Genesis 2–3 to defend the claim that “[t]he Christian message stands beyond good and evil” because it emphasizes unity with God as opposed to the duality suggested by the oppositional pair “good and evil.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-10">[10]</a></sup></sup> Later, in January 1933, Bonhoeffer addressed the TK and the KGE in his lectures on Genesis 2–3.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-11">[11]</a></sup> In describing the primal state, Bonhoeffer emphasizes the unity of Adam’s life in “unbroken obedience to the Creator,” an “obedience that issues from freedom” to obey God’s command.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-12">[12]</a></sup></sup> In terms that echo his insistence in the prison letters on speaking “non-religiously” of God “not at the boundaries but in the center,” Bonhoeffer interprets the prohibition against eating from the TK as God’s boundary/limit [Grenze] which encounters Adam in the center [Mitte] of his own existence.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-13">[13]</a></sup></sup> According to Bonhoeffer, heeding the divine boundary in the middle of life was to secure human life in its unified totality. Instead, transgressing the boundary led to knowledge of good <em>and</em> evil, so that humans now “suffer from an inner split [Zwiespalt].”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-14">[14]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>This emphasis, on disunion and fragmentation, is by far the strongest theme related to the TK and the KGE in <em>Creation and Fall</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good and evil, tob and ra, thus have a much wider meaning here than good and evil in our terminology. The words tob and ra speak of an ultimate split [Zwiespalt] in the world of humankind in general that goes back behind even the moral split, so that tob means also something like “pleasurable” [lustvoll] and ra “painful” [leidvoll] (Hans Schmidt). Tob and ra are concepts that express what is in every respect the deepest divide [Entzweiung] in human life. The essential point about them is that they appear as a pair, that in being split apart [in ihrer Zwiespaltigkeit] they belong inseparably together.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bonhoeffer proceeds to discuss how, in human life, there is nothing pleasurable that exists apart from that which is painful, and vice versa. He writes that, “in all pleasure a person desires eternity, but knows that pleasure is transient and will end.” And, on the other hand, “in the depth of pain a person feels pleasure in transience, pleasure in the obliteration of apparently endless pain, pleasure in death.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-16">[16]</a></sup></sup> Bonhoeffer therefore draws a strong connection between the KGE and death as a necessary consequence.</p>
<p>Although Bonhoeffer later (in his discussion of Gen. 3:7) links the KGE with sexuality, the primary characteristic of KGE is still disunion. He writes that “the knowledge of good and evil is for Adam, who lives in unity, an impossible knowledge of duality, of the whole as torn apart.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-17">[17]</a></sup> This can be seen in the shame and division that the KGE yields in the relationship between Adam and Eve. Although Bonhoeffer links the KGE to both shame and conscience, he repeatedly emphasizes division and disunion.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>This emphasis on disunion resembles the distinction Bonhoeffer later makes in prison between “the religious act” as something <em>partial</em> and faith which involves one’s whole life.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-19">[19]</a></sup></sup> Religion distinguishes between (1) human strength, knowledge, and autonomy and (2) weakness, ignorance, and boundaries—exploitatively minimizing the former and emphasizing the latter.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-20">[20]</a></sup> ] Bonhoeffer also writes of the religious distinction between private/inner and public/outer life, claiming that “[w]hat used to be the servants’ secrets—to put it crudely—that is, the intimate areas of life (from prayer to sexuality)—became the hunting ground of modern pastors.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-21">[21]</a></sup></sup> In response to such “religious blackmail,” Bonhoeffer argues that “the Bible does not know the distinction that we make between the outward and the inward life.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-22">[22]</a></sup></sup> Although he does not mention Genesis 1–3 here, I think it makes best sense to interpret what Bonhoeffer calls “religion” in prison as an improper response to the disunion ultimately caused by the KGE.</p>
<p>However, with such a strong emphasis on division, in what sense, if any, does the KGE make humans “like God” (Gen. 3:5, 22)? Bonhoeffer at least attempts to make the link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There can at this point be no more doubt that the serpent was right in the promise it made. The Creator confirms the truth of that promise: Humankind has become like one of us. It is sicut deus. Humankind has got what it wants; it has itself become creator, source of life, fountainhead of the knowledge of good and evil. It is alone by itself, it lives out of its own resources, it no longer needs any others, it is the lord of its own world, even though that does mean now that it is the solitary lord and despot of its own mute, violated, silenced, dead, ego-world [Ichwelt].<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-23">[23]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it is unclear (1) how this description coheres with Bonhoeffer’s earlier descriptions of KGE as the source of disunion and (2) how such disunion could be an appropriate description of God. In order to link the KGE to God, it appears as though Bonhoeffer had to momentarily step back from his emphasis on disunion.</p>
<p>In 1942, Bonhoeffer returned to a discussion of the TK and the KGE in <em>Ethics</em>, particularly in the manuscript titled “God’s Love and the Disintegration of the World.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-24">[24]</a></sup></sup> Here again the emphasis is on the KGE as a split/disunion—a Zwiespalt, Zerfall, and an Entzweiung. In knowing good and evil, Bonhoeffer argues, humans fall away from reality into possibilities, and from knowledge of God into knowledge of self.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-25">[25]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, here Bonhoeffer, like Barth, links the fall to (1) humanity’s desire to be its own judge and (2) divine election.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-26">[26]</a></sup></sup> He also tries harder to describe how the KGE is God’s knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In knowing good and evil, they now know what only the origin, that is, God, can and may know. Even Holy Scripture speaks only with the utmost reservation about God’s knowing about good and evil. It is the first hint of the secret here of predestination, the secret of an eternal disunion that has its origin in the eternal One, the secret of an eternal choice and election by the One in whom there is no darkness but only light. To know good and evil means to understand oneself as the origin of good and evil, as the origin of an eternal choice and election. How this is possible remains the secret of the One in whom there is no disunion, since God is the undivided and eternal origin, and the overcoming of all disunion.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-27">[27]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for how/whether humans become “like God” when they obtain the KGE, Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have become like God—but opposed to God. This is the serpent’s deceit. Human beings know what is good and evil. They are not the origin, however, but instead have bought this knowledge only by paying the price of disunion from the origin. Therefore the good and evil that they know is not God’s own good and evil, but a good and evil opposed to God. It is a good and evil of their own choosing against the eternal election of God. As god-against-God [Gegengott], the human being has become like God.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-28">[28]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, in the end, due to the KGE, “everything is pulled into the process of disunion [Entzweiung].”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-29">[29]</a></sup></sup> Although Bonhoeffer arguably sounds a bit more like Barth when discussing the KGE in <em>Ethics</em> (as opposed to in <em>Creation and Fall</em>), Bonhoeffer still retains a distinctive emphasis on the KGE as the source of all disunion—with God, with others, and with ourselves. What he would later call “religion” in prison is an inward and partial response to this disunion.</p>
<h2 id="a-idpost-41779-barth_on_the_tree_of_knowledgeabarth-on-the-tree-of-knowledge-and-religion"><a id="post-41779-Barth_on_the_Tree_of_Knowledge"></a>Barth on the Tree of Knowledge and Religion</h2>
<p>Although Bonhoeffer offered a lengthy exposition of Genesis 1–3 over a decade before Barth, Barth had previously addressed these chapters of Genesis in his discussion of Romans 7:7–13 (“The Meaning of Religion”) in the second and subsequent editions of his <em>Römerbrief.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-30">[30]</a></sup></sup></em> In <em>Romans</em>, Barth interpreted the KGE as the divine secret that humans are merely humans. Such knowledge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is God’s secret. Men ought not to be independently what they are in dependence upon God; they ought not, as creatures, to be some second thing by the side of the Creator. Men ought not to know that they are merely—men. God knows this, but in His mercy He has concealed it from them. So long as ignorance prevailed, the Lord walked freely in the garden in the cool of the day [Gen. 3:8], as though in the equality of friendship.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-31">[31]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without undermining the creator/creature distinction, Barth nevertheless maintains that, before the fall, humans were (and ought to have remained) ignorant of the distinction. The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge <em>concealed</em> the creator/creature distinction and was meant to enable a direct relationship between God and humans. Instead, human disobedience revealed the distinction and led to the rise of religion, an independent action over against their creator.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-32">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Barth’s interpretation of the TK in <em>CD</em> differs sharply from his previous interpretation in <em>Romans</em>. Instead of referring to a divinely <em>concealed</em> distinction between creator and creatures, the knowledge of good and evil is <em>revealed</em>—precisely through the prohibition of eating from the TK—as God’s ability and prerogative “to distinguish and therefore to judge between what ought to be and ought not to be” (<em>CD</em> III/1, 257). This revelation of the creator/creature distinction was meant to prompt humans to acknowledge and praise their creator, thereby enjoying full fellowship with God. Instead, humans disobediently attempted to abolish the distinction. They thereby became like God, for “[t]o know good and evil, to be able to distinguish and therefore judge between what ought to be and ought not to be, between Yes and No, between salvation and perdition, between life and death, is to be like God, to be oneself the Creator and Lord of the creature.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-33">[33]</a></sup></sup> This usurpation of God’s KGE is a burden that creatures are unable to bear. It leads to the rise of religion as the idolatrous and self-justifying worship of false gods—including self-worship. But it also necessarily leads to death, for “[i]t is impossible for any other being to occupy the position of God. In that position it can only perish.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-34">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barth returned to Genesis 3 at some length in <em>CD</em> IV/1, §60, “The Pride and Fall of Man.” The <em>Leitsatz</em> for §60 describes the sinful human “who willed to be as God, himself lord, the judge of good and evil.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-35">[35]</a></sup> Barth continued to interpret the KGE as God’s ability and prerogative to judge. Furthermore, in Barth’s interpretation of Genesis 3 in <em>CD</em> IV/1, the primary concealment is not God’s concealment of the creator/creature distinction, but rather the serpent’s and humanity’s concealment of the pernicious nature of wanting (1) to be like God, (2) to be lord, (3) to be one’s own judge, and (4) to help oneself.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-36">[36]</a></sup> Regarding the desire to be one’s own judge, Barth argues that, not only do humans lack the capacity to judge between good and evil, they actively choose evil. And although the creator is in fact the judge, he is not the egotistic victor in need of approval that humans make him out to be in their endeavor to join him in judging. That is a false god, an idol. Instead, the true God is the self-sacrificial judge who gives himself to be judged in our place.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-37">[37]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="similarities-and-differences-between-barth-and-bonhoeffer">Similarities and Differences between Barth and Bonhoeffer</h2>
<p>The first similarity between Barth and Bonhoeffer on the TK and the KGE is that both theologians’ explanations of the TK/KGE correlate with their theological critiques of religion. For Bonhoeffer in prison, religion is an inward and partial attempt to address the disunion caused by the KGE. For Barth, religion is the same kind of idolatrous self-justification as humans grasping after God’s KGE. And yet both theologians speak of self-justification and a false idea of God at the fall. Given the paucity of citations of Genesis 2–3 in Bonhoeffer’s prison letters, it would be very difficult to “prove” that their differences on the TK and the KGE directly “caused” their differences on religion, but the correlations here should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Second, both theologians interpret the prohibition from eating from the TK as a gracious gift of God meant to secure a truly free relationship with human beings. Instead of God planting and then prohibiting the TK as a temptation or test, both Barth and Bonhoeffer claim that the divine command secures human freedom. God gives humans the opportunity to freely obey him and, therefore, to enjoy full fellowship with him.</p>
<p>Third, both theologians are trying to make sense of the contours of the passage, which seem to indicate that the KGE is (1) originally and properly God’s knowledge and (2) something that humans now have (Gen. 3:5, 22). But here is where their differences also begin to emerge. Bonhoeffer’s definition of the KGE in terms of disunion makes better sense of (2) than (1). That is, it is easier to understand how humans suffer from disunion post-fall than it is to understand how such disunion was originally and properly God’s. Barth’s definition of the KGE in terms of judgment and decision makes better sense of (1) than (2). It is easier to understand how God has the prerogative to judge between what ought to and ought not to be than it is to understand how humans now have such an ability.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-38">[38]</a></sup></p>
<h1 id="an-exegetical-evaluation-of-barth-and-bonhoeffer-on-the-tree-of-knowledge">An Exegetical Evaluation of Barth and Bonhoeffer on the Tree of Knowledge</h1>
<p>So far, I have argued that the similarities and differences between Barth and Bonhoeffer on the TK and the KGE help to make sense of the similarities and differences between their theological critiques of religion. I will now evaluate their interpretations of the TK and the KGE in light of the text of Genesis 2:4–3:24.</p>
<p>Regarding the meaning of the KGE, there have been several proposals, to say the least. Because every overview of the proposals slightly differs in order and scope, I find it most helpful to consider the proposals along a spectrum between those which make the most sense of how <em>humans</em> now have the KGE and those that make the best sense of how the KGE was originally and properly <em>God’s</em> knowledge.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-39">[39]</a></sup></sup> Moving roughly from the human to the divine, then, scholars have proposed that the KGE means: (1) sexual/carnal knowledge, (2) ethical discernment, (3) cultural advancement, (4) moral autonomy, (5) knowledge of everything or omniscience. There is also (6) the “consequence” view that the TK and the KGE are “a description of the consequences of obeying or disobeying the commandments.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-40">[40]</a></sup> I do not have space to give all the arguments for and against these positions. However, as an example of the reasoning often used to adjudicate between the positions, regarding the KGE as sexual/carnal knowledge fails to make sense of how the KGE was originally and properly God’s knowledge.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-41">[41]</a></sup> And regarding the KGE as omniscience fails to make sense of how humans now have the KGE.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-42">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>In terms of the framework I have just summarized, Bonhoeffer held a “consequence” view and Barth a “moral autonomy” view. Put simply, I think that Bonhoeffer’s view has difficulty explaining whether/how the KGE is God’s knowledge, and Barth’s view has difficulty in explaining whether/how the KGE is now also humanity’s knowledge. That is, an exegetical difficulty that both Bonhoeffer and Barth share is in making sense of Genesis 3:5 alongside 3:22. Taken together, those verses seem to suggest (1) that the KGE is a kind of knowledge that is appropriate to God and (2) that, though inappropriately seized, humans now have the KGE.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-43">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>I will begin by evaluating Bonhoeffer’s interpretation. As for Bonhoeffer’s claim that “[g]ood and evil, tob and ra, thus have a much wider meaning here than good and evil in our terminology,” he is correct (in both German and English).<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-44">[44]</a></sup> However, Bonhoeffer seems to be on much shakier exegetical ground when he claims that “[t]he words tob and ra speak of an ultimate split [Zwiespalt] in the world of humankind in general that goes back even behind the moral split, so that tob means also something like ‘pleasurable’ [lustvoll] and ra ‘painful’ [leidvoll] (Hans Schmidt).”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-45">[45]</a></sup> Although in Hebrew “good” can mean “pleasurable” and “evil” can mean “painful,” to arrive at such an “ultimate split” conclusion, one would have to consider whether or not this makes sense of how “good” and “evil” are used elsewhere in the Old Testament.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-46">[46]</a></sup> But Bonhoeffer fails to do so.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-47">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bonhoeffer’s emphasis on the KGE as an “inner split” and “disunion” clearly makes good theological sense of post-lapsarian human life. However, this seems to have more to do with the <em>consequences</em> of the KGE, and less with the <em>essence</em> of the KGE itself. Otherwise, it is difficult to understand how God has always appropriately had the KGE. Granted, Bonhoeffer does attempt to explain how humans are now like God: “Humankind has got what it wants; it has itself become creator, source of life, fountainhead of the knowledge of good and evil. It is alone by itself, it lives out of its own resources, it no longer needs any others, it is the lord of its own world. . .”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-48">[48]</a></sup></sup> However, it is difficult to understand how this coheres with his previous (and arguably primary) explanation of the KGE in terms of “pleasure” and “pain” always going together in “ihrer Zwiespaltigkeit.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-49">[49]</a></sup></sup> If, as Bonhoeffer suggests, the KGE means a Zwiespalt, Zerfall, or Entzweiung, then God’s words in Genesis 3:22 make little sense. The same goes for Bonhoeffer’s explanation of the KGE in terms of sexuality and shame.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-50">[50]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>And yet Bonhoeffer’s interpretation is not far off from a “consequence” view of the KGE. As Kidner puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[i]n the context, however, the emphasis falls on the prohibition [2:17] rather than the properties of the tree. It is shown to us as forbidden. It is idle to ask what it might mean in itself; this was Eve’s error. As it stood, prohibited, it presented the alternative to discipleship: to be self-made, wresting one’s knowledge, satisfactions and values from the created world in defiance of the Creator (cf. 3:6). . . . In all this the tree plays its part in the opportunity it offers, rather than the qualities it possesses; like a door whose name announces only what lies beyond it.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-51">[51]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Vlachos notes, this “consequence” interpretation makes good sense of (1) ידע as meaning experiential knowledge, (2) the consequence that actually takes place in 3:7, and (3) that the TL and the TK both seem to get their names from their effects—eating from the TL yields life, and eating from the TK yields the KGE.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-52">[52]</a></sup> So, perhaps Bonhoeffer’s interpretation is not as wide of the mark as it originally sounds.</p>
<p>And yet, there is the problem of Genesis 3:22. If Bonhoeffer is correct, how is the KGE originally and properly <em>God’s</em> knowledge? Even if 3:22 does not require an exact correspondence between human and divine knowledge, there seems to be something more going on here than just God knowing in advance what would happen if humans disobeyed. Therefore, while I do not think that Bonhoeffer’s interpretation of the TK and the KGE is in serious error (when viewed as a description of the <em>consequences</em> of human disobedience), it is insufficient. We need to make better sense of (1) how “good” and “evil” are used in the OT and (2) how the KGE is God’s.</p>
<p>These are both strengths of Barth’s interpretation of the TK and the KGE in <em>CD</em> III/1. Before arriving at the exegetical small print section, Barth relates the Eden narrative to the subsequent history of Israel.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-53">[53]</a></sup> Then, in the small print section, Barth first cites with approval the interpretations of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin. The common thread in their interpretations is, according to Barth, that “the tree itself has nothing whatever to do with evil, but like the prohibition is . . . . a kind of test. Everything depended on its formal fulfillment, so that there is no need to ask concerning its meaning and content and therefore the nature of the tree.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-54">[54]</a></sup> This resembles the “consequence” view of which Bonhoeffer was a proponent. Overall, Barth agrees with this interpretation that the TK was meant to establish “a proof of obedience and faith in the initiation of a relationship between man and God accomplished in man’s conscious decision.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-55">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, I agree with Barth that, because the TK is given a particular name and is said to mediate particular knowledge—a knowledge that led to death after humans disobeyed—“all this deserves much fuller consideration than is given to it on this view.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-56">[56]</a></sup> So, Barth then addresses the meaning of the KGE. He argues against the view(s) that (1) it relates to “science and our general knowledge of things,” (2) the prohibition of eating from the TK is about “progress from childish innocence” to the KGE as moral decision and “intellectual maturity,” and (3) the KGE refers to sexual knowledge and desire.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-57">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Having found these views unsatisfactory, Barth proceeds to survey what the OT has to say about the KGE. He argues that Deuteronomy 1:39, Isaiah 7:15–16, 2 Samuel 19:35 [Hebrew: 36], and even Jonah 4:11 are examples where the KGE “means the capacity—not yet possessed in childhood and perhaps no longer possessed in old age—to be responsible and to act.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-58">[58]</a></sup> However, Barth presses beyond this meaning, noting how other passages (Lev. 27:33; Gen. 31:24) seem to indicate decision and judgment. Furthermore, for Barth it is very significant that Solomon asks God from the ability to discern between good and evil, so that he might be a good ruler and judge (1 Kgs. 3:9). And, in 2 Samuel 14:17, David’s ability to discern between good and evil is compared to “the angel of God.” For Barth, these last two passages link the KGE to a judicial capacity of God.<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-59">[59]</a></sup> He then cites a long list of other passages from across the OT to demonstrate that “primarily and ultimately it is to God alone that this capacity belongs.”<sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-60">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>Based upon his survey, Barth returns to Genesis 2:16–17 and concludes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[t]o transgress the Word of the Lord means to do good or evil after one’s own will. But this is something which must not be done because it is God who must decide concerning good and evil, commanding the one and prohibiting the other, whereas man, choosing after his own heart, cannot attain good but will do evil. This, then, is what God prohibited. This is the possibility indicated by the tree of knowledge in the Garden of Eden but also prevented by the commandment.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-61">[61]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barth concludes that to know good and evil “is to know right and wrong, salvation and perdition, life and death; and to know them is to have power over them and therefore over all things.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41779-footnote-62">[62]</a></sup></sup> Here Barth comes very close to the view that “good and evil” is a merism, although he places more emphasis on discernment, judgment, and even omnipotence than on omniscience.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Barth’s moral autonomy view is perhaps cast in such strong terms that it suffers from the same weakness as the omniscience view. Although I am persuaded that, given how “good” and “evil” are spoken of in the rest of the OT, something like moral autonomy (stronger than mere ethical discernment) must be in view, the KGE should be defined as “mere” moral autonomy—the ability to make decisions about what is right and wrong—in order to help make it clear that, although humans now possess the KGE, it is but a pale imitation and coveting of God’s absolute KGE.</p>
<h1 id="a-idpost-41779-conclusionaconclusion-the-tree-of-knowledge-and-a-biblicaltheological-critique-of-religion-today"><a id="post-41779-Conclusion"></a>Conclusion: The Tree of Knowledge and a Biblical/Theological Critique of Religion Today</h1>
<p>In this paper, I have argued that (1) Barth and Bonhoeffer’s interpretations of the TK and the KGE help to explain the similarity and differences between their theological critiques of religion. For Bonhoeffer, the KGE is primarily “disunion”—with God, with others, and with ourselves. What he would call “religion” in prison is an inward and partial response to the disunion caused by the KGE. For Barth, the KGE is primarily God’s prerogative to judge what ought and ought not to be. “Religion” is a repetition of humanity’s attempt to exercise the KGE and justify itself.</p>
<p>Based upon the text of Genesis 2:4–3:24, (2) both Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s interpretations need some exegetical adjustments. Bonhoeffer’s view makes the best sense as describing the <em>consequences</em> of humans grasping the KGE, but it is insufficient to the degree that it fails to describe the essence of the KGE, how the KGE is spoken of in the rest of the OT, and how the KGE is originally and properly God’s. Barth’s moral autonomy view is much more exegetically robust, but it needs to be reined-in a bit in order to make it clear how humans now have the KGE.</p>
<p>Given these adjustments and a moral autonomy view of the KGE, (3) can the TK be used to advance a theological critique of religion along the same lines as both Barth and Bonhoeffer? Yes. With both theologians, we can maintain that the point of the TK was obedience to God’s command—a command which was also an instance of divine self-revelation. God is not against human beings acquiring ethical discernment and wisdom, but they are to do so through reverent worship and obedience in response to divine revelation, and not through attempting to seize godlike autonomy. If humans had obeyed God’s command, then the TK would have remained a tree of worship and wisdom, as it were, securing the unity and the freedom of human life. Instead, both in Eden and today, the error of religion is to grasp after God—to justify oneself before one’s own idea of “god,” instead of obeying and worshiping God as he has revealed himself to be. Because humans tried to grasp moral autonomy through consumption, instead of through worship and obedience, the TK thereby became the tree of religion. It would take an act of reverent obedience on a different tree to solve humanity’s religious predicament.</p>

<li>For the TL elsewhere, see Gen. 2:9; 3:22, 24; Prov. 3:18; 11:30; 13:12; 15:4; 2 Esdr. 2:12; 8:52; 4 Macc. 18:16; Rev. 2:7; 22:2, 14, 19. For an overview of the TL in modern theological thought, including Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s treatments, see Daniel J. Treier, Dustyn E. Keepers, and Ty D. Kieser, “The Tree of Life in Modern Theological Thought,” in <em>The Tree of Life</em>, ed. Douglas Estes (Leiden: Brill, Forthcoming). The identity of the tree in question in Gen. 3 is debated. However, the prohibition from eating of the TK in Gen. 2:17 makes it very likely that the TK is the tree that is in view from 3:3–21. <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-2">↑</a></li>

<li>With the exception of Barth’s discussion of Gen. 1–3 in chapter 7 of <em>Romans</em>, neither theologian discusses Genesis at length in their central theological critique of religion texts (<em>CD</em> I/2, §17; <em>DBWE</em> 8). However, in many ways, this indirect/thematic link is to be expected, because neither theologian (esp. Bonhoeffer in prison) made a habit of comprehensively citing all the texts related to their theological argumentation. <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-9">↑</a></li>

<li><em>CD</em> IV/1, 450–53. Although Barth does not use the term “religion” very often here in <em>CD</em> §60.2, the thematic resonances (particularly “unbelief,” “self-justification,” and “idolatry”) with his mature theological critique of religion in <em>CD</em> I/2, §17 make it likely that he has the problematic aspects of religion very much in view here. Compare Barth’s section on “Religion as Unbelief [Unglaube]” (<em>CD</em> I/2, §17.2, 297–325) with his description of “the pride of man” in terms of “unbelief” (<em>CD</em> IV/1, §60.2, 413–18). <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-37">↑</a></li>

<li>Another difference is that Bonhoeffer’s interpretation of the KGE was demonstrably influenced by Nietzsche*.* See <em>DBWE</em> 3:87–93; cf. 10:363, 366–67. For a good overview and analysis of Nietzsche’s influence on Bonhoeffer’s thought, see Peter Frick, “Friedrich Nietzsche’s Aphorisms and Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Theology” and “Nietzsche’s <em>Übermensch</em> and Bonhoeffer’s <em>mündiger Mensch</em>: Are They of Any Use for a Contemporary Christian Anthropology?,” in <em>Understanding Bonhoeffer</em> (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2017), 78–104; 105–26. Although both Barth and Bonhoeffer felt free to appreciate and critique Nietzsche, Barth’s interpretation of the KGE was arguably much less influenced by Nietzsche than Bonhoeffer’s. Note the lack of “beyond good and evil” language in Barth’s discussion of the TK and the KGE in <em>CD</em>. For Barth’s appreciative critique of Nietzsche, see <em>CD</em> III/2, 231–42. <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-38">↑</a></li>

<li>I agree with Day that the sexual knowledge view is the easiest to refute, because—although “to know” can refer to sex and the couple becomes aware of their nakedness after eating from the tree of knowledge—KGE is not used elsewhere to refer to sexual knowledge and God, whom the couple becomes “like” after eating (Gen. 3:22), is not portrayed in Scripture as a sexual being. Day, <em>From Creation to Babel</em>, 43. It is also difficult to understand how humans were to “be fruitful and multiply” (Gen. 1:28), or how Adam was to “cling to his wife, and … become one flesh” (2:24) without sexual knowledge. For arguments for variations of the sexual knowledge view, see I. Engnell, “‘Knowledge’ and ‘Life’ in the Creation Story,” in <em>Wisdom in Israel and in the Ancient Near East Presented to Professor Harold Henry Rowley</em>, VTSup 3 (Leiden: Brill, 1955), 114–19; Robert Gordis, “The Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Old Testament and the Qumran Scrolls,” <em>JBL</em> 76 (1957): 123–38. <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-41">↑</a></li>

<li>Although the omniscience view seemingly has support from other biblical passages (see 2 Sam. 14:17, 20; Job 15:7–8; Ezek. 28:3, 12) and makes good sense of “good and evil” as a merism, I agree with Day, who argues that this interpretation is out of keeping with the rest of Genesis 3, “which provides aetiologies of the state of humanity as the Israelites knew it, which was not omniscient.” Day, <em>From Creation to Babel</em>, 43. <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-42">↑</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>I acknowledge that (1) is contested by those who claim that Gen. 3:5 and 3:22 depict the KGE as belonging to “gods” or “divine beings.” This relates to the contested meaning of the first-person plural in Gen. 1:26. Nevertheless, I think that Gen. 3:5 and 3:22 are about God himself, as opposed to gods, divine beings, a divine council, etc. It seems most natural to take both occurrences of אֱלֹהִים in 3:5 as referring to the same person, and the first occurrence seems to refer to God, as opposed to divine beings. Gen. 3:22 is more difficult to adjudicate, but I take the first-person plural there as a plural of deliberation for much the same reasons as in Gen. 1:26. However, even if a divine council is in view, the KGE is still something that God properly has. For the arguments for and against the major positions here, see Hamilton, <em>Genesis 1–17</em>, 132–34, 208–209; Wenham, <em>Genesis 1–15</em>, 27–28, 85; and Westermann, <em>Genesis 1–11</em>, 144–45, 272–73; cf.

<li>Was Solomon asking God for an ultimate split in 1 Kgs. 3:9? Or consider the often-cited verses where “to know,” “good,” and “evil” occur together (Deut. 1:39; 2 Sam. 19:36 [English: 35]; Isa. 7:15–16). It is hard to see how they would be referring to an ultimate split that is present in human life, yet absent from both childhood and old age.

Vlachos also argues that this view makes good sense of Deut. 1:39 (“. . . your children, who today do not yet know right from wrong . . .”) but I am not convinced by this. Instead, I think that either moral discernment or legal responsibility is in view there. See W. A. M. Clark, “A Legal Background to the Yahwist’s Use of ‘Good and Evil’ in Genesis 2–3,” <em>JBL</em> 88 (1969): 274. <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-52">↑</a></li>

<li>See <em>CD</em> III/1, 267–76. For Barth, the “decisive parallel” is between the two trees and the revelation of God to his people. On the one hand, God’s revelation resembles the TL—the sign of God’s goodness and provision. On the other hand, it resembles the TK—a warning sign of God’s judgment. Barth links the KGE to the idolatry of the other nations from which Israel was supposed to keep herself distinct. Much like the prohibition from eating of the TK was meant to graciously protect humans from the inevitable consequences of usurping God’s role as creator and judge, God’s revelation to Israel graciously prohibits idolatry in order to protect Israel from necessarily dying when left to her own devices. <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-53">↑</a></li>

<li>Regarding (1), Barth thinks the phrase is much more specific/concrete. He also wonders why God would prohibit such knowledge, and why it would lead to death. As for (2), Barth points out that the knowledge comes from eating from the TK, not from avoiding it. It is also unclear why such moral discernment would be deadly. Regarding (3), Barth admits that the KGE results in the distortion of the sexual relationship between man and woman, but he denies that the OT anywhere condemns/discredits awareness of the sexual relationship. Even if the first consequence of the KGE was sexual, Barth argues that “the knowledge itself and as such is deeper and more embracing and cannot possibly be equated with sexual knowledge or its perversion.” <em>CD</em> III/1, 285–86. <a href="#post-41779-footnote-ref-57">↑</a></li>

<h2 id="introduction-thy-kingdom-haswill-come">Introduction: “Thy Kingdom [Has/Will] Come”?</h2>
<p>Just how <em>eschatological</em> is the Lord’s Prayer (=LP; Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4), particularly in light of its second petition, “Your kingdom come” (ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου, Matt. 6:10a; Luke 11:2d)? In other words, when will God’s kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)? Furthermore, who brings the kingdom about? Humans? God? Or some combination of the two? Settling the question of eschatology involves both the timing and the agency, the <em>when</em> and the <em>who</em>, of the kingdom.</p>
<p>When it comes to the LP, the literature is vast.<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> To get a grasp on the positions involved, Luz provides the following framework: “[t]here are essentially three basic types of interpretations in various combinations”: (a) the “dogmatic,” (b) the “ethical,” and (c) the “eschatological.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> The dogmatic interpretation views the LP as a summary statement of the Christian message/faith. The ethical interpretation views the LP as a guide for Christian living. These two interpretations have often gone together in the history of the Church. However,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[t]o these by no means mutually exclusive interpretations there has been added since the history-of-religions school (c) the <em>eschatological</em> interpretation, which relates the individual petitions more or less consistently to the eschaton and interprets the Lord’s Prayer from the situation of Jesus’ eschatological proclamation without regard for its relevance.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without discounting the importance of “dogmatic” interpretations of the LP, the relationship between the ethical and eschatological interpretations will be the focus of this paper. At this point, it helps to notice that discussions about the LP have tended to resemble discussions about the kingdom of God more broadly.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>When it comes to the kingdom of God, the question of the kingdom’s timing, the <em>when</em> question, has tended to dominate recent discussions.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></sup> There are three main schools of thought: (1) “already,” (2) “not yet,” and (3) “already-not-yet.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup> Again, note the connection between <strong>when/timing</strong> and <strong>who/agency</strong> in what follows.</p>
<p>First, scholars in the tradition of Albrecht Ritschl and Adolf von Harnack have interpreted the second petition to mean something like “Thy kingdom has already come, let it grow among us.” Consider Ritschl’s interpretation of the second petition: “On the lips of [Jesus’] disciples, the petition that God’s dominion may come presupposes that in the full sense this dominion has already been set in motion by Christ precisely in their own circle.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></sup> This fits well with Ritschl’s definition of the kingdom of God as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the divinely ordained highest good of the community founded through God’s revelation in Christ; but it is the highest good only in the sense that it forms at the same time the ethical ideal for whose attainment the members of the community bind themselves to each other through a definite type of reciprocal action.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-8">[8]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Ritschl and his ilk, <strong>the kingdom of God has already arrived (when/timing)</strong>, because it is a largely invisible ethical ideal (what), brought about by God in the inner lives of <strong>human individuals as they participate in his ethical agenda (who/agency</strong>, how, and where), in order to reveal God’s love and the value of humans in their relationships with one another (why).<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-9">[9]</a></sup></sup> I will refer to this interpretation as the “already,” “ethical,” or “non-eschatological” view.</p>
<p>Second, and in reaction to the “already” view, scholars in the tradition of Johannes Weiss and Albert Schweitzer have interpreted the second petition to mean something like “Thy kingdom has not yet come, let it arrive soon.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-10">[10]</a></sup></sup> For example, in his 1892 argument for the future, apocalyptic, and eschatological nature of the kingdom of God, Weiss himself argued that “[w]hat speaks more forcefully than all else” against an identification of the kingdom of God as already realized in Jesus’ disciples is “the fact that Jesus put in the mouths of his disciples . . . the words ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us be careful lest somehow or other we play down this fact and these words. The meaning is not “may thy Kingdom grow,” “may thy Kingdom be perfected,” but rather, “may thy Kingdom come.” For the disciples, the βασιλεία is not yet here, not even in its beginnings; therefore Jesus bids them: ζητεῖτε τὴν βασιλείαν (Luke 12:31). . . . We would import an opaque and confusing element into this unified and clearly unambiguous religious frame of mind were we to think somehow of a “coming in an ever higher degree” or of a growth or increase of the Kingdom. Just as there can be no different stages of its being . . . so likewise there are no stages of its coming. Either the βασιλεία is here, or it is not yet here. For the disciples and for the early church it is not yet here.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-11">[11]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Weiss and company, <strong>the kingdom has not yet arrived (when/timing)</strong>, because it is the visible apocalyptic and eschatological reign of God upon the earth (what and where), which will bring this age to a close (why). <strong>Only God can bring it about, and the best humans can do is to prepare themselves for its arrival (who/agency</strong> and how). I will refer to this as the “not yet” or “eschatological view.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-12">[12]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Third, scholars in the tradition of Joachim Jeremias, Werner Kümmel, George Ladd, and George Beasley-Murray have argued for some combination of present and future, non-eschatological and eschatological.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-13">[13]</a></sup></sup> Although the precise way in which the combination is achieved varies from scholar to scholar, an interpretation of the second petition along these lines yields the paraphrase: “Thy kingdom has already begun to arrive, let it arrive soon in its fullness.” These kinds of views are sometimes labeled “inaugurated eschatology,” as opposed to a “realized” eschatology (the “already” view) or a “futurist” eschatology (the “not yet” view). In addition to using this terminology, I will refer to this as the “already-not-yet” interpretation.</p>
<p>So, which is it? When Christians today pray “Your kingdom come” in the LP, does that mean that the kingdom is already here, that it is not yet here, or some combination of the two? Furthermore, do humans bring the kingdom about, does God, or some combination of the two? Again, note the connection between the <em>when</em> and the <em>who</em>, the timing and the agency, of the kingdom. Broadly speaking, to the extent that the kingdom has <em>already</em> arrived, <em>humans</em> participate in bringing about the kingdom. However, to the extent that the kingdom has <em>not yet</em> arrived, <em>God</em> brings about the kingdom.</p>
<p>It has become common either to argue that the LP is entirely eschatological, or that the first half of the prayer is more eschatological, while the second half is more ethical, focused on disciples’ daily needs.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-14">[14]</a></sup></sup> In this paper, I argue that, especially due to the noncompetitive view of divine and human agency in the first, third, and fifth petitions, the “already-not-yet” view does the best job of explaining the entire LP, with elements of the “already” and the “not yet” throughout the prayer.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-15">[15]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Introduction_Thy_Kingdom_HasWi"></a>According to the LP, the kingdom of God, I argue, is eschatological, but not otherworldly. It has ethical implications, but it is not thereby a non-eschatological ethical ideal. By “noncompetitive agency,” I mean that <em>both</em> God <em>and</em> God’s people hallow God’s name, do God’s will, forgive debts, and, I argue, bring about God’s kingdom—even as God is given the clear priority in each of those actions.<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-16">[16]</a></sup> In order to support this argument, I will make a cumulative case by working through the LP petition by petition, critically examining arguments for the “already” and “not yet” interpretations.</p>
<h2 id="a-idpost-41777-preliminary_considerationsapreliminary-considerations"><a id="post-41777-Preliminary_Considerations"></a>Preliminary Considerations</h2>
<p>However, before discussing the content of the LP in detail, I would like to briefly argue that the “already-not-yet” interpretation of the kingdom of God makes the best sense of (1) the “kingdom of God” content in the Gospels, (2) the content and context of the two versions of the LP (Matt. 6; Luke 11), and (3) the unity of the LP.</p>
<h3 id="a-idpost-41777-the_kingdom_of_god_in_the_gospathe-kingdom-of-god-in-the-gospels"><a id="post-41777-The_Kingdom_of_God_in_the_Gosp"></a>The Kingdom of God in the Gospels</h3>
<p>First, the “already-not-yet” position makes the best sense of the kingdom of God content in the Gospels. Due to the LP’s brevity, everyone has to appeal to evidence about the kingdom of God in the Gospels more generally. Although this paper is not the place for a comprehensive examination of the kingdom of God in the Gospels, I believe that an “already-not-yet” reading of the LP is supported but the fact that there are passages in the Gospels that seem to indicate that the kingdom is (1) present/already here, (2) imminent/coming, and (3) future/not yet here.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-17">[17]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Given this mixed bag of evidence regarding the kingdom’s timing, both the “already” and the “not yet” perspectives have to find some way to either ignore or reinterpret the passages used by the other side. Consider how Harnack ignored Jesus’ eschatological pronouncements by relegating them to his Jewish context, rather than his unique contributions to history. Responding to those who would claim that Jesus’ apocalyptic/eschatological pronouncements were primary and his ethical ones were secondary, Harnack wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this view I cannot concur. It is considered a perverse procedure in similar cases to judge eminent, epoch-making personalities first and foremost by what they share with their contemporaries, and on the other hand to put what is great and characteristic in them into the background. . . . There can be no doubt about the fact that the idea of the two kingdoms, of God and of the devil, and their conflicts, and of that last conflict at some future time when the devil, long since cast out of heaven, will be also defeated on earth, was an idea which Jesus simply shared with his contemporaries. He did not start it, but he grew up in it and he retained it. The other view, however, that the kingdom of God ‘cometh not with observation,’ that it is already here, was his own.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-18">[18]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Weiss claimed that, if Jesus had contradicted his contemporaries’ eschatological conceptions of the kingdom, he would have done so (and the evangelists would have highlighted it) much more explicitly.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-19">[19]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, he argued that the parables that seem to indicate that the kingdom is present (such as the parables of the seed growing secretly, tares, mustard seed, and leaven) are really about something else, such as “the fate of the proclaimed word.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-20">[20]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to both of these approaches, the “already-not-yet” reading does the best job of making sense of the entire body of evidence we have regarding the kingdom of God in the Gospels.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-21">[21]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-content-and-contexts-of-the-two-versions-of-the-lp">The Content and Contexts of the Two Versions of the LP</h3>
<p>Second, the “already-not-yet” position helps to make good sense of the content and contexts of the two versions of the LP (Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4), without having to play them against each other. It is intriguing to note the similarities in the differences between the Beatitudes and the LP in Matthew and Luke. Both sets of differences can be interpreted as Luke mitigating Matthew’s eschatological focus with his own emphasis on the ethical. As Houlden observes, the content of Luke’s LP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is probably best seen, as far as Luke’s intention goes, as diverging from Matthew in the more practical and ethical way in which it sees the life of the kingdom. In this, too, as in its pithiness, it is parallel to his treatment of the Beatitudes (6:20-22). Line 5 in particular seems to substitute a concern with daily bread for Matthew’s hope for the “bread of the kingdom”. . . ; just as his blessing (6:21) is for those who “hunger now” rather than Matthew’s “hunger and thirst for righteousness” (5:6) and for the poor (6:21) rather than the “poor in spirit” (Matt 5:3). We recall, too, the strongly realistic picture of the new order Jesus brings depicted in the Nazareth sermon in Luke 4:16-20. It is possible that in line 7 Luke edges the sense of “temptation” toward a notion of everyday testing of faith in various moral predicaments and away from the ultimate (eschatological) test that will precede the End and that Matthew presumably has in mind.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-22">[22]</a></sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="post-41777-The_Two_Versions_and_Contexts_"></a> And yet, even if it is legitimate to see Matthew’s LP as placing slightly more emphasis on the “not yet” than Luke’s LP, it is equally important to note the contexts of the two versions, which, I suggest, seem to push in the opposite directions. That is, while Matthew’s LP perhaps emphasizes the “not yet,” its placement in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount should militate against a strong divide between eschatology and ethics. And, while Luke’s LP perhaps emphasizes the “already,” its introduction as a distinctive communal prayer of Jesus’ disciples (vis-a-vis John’s, see Luke 11:1) should militate against a collapsing of the LP into an ethical ideal for individuals.<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Whereas a thoroughgoing “already” reading would have to find some way to account for the eschatological emphases in the content of Matthew’s LP and the context of Luke’s, and thoroughgoing “not yet” reading would have to find some way to account for the ethical emphases in the content of Luke’s LP and the context of Matthew’s, an “already-not-yet” reading is able to allow both the content and the contexts of the two versions of the LP to stand in helpful tension.</p>
<h3 id="the-unity-of-the-lp">The Unity of the LP</h3>
<p>Third, an “already-not-yet” reading makes the best sense of the unity of the LP. In both Matthew and Luke, there is a clear twofold structure, delineated by the shift from the second-person singular (Matt. 6:9–10; Luke 11:2) to the first-person plural (Matt. 6:11–13; Luke 11:3–4). At first glance, there appears to be a shift from the eschatological to the ethical, from God and the coming of his kingdom to the daily needs of God’s people. However, I will argue below that this oversimplifies things and that there is an interweaving of the “already” and the “not yet” throughout the prayer. I therefore believe that an “already-not-yet” reading of the prayer does the best job of securing the unity of the LP.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-24">[24]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h2 id="our-father-in-heaven-πάτερ-ἡμῶν-ὁ-ἐν-τοῖς-οὐρανοῖς-matt-69b-par-luke-112b">Our Father in heaven (Πάτερ ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς; Matt. 6:9b; par. Luke 11:2b)</h2>
<p>When it comes to the opening words of the LP, there has been a longstanding debate on just how innovative and unique Jesus’ address of God as “father” (Πάτερ) was. Jeremias argued for the underlying Aramaic <em>abba</em>, claiming that Jesus’ address of God as such was entirely unique in his context, transcending a Jewish view of God with one of childlike intimacy.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-25">[25]</a></sup></sup> As can be seen in Harnack’s well-known emphasis of “the fatherhood of God” as one of the pillars of Jesus’ kingdom proclamation, a non-eschatological reading of the LP emphasizes the distinctiveness of addressing God in such intimate terms.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-26">[26]</a></sup></sup> At first glance, then, the “already” reading seems to win out.</p>
<p>However, Jeremias’ arguments about <em>abba</em>/father have come under criticism in subsequent decades.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-27">[27]</a></sup></sup> It is now recognized that, although Jesus’ use of the Aramaic <em>abba</em> was perhaps distinctive, referring to God as father was not.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-28">[28]</a></sup></sup> Rather than overplaying the uniqueness of Jesus vis-a-vis his Jewish context, it seems far better to note the profound connections between “our father” and the narrative of the Hebrew Bible.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-29">[29]</a></sup></sup> I agree with Perrin, who argues (based on, among other passages, Jeremiah 3:18–19 and Exodus 4:22–23) that the language of God as father recalls the covenantal relationship between God and his people—a relationship that spans from Abraham to Moses through exodus, from David to Jesus through exile, and from Jesus to his followers through new exodus and return from exile.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-30">[30]</a></sup></sup> The covenantal resonances would also seem to suggest the importance of covenantal faithfulness on the part of those praying “our father,” and not just on God’s part alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the combination of Matthew’s “our father” with Luke’s introduction of the LP vis-a-vis John’s disciples (Luke 11:1) suggests a distinctive communal emphasis here. As mentioned above, this emphasis seems to militate against the “already” position’s tendency to collapse the kingdom of God into an ethical ideal for individuals. Nevertheless, I will argue below that this communal emphasis should shape our understanding of both God and his people hallowing God’s name and doing God’s will.</p>
<p>Finally, although the phrase “in heaven” (ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς) surely <em>at least</em> distinguishes between God and earthly fathers (see Matt. 23:9), the difference is already so sufficiently obvious that it most likely is doing more.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-31">[31]</a></sup></sup> At the very least, “in heaven” (6:9b), along with “on earth as in heaven” (ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς; 6:10c) does suggest a dualistic emphasis on otherworldly realms common in apocalyptic eschatology.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-32">[32]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Our_Father_in_heaven"></a></p>
<p>On balance, then, “our father in heaven,” despite an ethical reading’s emphasis on the fatherhood of God, seems to support the eschatological reading. Indeed, theologically-speaking, it is hard to imagine a petitionary prayer that does not have at least an eschatological component, given that a request is being made to God, presumably regarding something that is not already the case! However, the covenantal resonances in “our father” at least open to the door to a non-competitive account of divine and human agency in which covenantal faithfulness is the main concern.</p>
<h2 id="a-idpost-41777-your_kingdom_come_matt_6ayour-kingdom-come-matt-69c10-par-luke-112cd"><a id="post-41777-Your_Kingdom_Come_Matt_6"></a>Your Kingdom Come (Matt. 6:9c–10; par. Luke 11:2c–d)</h2>
<p>A core of my argument is that the petitions in the first half of the LP are mutually interpreting. That is, for both Matthew and Luke, for God’s kingdom to come means that his name is hallowed—by both God and God’s people. And, for Matthew, it means that God’s name is hallowed and his will is done on earth—by both God and God’s people—as both of those things are already done in heaven. The grammatical structure of the petitions seems to at least allow for—if not support—this reading. After all, the subject of the verbs ἁγιασθήτω, ἐλθέτω and γενηθήτω is not God (though he is being addressed), but rather God’s name, kingdom, and will.</p>
<p>Therefore, although “your kingdom come,” if read on its own, <em>might</em> be clearly eschatological, as interpreted by the other two positions, it is best read as an “already-not-yet” request involving both divine and human agency coming together in a noncompetitive way. It is not an either/or but a both/and. God’s name is hallowed and his will is done by both God and his people. Therefore, this noncompetitive agency should, I argue, extend to the second petition as well. God brings the kingdom, but his people participate in this process.</p>
<h2 id="a-idpost-41777-hallowed_be_your_nameahallowed-be-your-name-ἁγιασθήτω-τὸ-ὄνομά-σου-matt-69c-par-luke-112c"><a id="post-41777-Hallowed_be_your_name"></a>Hallowed be your name (ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου; Matt. 6:9c; par. Luke 11:2c)</h2>
<p>God’s “name” refers to his reputation, essence, and identity. It is already holy (Lev. 20:3; Ps. 30:4; Isa. 57:15; Ezek. 20:39; Amos 2:7). So ἁγιάζω here means not “to make holy,” but rather “to treat or reverence as holy,” distinct and set apart.<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-33">[33]</a></sup> But who treats God’s name as holy? God or God’s people? The aorist passive imperative ἁγιασθήτω at first suggests a punctiliar divine passive—God hallowing his own name at single future point in time. However, the regular use of aorist imperatives in prayers complicates the decision about timing.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-34">[34]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, regarding divine vs. human agency, there is OT evidence that points in both directions.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-35">[35]</a></sup></sup> As Nolland observes, “An eschatological orientation would connect with the thought of Ez. 36:23: ‘I [God] will sanctify my great name’. There the sanctification in view is exclusively an act of God.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-36">[36]</a></sup></sup> However, a non-eschatological reading can appeal to Isaiah 29:23, where Israel sanctifies God’s name, “and where, though God is clearly involved, it is people who are to honour God’s name in action and in praise.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-37">[37]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, as Luz notes, in Judaism “‘[h]allowing the name’ is a widespread expression that means obedience to God’s commandments. . . . For Jews its highest expression is martyrdom.”<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-38">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the brevity of the petition and the evidence available for both positions, a decision is difficult.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-39">[39]</a></sup></sup> However, I do not believe we have to make a choice.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-40">[40]</a></sup></sup> Rather, I interpret this petition as an “already-not-yet” request that both God and God’s people (including the one praying the prayer) would sanctify God’s name—God, by bringing his people back from exile, and God’s people, by doing God’s will in obedience to God’s commands.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-41">[41]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h2 id="your-kingdom-come-ἐλθέτω-ἡ-βασιλεία-σου-matt-610a-par-luke-112d">Your kingdom come (ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου; Matt. 6:10a; par. Luke 11:2d)</h2>
<p>Here I agree with Luz’s assessment that “[w]ith the second petition of the Lord’s Prayer . . . the eschatological interpretation of the prayer has its strongest pillar.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-42">[42]</a></sup></sup> On a purely grammatical level, it is hard to refute Weiss’ claim that, if the disciples of Jesus are told to pray that the kingdom would come, that means that the kingdom is not yet here.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-43">[43]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Your_kingdom_come"></a></p>
<p>However, this is only the case if the second petition is interpreted on its own. We cannot ignore all the evidence in the Gospels that portrays the kingdom as having, in some sense, already arrived. Furthermore, as I am arguing, the first and the third petitions help to interpret the second. Therefore, although the future, final arrival of God’s kingdom is primarily in view here (otherwise we would not be praying for its coming), human participation in the hallowing of God’s name and the doing of God’s will in the present means that they are, in some sense, bringing about the kingdom’s arrival already, even if God is surely given priority in agency.</p>
<h2 id="your-will-be-done-γενηθήτω-τὸ-θέλημά-σου-matt-610b">Your will be done (γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου; Matt. 6:10b)</h2>
<p>Regardless of one’s stance on the precise historical relationship between Matthew’s and Luke’s versions of the LP, I argue that, on the basis of accepting Matthew as canonical Scripture, Christian interpreters ought not ignore the third petition when interpreting the second. I agree with C. Clifton Black, who argues that, “[w]hile it is conceptually possible to separate petitions for the coming kingdom (Luke 11:2c = Matt. 6:10a) and the fulfillment of God’s will (Matt. 6:10b), that is theologically ill-advised,” because there is considerable conceptual overlap between kingdom and God’s will.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-44">[44]</a></sup></sup> Jesus’ words in Matthew 7:21 are important in this connection: “‘Not everyone who says to me, “Lord, Lord,” will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.’” After all, a kingdom is the realm in which the will of the king is carried out.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-45">[45]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>But, much like with the first petition, the question arises: who does God’s will? God? Or God’s people? An eschatological interpretation of this petition claims the former, and a non-eschatological the latter. The answer, again, is surely both. I agree with Luz that Matthew 6:33 (ζητεῖτε δὲ πρῶτον τὴν βασιλείαν [τοῦ θεοῦ] καὶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ) “offers a clue to Matthew’s understanding [of the third petition] in that the evangelist adds ‘righteousness’ to ‘God’s kingdom,’ much in the same way he puts the third petition alongside the second. Strive for the kingdom by doing the righteousness appropriate to it.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-46">[46]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Your_will_be_done"></a>We are also aided by Jesus’ verbatim repetition of γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου in 26:42. There, the sense of the prayer is that both Jesus and the Father might accomplish the Father’s will. Jesus is surely not praying that the Father would do whatever he wants to, without any corresponding implications for Jesus’ own actions. Here, I argue, the same noncompetitive relationship between divine and human agency is in view. The prayer is that both God himself and the person praying the prayer (and, most likely, other human beings as well) would accomplish God’s will.</p>
<h2 id="on-earth-as-it-is-in-heaven-ὡς-ἐν-οὐρανῷ-καὶ-ἐπὶ-γῆς-matt-610c">On earth as it is in heaven (ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς; Matt. 6:10c)</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, both “in heaven” (6:9b) and “on earth as it is in heaven” (6:10c) perhaps suggest the kind of dualistic/otherworldly thinking found in apocalyptic eschatology. However, just as I have argued that the first three petitions of the LP are mutually interpreting, I also argue that this clause should be taken to apply to all three petitions, and not merely to the third. It is perhaps better to translate the clause more literally than the NRSV: “as in heaven, [so] also on earth.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-47">[47]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-On_earth_as_it_is_in_heaven"></a>The clause seems to imply that God’s will is already done in heaven, and at least not yet fully done on earth. Given the conceptual overlap between (1) the hallowing of God’s name, (2) God’s kingdom/rule, and (3) the doing of God’s will, I argue that God’s name is hallowed and his kingdom/rule is already present and recognized in heaven, and at least not yet fully so on earth. This is the “not yet” aspect of both the clause in question and the first half of the LP. However, because humans participate in the hallowing of God’s name and the doing of God’s will on earth, there is also an “already” aspect to both this clause and the entire first half of the LP.</p>
<h2 id="give-us-this-day-our-daily-bread-τὸν-ἄρτον-ἡμῶν-τὸν-ἐπιούσιον-δὸς-ἡμῖν-σήμερον-matt-611-par-luke-113">Give us this day our daily bread (τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον δὸς ἡμῖν σήμερον; Matt. 6:11; par. Luke 11:3)</h2>
<p>So far, I have argued, against those who claim that either the entire LP or its first half are eschatological, that an “already-not-yet” perspective makes better sense of the first half of the prayer, especially given the noncompetitive relationship between human and divine agency that seems to be in view in the first, third, and (I argue) second petitions. That is, I have been pushing back against the apparent upper hand of the “not yet” position in the first half of the LP.</p>
<p>As we turn to the second half of the LP, however, the “already” position seems to have the upper hand. After all, what could be more mundane and quotidian than the request for daily bread? However, the fourth petition is not nearly as straightforward as its traditional English translation implies. The contested etymology and meaning of ἐπιούσιον has bearing on whether the bread petition of the LP is eschatological or not. Traditionally, the word has been translated as “daily,” which supports a non-eschatological interpretation. However, the word is so rare in Greek that interpreters since Origen have long suspected it is a neologism.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-48">[48]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>Depending on its etymology, ἐπιούσιον could mean (1) “necessary for existence,” (2) “for the current day, for today,” (3) “for the following day,” or (4) “coming,” in the sense of (a) “future,” (b) “coming/belonging to today”, (c) “next,” (d) “coming upon (us, from the Father),” or (e) “pertaining to the coming kingdom.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-49">[49]</a></sup></sup> A non-eschatological reading could rely on (1), (2), (3), (4b), (4c), or (4d). An eschatological reading could rely on (3), (4a), (4e), or a spiritualized interpretation of (1). Interpretation (3) seems to have the best lexical support, but this does not settle the eschatological question.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-50">[50]</a></sup></sup> “Give us this day our bread for the following day” could be “already,” referring to literal bread/sustenance for the immediate future, or “not yet,” referring to the coming messianic banquet.</p>
<p>On the one hand, even the staunchest advocates for the “not yet” interpretation of the fourth petition have to admit that literal, present bread is still in view. Consider Hagner, who, despite glossing the bread petition as “give to us today the eschatological bread that will be ours in the future,” admits that “[t]he prayer <em>is</em> nevertheless a prayer for bread. And there is a sense in which the bread (by synecdoche, ‘food’) we partake of daily is an anticipation of the eschatological banquet.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-51">[51]</a></sup></sup> On the other hand, given (1) the allusion here to the provision of manna in Exodus 16, (2) Jewish expectations of the return of manna in the final redemption,<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-52">[52]</a></sup></sup> and (3) the connections in the Gospels (esp. Luke) between Jesus’ table fellowship, the Last Supper, and the messianic banquet to come, the eschatological edge to this petition, even if indirect, should not be forgotten.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-53">[53]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-Give_us_this_day_our_daily_bre"></a>On balance, the evidence seems to favor an “already-not-yet” interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="and-forgive-us-our-debts-as-we-also-have-forgiven-our-debtors-καὶ-ἄφες-ἡμῖν-τὰ-ὀφειλήματα-ἡμῶν-ὡς-καὶ-ἡμεῖς-ἀφήκαμεν-τοῖς-ὀφειλέταις-ἡμῶν-matt-612-par-luke-114a">And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors (καὶ ἄφες ἡμῖν τὰ ὀφειλήματα ἡμῶν, ὡς καὶ ἡμεῖς ἀφήκαμεν τοῖς ὀφειλέταις ἡμῶν; Matt. 6:12; par. Luke 11:4a)</h2>
<p>Yet again, the question of agency arises. Who forgives debts/sins?<sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-54">[54]</a></sup> God or God’s people? However, whereas the first and third petitions were ambiguous, the fifth position is clear: both God and God’s people forgive. Without getting into the interesting questions about whether this petition implies that divine forgiveness is a <em>quid pro quo</em> for human forgiveness,<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-55">[55]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-And_forgive_us_our_debts_as_we"></a>I would merely like to note that the <em>reciprocity</em> of the forgiveness petition implies a noncompetitive view of divine and human agency. This noncompetitive agency—at least when it comes to the hallowing of God’s name, the doing of God’s will, and the forgiveness of debts—supports an “already-not-yet” interpretation of the LP and the kingdom of God. Although it does not settle the question of timing, it militates against the “not yet” view that, because we still await the final arrival of God’s kingdom, only God (and not human beings) participate in such an arrival. And, regarding the fifth petition specifically, the emphasis on the need for divine forgiveness of debts militates against the “already” view that the kingdom of God is an ethical ideal and the only salvation that is required is <em>epistemological</em>, the recognition that God is closer to us than we had previously thought.</p>
<h2 id="and-do-not-bring-us-to-the-time-of-trial-but-rescue-us-from-the-evil-one-καὶ-μὴ-εἰσενέγκῃς-ἡμᾶς-εἰς-πειρασμόν-ἀλλὰ-ῥῦσαι-ἡμᾶς-ἀπὸ-τοῦ-πονηροῦ-matt-613-par-luke-114b">And do not bring us to the time of trial, but rescue us from the evil one (καὶ μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν, ἀλλὰ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ; Matt. 6:13; par. Luke 11:4b)</h2>
<p>I argued above that the LP begins on an eschatological note with “our Father in heaven.” Does it end on an eschatological note as well? The answer depends upon just what πειρασμόν and τοῦ πονηροῦ mean. Although <em>peirasmos</em> has traditionally been translated as “temptation” (which in English connotes a temptation to sin or do wrong), the word in Greek can also mean testing or trial. The first thing that comes to mind is the <em>peirasmos</em> of Jesus himself in the wilderness, where perhaps both senses of the word are in play (Matt. 4:1–11). However, the question remains whether μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν has a specific, final temptation/trial in view (the “not yet” reading), or the many temptations/trials faced by disciples on a daily basis (the “already” reading).</p>
<p>While it is possible that, as Perrin argues, μὴ plus the aorist imperative εἰσενέγκῃς implies a specific πειρασμόν, even though it lacks the article, the common use of the aorist imperative in prayers (mentioned above with regard to ἁγιασθήτω in 6:9c) should perhaps prevent us from drawing strong conclusions here.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-56">[56]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, even if a specific πειρασμόν is in view, it is debatable whether or not this term had a technical apocalyptic/eschatological meaning.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-57">[57]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>When the phrase εἰς πειρασμόν occurs elsewhere in the Gospels, it is in Jesus’ injunction(s) in the Gethsemane to his disciples to stay awake and pray that they would not enter εἰς πειρασμόν (Matt. 26:41; Mark 14:38; Luke 22:40; 22:46). There, as here in the LP, the prayer seems to be for faithful perseverance in spite of temptation/trial, and not just for the complete absence of temptation/trial. Although Perrin is right to note the eschatological dimensions of the cosmic battle taking place at this point in the Gospel narratives, I think that France is also right to note that the immediate danger/testing was also in view, and not merely a final trial.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-58">[58]</a></sup></sup> An “already-not-yet” interpretation of the LP allows for an inaugurated eschatological perspective in which disciples encounter temptations/trials now that are foretastes/echoes of the final <em>peirasmos</em> to come.</p>
<p>As for the debate about whether τοῦ πονηροῦ refers to “evil” in general (neuter) or to “the evil one” (masculine), the evidence seems to slightly favor the latter interpretation. As France notes, Matthew’s use of the same term in 13:19 and 13:38 seems to clearly have “the evil one” in view. And the connection between πειρασμόν, and τοῦ πονηροῦ here seems to recall the temptation narrative in Matthew 4:1–11, where the devil is referred to as ὁ πειράζων (4:3).<sup><sup><a href="#post-41777-footnote-59">[59]</a></sup></sup> <a id="post-41777-And_do_not_bring_us_to_the_tim"></a>Therefore, it seems legitimate to equate τοῦ πονηροῦ with “the devil” with “the tempter.”</p>
<p>There is, therefore, a clearly eschatological aspect to both the LP’s opening address and its final petitions. However, once again, an “already-not-yet” inaugurated eschatological interpretation, and not a futurist one, makes the best sense of the LP’s ending.</p>
<h2 id="a-idpost-41777-conclusion_the_lords_prayers_aaconclusion-the-lps-answers-to-the-kingdom-questions"><a id="post-41777-Conclusion_The_Lords_Prayers_A"></a>Conclusion: The LP’s Answers to the “Kingdom Questions”</h2>
<p>While it has become common either to argue that the LP is entirely eschatological, or that the first half of the prayer is more eschatological and the second half is more ethical, I have argued that the “already-not-yet” view does the best job of explaining the entire LP, with elements of the “already” and the “not yet” throughout the prayer.</p>
<p>While “Our father in heaven” is, I admit, predominantly eschatological, it recalls the covenantal relationship—and the expectation of covenantal faithfulness—between God and God’s people. The first three petitions (“hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done”) are a mixture of the “already” and the “not yet.” Because both God and humans hallow God’s name and do God’s will, I argue that they both bring about the kingdom’s arrival in the present, even if God is surely given the priority in agency and the full arrival of the kingdom is still future. The fifth petition (“forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors”) makes the reciprocal, noncompetitive relationship explicit. Yet it also militates against collapsing the kingdom of God into a mere ethical ideal. The fourth (“give us this day our ἐπιούσιον bread”) and final petitions (“do not bring us to πειρασμόν, but rescue us from τοῦ πονηροῦ”) are also a mixture of the “already” and the “not yet,” although they clearly acknowledge that human beings need divine provision and protection in order to cooperate with God in the doing of his will.</p>
<p>Both God and God’s people hallow God’s name, do God’s will, forgive debts, and bring about God’s kingdom—even as God is given the clear priority in each of those actions. Put simply, God initiates the kingdom, but his people participate in it. To the degree that we lose sight of the fact that God, not humans, is the primary agent of the kingdom, we forget that it is <em>God’s</em> kingdom we are praying about in the second petition and the LP. However, to the extent that we ignore how we are called to participate in the kingdom even as we pray for its full arrival, we forget that it is God’s <em>kingdom</em>—and every kingdom has its subjects. According to the LP, the kingdom of God is eschatological, but not otherworldly. It has ethical implications, but it is not a non-eschatological ethical ideal.</p>

For example, Black summarizes Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz’s (<em>The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide</em> [trans.

<p>Of course, for Weiss and many of his theological descendants, this describes Jesus’ mistaken view of the kingdom of God.

<li>
<p>The question of the precise relationship between the two versions of the LP in the Gospels (Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4) has long occupied biblical scholars. For a sense of the debate, see Betz, <em>The Sermon on the Mount</em> (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995), 370–86; Black, <em>The Lord’s Prayer</em>, 43–49; Luz, <em>Matthew 1–7</em>, 309–11. Without discounting the importance of this question, I will focus on the Matthean version of the LP in this paper, mainly because Matthew’s version is closer to the versions commonly prayed by Christians today. Nevertheless, Luke’s version of the LP, read within the context of Luke’s Gospel, also seems to support (1) a noncompetitive view of divine and human agency and, therefore, (2) the “already-not-yet” view of the kingdom of God. I will comment upon Luke’s version as necessary. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-15">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am merely trying to argue that, when it comes to these actions, the question of agency is not a zero-sum game. Just because God hallows his name, brings his kingdom, does his will, and forgives debts, that does not mean that human beings do not do so as well. This is therefore much less ambitious than the account of “non-competitive relations” between Creator and creatures in Kathryn Tanner, <em>Jesus, Humanity, and the Trinity: A Brief Systematic Theology</em> (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 2001), although I think that Tanner is on the right track. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-16">↑</a></p>

<p>Here I agree with N.T.

<p>This is <em>contra</em> Milling, who claims that only an eschatological reading of the entire LP secures the unity of the prayer. He characterizes other, non-eschatological readings as “sacrific[ing] the unity of the Prayer, in an attempt to make a few individual clauses relevant and practical<a id="post-41777-The_Unity_of_the_Lords_Prayer"></a>” (“The Interpretation of the Lord’s Prayer in Terms of Future Eschatology,” 13). But I think this is an example of the pot calling the kettle black. Both the “already” and the “not yet” readings have to work hard to explain (away) at least a few lines of the LP in order to arrive at either a thoroughgoing ethical or eschatological interpretation. The “already-not-yet” position, however, is able to allow both elements of the LP to stand in unity-in-tension. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-24">↑</a></p>

<p>Perrin, <em>The Kingdom of God</em>, 224–26. Perrin also argues that, “in encouraging his disciples to call on God as ‘Father,’ Jesus is implying the restoration of the Adamic image.” Perrin previously argues that “[t]he homology shared by Adam and the creator God inevitably implies some kind of filial relationship (sonship), as becomes clear when Adam has a son ‘in his own likeness’ (Gen 5:3)” (43). However, I am more hesitant to make this connection, because I think there is a difference, revealed in the use of Hebrew prepositions, between Adam being created “in our <em>image</em>, according to our <em>likeness</em>” (בְּצַלְמֵ֖נוּ כִּדְמוּתֵ֑נוּ; Gen. 1:26) and Seth being “in [Adam’s] <em>likeness</em>, according to his <em>image</em>” (בִּדְמוּתֹ֖ו כְּצַלְמֹ֑ו; Gen. 5:3). See David J.A. Clines, “The Image of God in Man,” <em>Tyndale Bulletin</em> 19 (1968): 53–103, at 78. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-30">↑</a></p>

<p>Lohmeyer and Perrin suggest that there is an implied critique of the temple here, God having withdrawn his presence from Jerusalem. Ernst Lohmeyer, <em>The Lord’s Prayer</em> (London: Collins, 1965), 60–61; Perrin, <em>The Kingdom of God</em>, 227. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-31">↑</a></p>

<p>Luz lists Lev. 10:3; Ezek. 36:22–23; 38:23; and 39:7 as texts where God hallows his own name, and Exod. 20:7; Lev. 22:32; and Isa. 29:23 as texts where humans hallow God’s name. <em>Matthew 1–7</em>, 317. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-35">↑</a></p>

<li>
<p>Nolland, <em>Matthew</em>, 286–87. Nolland also cites similarities between the LP and the Jewish Qaddish/Kaddish prayer as evidence in favor of a non-eschatological reading. However, I am not so sure that the Qaddish’s “May he establish his kingdom in your lifetime” is non-eschatological. Much like the petition of the LP in question here, it appears ambiguous. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-37">↑</a></p>

<p>I agree with Luz’s assessment that “[o]nly for an exclusively eschatological interpretation of the petition are there no arguments.” <em>Matthew 1–7</em>, 318. <a href="#post-41777-footnote-ref-40">↑</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Perrin notes, the context of Ezek. 36 and Isa. 29 seems to demand such a “return from exile” interpretation. However, although he does briefly note that Ezek. 36 speaks of the people’s renewed obedience to the covenant, I think that the connection between divine and human agency in this petition of the LP deserves more emphasis than he gives it.

It seems like an important exception(!), though not definitive.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It just happened again. I had to consult &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/3878/a-greek-english-lexicon-of-the-new-testament-and-other-early-christian-literature-3rd-ed&#34;&gt;“BDAG,” A Greek–English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (3rd ed.)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t own a copy, so every time I have to consult BDAG I think “I really should buy this.” But for the past decade or so, primarily because of BDAG’s cost ($150 on Logos, $130 used on Amazon, $165 new on Amazon) I’ve held off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I’m seeking to build my “must-have” personal reference library to sustain a ministry as a pastor theologian. So, I think I need to buy BDAG sometime soon. While I’m at it, I might as well get HALOT, the Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament… &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/5228/bdag-halot-bundle&#34;&gt;Logos sells them as a bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Might as well get the <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/37742/the-ivp-bible-dictionary-series">IVP Bible Dictionaries</a>, too. I own hard copies of Prophets and Jesus and the Gospels, but I could use NT Background, Paul and His Letters, Historical Books, Pentateuch, and Wisdom, Poetry and Writings…</p>
<p>How far does the list of “must-have” reference works go?</p>
<p>I’m currently a Ph.D. student in theology, but my project is integrative across the biblical-theological studies divide (Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible). So, I need to have both my Bible and my theology bases covered, both now as a Ph.D. student and in the future as a “pastor theologian.”</p>
<p>What reference works in biblical and theological studies are your “must-owns”?</p>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know at least this: Instagram won’t save us, and tweeted verse will not undo what we’ve done to ourselves. But neither is there any special enchantment to reading in print. So this is not the Luddite’s redoubt, nostalgically canonizing codex or canvas as if history had come to an end in some glorious past. Every medium now reaches us inside the ecology of attention masterminded by Silicon Valley. We take pictures of our books and coffee, for heaven’s sake. The point isn’t platform but desire: what do we want when we pick up our phones? We don’t need better media, or to romanticize old media. We need to change what we want.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;John Webster’s essay, “Reading the Bible: The Example of Barth and Bonhoeffer” (pages 87–110 in &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2EJ4SVN&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word and Church: Essays in Christian Dogmatics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [Edinburgh; New York: T&amp;amp;T Clark, 2001]) is, in large part, the inspiration for &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/&#34;&gt;my doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Bonhoeffer nor Barth were &lt;em&gt;wissenschaftlich&lt;/em&gt; theologians; both were practical or pastoral theologians of the church of Jesus Christ. . . . Both, in short, were members of the guild, so despised by Kant and most of his heirs, of biblical theologians. Pondering their work may give us cause to reflect on three matters (108–109).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Webster’s essay, “Reading the Bible: The Example of Barth and Bonhoeffer” (pages 87–110 in <a href="https://amzn.to/2EJ4SVN"><em>Word and Church: Essays in Christian Dogmatics</em></a> [Edinburgh; New York: T&amp;T Clark, 2001]) is, in large part, the inspiration for <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">my doctoral dissertation</a>.</p>
<p>I’d like to share the three reflections/lessons Webster draws from the biblical work of Barth and Bonhoeffer.</p>
<p>Wrapping up his essay, Webster claims that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither Bonhoeffer nor Barth were <em>wissenschaftlich</em> theologians; both were practical or pastoral theologians of the church of Jesus Christ. . . . Both, in short, were members of the guild, so despised by Kant and most of his heirs, of biblical theologians. Pondering their work may give us cause to reflect on three matters (108–109).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the first two “matters.”</p>
<ol>
<li>“[H]ermeneutical and methodological questions are at best of secondary importance in the interpretation of Scripture. The real business is elsewhere, and it is spiritual, and therefore dogmatic” (109).</li>
<li>“[I]t is therefore true that a fittingly Christian hermeneutics ‘requires the formation and transformation of the character appropriate to Christian disciples’. But Bonhoeffer and Barth counsel real caution here. . . . However little it may apply to Bonhoeffer, Barth’s worry about any ‘cultivation’ of habits of reading—that it may substitute routine for repentance—ought not to go unheeded” (109–110).</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll quote the third matter/lesson at length, because it is so good!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third: the chief task of Christian theology is exegesis. The reason for that is devastatingly simple: ‘Jesus Christ as he is attested to us in Holy Scripture is the one Word of God.’ Theology is exegesis because its matter is Jesus Christ as he communicates himself through Holy Scripture. And so attention to Holy Scripture is not only a necessary but also—in a real sense—a sufficient condition for theology, because Scripture itself is not only necessary but also sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Webster continues with a brilliant way of charting the recent history of theology vis-a-vis the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way of writing the history of modern theology would be to trace the sad fate of Scripture’s sufficiency and its reduction to merely necessary status. The counter to this is: exegesis, exegesis and exegesis. The task of exegesis is far too important to be devolved upon biblical technicians. But if modern theology demonstrates a failure on this score, it does not lie primarily on the part of the guild of biblical scholars, but on the part of dogmatic theologians, who have all too often abdicated responsibility for exegesis, and rested content with genres and modes of argument which have encouraged the conceptual takeover of the biblical gospel. Christian theology is properly evangelical, because it is generated by the gospel. But part of securing that evangelical character will be recovering a rhetoric for theology which simply lets Scripture be. Work on that task—which, in their different ways, Barth and Bonhoeffer also deemed theology’s central preoccupation—is scarcely begun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, theologians, let’s get to work on “recovering a rhetoric for theology which simply lets Scripture be”!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m reading Walter Sinnott-Armstrong’s excellent book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2BNTlTq&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think Again: How to Reason and Argue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it (on pages 25–26), I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules&#34;&gt;“Rapoport’s Rules.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First formulated by mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport and discussed by Daniel Dennett (&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2NmrH4m&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 31–35), here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>How would our conversations—everything from family dinner to classroom discussions to church business meetings—look different if we put these rules into practice?</p>

      <title>There&#39;s more than one kind of &#34;priesthood&#34; in the New Testament</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/nbfr.12440&#34;&gt;this article in New Blackfriars&lt;/a&gt;, and it looks helpful, especially in the context of Anglican debates about women’s ordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author: Geoffrey Turner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”</p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey Turner</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="types-of-priesthood-in-the-new-testament">Types of Priesthood in the New Testament</h2>
<ol>
<li>Aaronic, sacrificing priest (like Zechariah, Luke 1:5)</li>
<li>The risen Christ</li>
<li>Priesthood of all believers</li>
<li>Ordained presbyters/elders</li>
<li>Passing mention of pagan priests (Acts 14:13)</li>
</ol>
<p>Concluding paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point of this paper, however, is not to try to change our naming of the ordained; our practice has centuries of tradition behind it. The purpose is to ensure that we do not muddle these distinctive types of priesthood. And the recent practice of calling our ordained priests ‘ministerial priests’ is a recognition that their priesthood is distinct from that of Jesus Christ and distinct from that of the baptised. There is no basis in the NT for supposing that that presbyters share the high priesthood of Christ as it is described in Hebrews. On the contrary, that high priesthood has only two members: Melchizedek and Jesus, and only one of those is a historical person. Deciding who may become a presbyter/ministerial priest and on what basis must be decided on its own terms and not by merging it with some other form of priesthood. Muddling these is particularly unhelpful when discussing whether women can be ordained as presbyters/ministerial priests.</p>

      <title>Women&#39;s Ordination Debates in Anglicanism: The 2017 ACNA Report and the 2003 AMIA Report</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/womens-ordination-debates-in-anglicanism-the-2017-acna-report-and-the-2003-amia-report/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I became an “egalitarian” in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women’s ordination debate within Anglicanism. Growing up, the debate was all about particular Bible verses and whether or not women could teach and preach. However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I became an “egalitarian” in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.</p>
<p>It’s taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women’s ordination debate within Anglicanism. Growing up, the debate was all about particular Bible verses and whether or not women could teach and preach. However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.</p>
<p>Over at Anglican Pastor, where I’m the Managing Editor, we recently published a three-part interview with Rev. Tish Harrison Warren, who is a priest in the Anglican Church in North America [ACNA].</p>
<p>In <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/ask-an-anglican-pastor-an-interview-with-tish-harrison-warren-pt-2/">part 2 of the interview</a>, Tish answers some questions about women’s ordination.</p>
<p>This prompted some negative reactions from some of our readers, and it’s caused me to revisit <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/want-to-learn-more-about-womens-ordination-debates-within-anglicanism-start-with-these-resources/">the 2017 ACNA Holy Orders Task Force Report</a> as a starting point for coming to grips with the specifically <em>Anglican</em> debates about women’s ordination.</p>
<p>I still think that <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HolyOrdersTaskForce.pdf">the ACNA Report</a> is a fine starting point for this purpose. However, I’m disappointed that, in the “Evangelical” portion of Section 4: Arguments For and Against, the ACNA Report relies heavily upon <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AMIA_2003_Womens-Ordination-Report.pdf">this 2003 Anglican Mission in America [AMIA] Report</a>—so much so, in fact, that the ACNA Report simply quotes at length from the AMIA Report when it comes to the exegesis of specific biblical texts.</p>
<p>(See pages 269–74 of the ACNA Report and pages 37–105 of the AMIA Report to see what I mean.)</p>
<p>Nothing against the careful work shown in the 2003 AMIA Report, but it’s odd to me that the ACNA Report relies so heavily on a document that it categorizes underneath the “Books not in favor of women’s ordination” section in its Bibliography for Further Study. (See pages 303–305 of the ACNA Report.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the ACNA Report’s conclusion that “The result is a ‘text jam.&rsquo;” is perfectly justified, but I would have liked to see a little bit more direct exegetical work in this section of the ACNA document!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, are coming to Anglicanism from a different tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, then one thing you should know is that Anglican debates about women’s ordination can often be quite different from debates about the same topic in other church contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is due to Anglicans having different views on, among other things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sacraments, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ordination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in my broadly evangelical/non-denominational/Baptist upbringing, debates about women in ministry centered on whether or not women were allowed to preach and teach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This is due to Anglicans having different views on, among other things:</p>

<p>In Anglican circles, although you can still find debates about preaching/teaching, I’ve found that people place much more focus on whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the contours of Anglican debates on women’s ordination, I recommend that you start out by reading the <strong>2017 ACNA Holy Orders Task Force Report</strong>. It is an especially useful document for those coming from a USA evangelical background into Anglicanism.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-acna-holy-orders-task-force-report-2017">The ACNA Holy Orders Task Force Report (2017)</h2>
<p><em>Here’s an excerpt from <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net/?/main/page/1448">the official ACNA announcement of the report</a>, quoted from the ACNA website.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2012 the College of Bishops appointed a Task Force on Holy Orders to provide the College with a scholarly and informed study on Holy Orders and, specifically, women in Holy Orders (the enabling resolution is reprinted in what follows). The Task Force, led by Bishop David Hicks, consisted of people representing differing perspectives and practices. They have met for the past 5 years and during that time have periodically released progress reports. This past January Bishop Hicks presented a report on the last phase of the process to the College, and we are now releasing the whole report to the Province.</p>

<p>I <em>highly</em> recommend that you at least <strong>take the time to read Section 5, because it includes a final summary of the task force’s findings, including their recommendations to the College of Bishops</strong>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the College of Bishops issued a statement on the ordination of women on September 7, 2017.</p>
<h2 id="a-statement-from-the-acna-college-of-bishops-on-the-ordination-of-women">A Statement from the ACNA College of Bishops on the Ordination of Women</h2>
<p><em>Click <a href="http://www.anglicanchurch.net/?/main/page/1519">here</a> to see the original version of this on the ACNA website, which includes an introduction from Archbishop Foley Beach.</em></p>
<p>In the preamble to the statement, the Bishops say the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an act of mutual submission at the foundation of the Anglican Church in North America, it was agreed that each Diocese and Jurisdiction has the freedom, responsibility, and authority to study Holy Scripture and the Apostolic Tradition of the Church, and to seek the mind of Christ in determining its own convictions and practices concerning the ordination of women to the diaconate and the priesthood. It was also unanimously agreed that women will not be consecrated as bishops in the Anglican Church in North America. These positions are established within our Constitution and Canons and, because we are a conciliar Church, would require the action of both Provincial Council and Provincial Assembly to be changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, they proceed to the statement itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having gratefully received and thoroughly considered the five-year study by the Theological Task Force on Holy Orders, we acknowledge that there are differing principles of ecclesiology and hermeneutics that are acceptable within Anglicanism that may lead to divergent conclusions regarding women’s ordination to the priesthood. However, we also acknowledge that this practice is a recent innovation to Apostolic Tradition and Catholic Order. We agree that there is insufficient scriptural warrant to accept women’s ordination to the priesthood as standard practice throughout the Province. However, we continue to acknowledge that individual dioceses have constitutional authority to ordain women to the priesthood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the Bishops state their commitments moving forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a College of Bishops, we confess that our Province has failed to affirm adequately the ministry of all Christians as the basic agents of the work of the Gospel. We have not effectively discipled and equipped all Christians, male and especially female, lay and ordained, to fulfill their callings and ministries in the work of God’s kingdom. We repent of this and commit to work earnestly toward a far greater release of the whole Church to her God-given mission.</p>
<p>Having met in Conclave to pray, worship, study, talk, and listen well to one another, we commit to move forward in unity to carry on the good witness and work that God has given us to do in North America (Ephesians 4:1-6; John 17). We invite and urge all members of the Province to engage with us in this endeavor to grow in understanding the mission and ministry of all God’s people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement was adopted unanimously by the ACNA College of Bishops in September 2017. It describes the current state of the issue in the ACNA.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-acnas-position-on-womens-ordination">What’s The ACNA’s Position on Women’s Ordination?</h2>
<p>This question is included on the <a href="http://www.anglicanchurch.net/index.php/main/faq/">ACNA’s FAQ page</a>. Here’s the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the inception of the Anglican Church in North America, the lead Bishops unanimously agreed to work together for the good of the Kingdom. As part of this consensus, it was understood that there were differing understandings regarding the ordination of women to Holy Orders, but there existed a mutual love and respect for one another and a desire to move forward for the good of the Church. This commitment was deeply embedded in the Constitution and Canons overwhelmingly adopted by the Inaugural Assembly (2009).</p>
<p>In respect of the two integrities concerning Holy Orders, three matters were specifically agreed in Constitution and Canons:</p>
<p>(1) The Province shall make no canon abridging the authority of any member dioceses, clusters or networks (whether regional or affinity-based) and those dioceses banded together as jurisdictions with respect to its practice regarding the ordination of women to the diaconate or presbyterate (Constitution, Article VIII)<br>
(2) Except as hereinafter provided, the norms for ordination shall be determined by the Bishops having jurisdiction. (Title III Canon 1.4)<br>
(3) To be a suitable candidate for the episcopate (bishop), a person must: Be a male Presbyter at least 35 years old. (Title III Canon 8.3.7)</p>

      <title>Barth, the Bible, and &#34;What we ought to do&#34;</title>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-the-bible-and-what-we-ought-to-do/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Came across this Barth quote in Church Dogmatics II/2 this morning. I really like it, because it’s a good reminder that Barth valued the Bible. His distinction between the Bible as witness to the Word of God and Jesus Christ as the Word of God did not cause him to abandon the Scriptural witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is as well to remind ourselves, at the conclusion of this analysis, that the question: What ought we to do?, is the question which was put to Peter and the other apostles (Ac. 2:37f.) by those who heard Peter’s sermon on the day of Pentecost. This means that, although we ourselves have to ask it, we must not ask it of ourselves. We must ask it of God, of the God who has revealed Himself to us and has given us the witnesses of His revelation. It is a question which is put by Holy Scripture, and therefore we must put it to Holy Scripture as the witness to God’s revelation. That the sovereign decision of God confronts us and our decisions objectively in Jesus Christ is, as we have seen, the supreme criterion of all ethical reflection. &lt;strong&gt;But Jesus Christ cannot be separated from His apostles, from the whole witness which underlies the community of God in the form of Israel, and then of the Christian Church. We hear Him as we hear His witnesses.&lt;/strong&gt; It is in their testimony that the divine command is always to be sought and will always be found as the sovereign divine decision. We must not be surprised, then, if—in very different forms—we are always given what is in fact the one answer: “Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>*I’ve marked volumes unavailable in the DKBL with an asterisk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tvz-verlag.ch/reihe/karl-barth-gesamtausgabe-10/?page_id=1">According to the publisher, TVZ</a>:</p>

<p>Angelegt ist die Gesamtausgabe auf ca. 70 Bände. Nicht aufgenommen wird die «Kirchliche Dogmatik» und – ausser den bereits edierten Texten – die gut greifbar vorliegenden monographischen Arbeiten Barths. Die Gesamtausgabe gliedert sich in sechs Abteilungen:<br>
I. Predigten,<br>
II. Akademische Werke,<br>
III. Vorträge und kleinere Arbeiten,<br>
IV. Gespräche,<br>
V. Briefe,<br>
VI. Aus Karl Barths Leben.</p>
<p>Jedem Text bzw. jedem Band sind Einleitungen vorangestellt, in denen der Anlass und die Entstehung des Textes, der historische oder biografische Hintergrund und, soweit ermittelbar, die unmittelbare Wirkungsgeschichte erläutert werden. Textgrundlage ist in der Regel der letzte von Barth autorisierte Druck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1971 more than 50 volumes of the Karl Barth Complete Edition have been published by Theologische Verlag Zürich. In it, Barth’s texts are critically edited and presented in such a way that they become readable and accessible for scientific work as well as for a wider audience. Each volume is edited by one or more specialized publishers and appears in collaboration with the management of the Karl Barth Archive.</p>
<p>The complete edition is laid out at about 70 volumes. Not included is the “Church Dogmatics” and – apart from the already edited texts – Barth’s readily available monographic works. The complete edition is divided into six sections:<br>
I. Sermons,<br>
II. Academic Works,<br>
III. Lectures and minor works,<br>
IV. Conversations (Talks/Discussions),<br>
V. Letters,<br>
VI. From Karl Barth’s life.</p>
<p>Each text or volume is preceded by introductions, in which the cause and the origin of the text, the historical or biographical background and, to the extent that can be determined, the immediate impact story are explained. The textual basis is usually the last print authorized by Barth.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To make this list, I’ve used the data available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dkbl.alexanderstreet.com/&#34;&gt;Digital Karl Barth Library&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve just taken the tables of contents in the sermon volumes of Barth’s collected works and put them all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to display the dates correctly in Markdown is to write these up as code blocks, as I’ve done below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spirit, Flesh, Restoration, and Sublimation</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/spirit-flesh-restoration-and-sublimation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 18:25:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/spirit-flesh-restoration-and-sublimation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an intriguing passage in Bonhoeffer’s Letters and Papers from Prison where he discusses the relationship between “spirit” and “flesh,” in the context of discussing “restoration” and “sublimation,” in the context of discussing lyrics from certain hymns and songs that were meaningful to him in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is, from a December 19, 1943 (the Fourth Sunday of Advent) letter to Eberhard Bethge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks this line has been running through my head over and over: “Calm your hearts, dear friends; / whatever plagues you, / whatever fails you, / I will restore it all.” What does that mean, “I will restore it all”? Nothing is lost; in Christ all things are taken up, preserved, albeit in transfigured form, transparent, clear, liberated from the torment of self-serving demands. Christ brings all this back, indeed, as God intended, without being distorted by sin. The doctrine originating in Eph. 1:10 of the restoration of all things, ἀνακεφαλαίωσις—re-capitulatio (Irenaeus), is a magnificent and consummately consoling thought. (DBWE 8:229–30)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Here it is, from a December 19, 1943 (the Fourth Sunday of Advent) letter to Eberhard Bethge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks this line has been running through my head over and over: “Calm your hearts, dear friends; / whatever plagues you, / whatever fails you, / I will restore it all.” What does that mean, “I will restore it all”? Nothing is lost; in Christ all things are taken up, preserved, albeit in transfigured form, transparent, clear, liberated from the torment of self-serving demands. Christ brings all this back, indeed, as God intended, without being distorted by sin. The doctrine originating in Eph. 1:10 of the restoration of all things, ἀνακεφαλαίωσις—re-capitulatio (Irenaeus), is a magnificent and consummately consoling thought. (DBWE 8:229–30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also occasionally think of the p 231 from the Augustinian “O bone Jesu,” by Schütz. In a certain way, namely, in its devotion—ecstatic, aching, and nevertheless so pure—isn’t this passage something like the “restoration” of all earthly desire? By the way, “restoration” is, of course, not to be confused with “sublimation”! “Sublimation” is σάρξ, (and pietistic?!), whereas “restoration” is spirit, meant not in the sense of “spiritualization” (which is also σάρξ) but of καινή κτίσις through the πνεῦμα ἅγιον. (DBWE 8:230–31)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s intriguing (to me) because, in other prison letters, Bonhoeffer uses “spirit” and/vs. “flesh,” as well as the word “restoration,” to describe Barth’s theological critique of religion.</p>
<p>On April 30, 1944, Bonhoeffer wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can Christ become Lord of the religionless as well? Is there such a thing as a religionless Christian? If religion is only the garb in which Christianity is clothed—and this garb has looked very different in different ages—what then is religionless Christianity? Barth, who is the only one to have begun thinking along these lines, nevertheless did not pursue these thoughts all the way, did not think them through, but <strong>ended up with a positivism of revelation, which in the end essentially remained a restoration.</strong> (DBWE 8:363–64, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, on June 8, 1944, Bonhoeffer wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barth was the first to recognize the error of all these attempts (which were basically all still sailing in the wake of liberal theology, without intending to do so) in that they all aim to save some room for religion in the world or over against the world. <strong>He led the God of Jesus Christ forward to battle against religion, πνεῦμα against σάρξ.</strong> This remains his greatest merit (the second edition of The Epistle to the Romans, despite all the neo-Kantian eggshells!). Through his later Dogmatics he has put the church in a position to carry this distinction in principle all the way through. (DBWE 8:428–29, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Furthermore</em>, “sublimation” is a very important word for Barth’s theological critique of religion as found in Church Dogmatics I/2, §17, “The Revelation of God as the Sublimation [Aufhebung, sometimes translated “abolition”] of Religion”!</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought I might be on to something here. What was going on with Bonhoeffer’s collocation of “flesh,” “spirit,” “restoration,” and “sublimation”?</p>
<p>However, I took a closer look and realized that, in the December 19, 1943 letter, Bonhoeffer uses the word <em>Wiederbringung</em> for “restoration,” as opposed to <em>Restauration</em>, which he uses to describe Barth’s positivism of revelation in the April 30, 1944 letter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he uses <em>Sublimierung</em> for “sublimation,” and not <em>Aufhebung</em>, the term Barth uses in CD I/2.</p>
<p>So now I’m trying to parse out the differences between “Wiederbringung” and “Restauration,” and between “Sublimierung” and “Aufhebung.” Not to mention the connection between Barth and Bonhoeffer on the theme of spirit vs. flesh!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, the scale read 192.4. I’d really like it to read 180 or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in lieu of how effective &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/&#34;&gt;putting money on the line via StickK&lt;/a&gt; has been for my daily writing habit these past two weeks, I’ve decided to put money on the line as motivation to stick to the Slow Carb Diet for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my writing habit, I’ve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 goes to the NRA. (I’m a pacifist. I do not like the NRA.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>For my Slow Carb Diet commitment, I’m going to keep the diet 6 days a week for 4 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 will go to NARAL Pro Choice America. (I’m pro-life. I think abortion is a tragedy.)</p>
<h2 id="try-stickk">Try StickK</h2>
<p>If there’s a habit that you’d like to develop or quit, I highly recommend giving <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/">StickK</a> a try! Fear of losing money to an organization you hate is a powerful motivator!</p>

<p>And if you’d like to lose fat/weight, I highly recommend the <a href="https://medium.com/@erinfrey/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slow-carb-diet-a67062761d92">Slow Carb Diet</a>.</p>
<p>It’s built around 5 simple rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule #1: Avoid “white” starchy carbohydrates (or those that can be white). This means all bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and grains. If you have to ask, don’t eat it.</p>
<p>Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. You already do this; you’re just picking new default meals.</p>
<p>Rule #3: Don’t drink calories. Exception: 1-2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed.</p>
<p>Rule #4: Don’t eat fruit. (Fructose –&gt; glycerol phosphate –&gt; more bodyfat, more or less.) Avocado and tomatoes are excepted.</p>
<p>Rule #5: Take one day off per week and go nuts. I choose and recommend Saturday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/4hourbodyslowcarb/">pretty active sub-Reddit devoted to the Slow Carb Diet</a> if you’d like more information.</p>

      <title>Barth and Bonhoeffer on Religion&#39;s False God(s)</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-and-bonhoeffer-on-religions-false-gods/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2019 19:08:38 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Epistle to the Romans&lt;/em&gt;, Barth writes the following concerning the false image of God at the heart of religion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What men on this side resurrection name ‘God’ is most characteristically not God. Their ‘God’ does not redeem his creation, but allows free course to the unrighteousness of men; does not declare himself to be God, but is the complete affirmation of the course of the world and of men as it is. This is intolerable, for, in spite of the highest honours we offer him for his adornment, he is, in fact, ‘No-God’. The cry of revolt against such a god is nearer the truth than is the sophistry with which men attempt to justify him (&lt;em&gt;Romans&lt;/em&gt;, 40).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <em>The Epistle to the Romans</em>, Barth writes the following concerning the false image of God at the heart of religion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What men on this side resurrection name ‘God’ is most characteristically not God. Their ‘God’ does not redeem his creation, but allows free course to the unrighteousness of men; does not declare himself to be God, but is the complete affirmation of the course of the world and of men as it is. This is intolerable, for, in spite of the highest honours we offer him for his adornment, he is, in fact, ‘No-God’. The cry of revolt against such a god is nearer the truth than is the sophistry with which men attempt to justify him (<em>Romans</em>, 40).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, for Barth, the quicker the enterprise of worshipping the “No-God” runs aground, the better, for only after we have been disabused of our false god will we be ready to encounter the true God.</p>
<p>This is similar to Bonhoeffer, who, writing to Bethge on July 16, 1944, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the crucial distinction between Christianity and all religions. Human religiosity directs people in need to the power of God in the world, God as deus ex machina. The Bible directs people toward the powerlessness and the suffering of God; only the suffering God can help. To this extent, one may say that the previously described development toward the world’s coming of age, which has cleared the way by eliminating a false notion of God, frees us to see the God of the p 480 Bible, who gains ground and power in the world by being powerless (<em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em>, DBWE 8:479-480).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Barth and Bonhoeffer thought that the elimination of a false notion of God was a good thing, even if it did not appear to be a good thing, because such an elimination was a preparation to encounter the true God.</p>
<p>However, Barth and Bonhoeffer differed in their descriptions of the false gods that humans are prone to create and worship.</p>
<p>For Barth in <em>Romans</em>, the ‘No-God’ is revealed to be a false god because he merely affirms the course of world history and the unrighteous desires of human beings, without judgment and without redemption.</p>
<p>However, for Bonhoeffer in <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em>, the false god is revealed to be false because he is a god of power/strength, the projected opposite of human weakness, whereas the God of the Bible is a God who (1) can affirm human strength and (2) redeems through weakness and suffering, as seen in the life of Jesus.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for Barth the “No-God” is able to be known directly, he is close at hand, whereas the true God is hidden even in the midst of his self-revelation, never able to be known or grasped directly. (See, e.g., <em>Romans</em>, 38, 51.)</p>
<p>However, for Bonhoeffer, even early in his career, “God is present, that is, not in eternal nonobjectivity but—to put it quite provisionally for now—‘haveable’ [,habbar‘], graspable in the Word within the church” (<em>Act and Being</em>, DBWE 2:91).</p>
<p>In <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em>, it is the false God that is distant, encountering human beings only at the border [Grenze] of their possibilities. The true God, for Bonhoeffer, always encounters human beings in the center [Mitte] of their lives.</p>

      <title>Karl Barth&#39;s Reversal on the &#34;Knowledge of Good and Evil&#34;</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/karl-barths-reversal-on-the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2019 19:07:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/karl-barths-reversal-on-the-knowledge-of-good-and-evil/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I argue that, although Barth’s interpretation of the Genesis passages changed between &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2SVxH69&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Epistle to the Romans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/5758/barths-church-dogmatics&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Church Dogmatics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his mature readings of Genesis 2–3 still support his overall theological critique of religion as idolatry, the self-justifying positing of false gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, in &lt;em&gt;Romans&lt;/em&gt; (240–57, esp. 246–51), Barth interpreted “the knowledge of good and evil” as the divine secret that humans are merely humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby concealed the creator/creature distinction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and was meant to enable a direct relationship between God and humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, human disobedience revealed the distinction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and led to the rise of religion as worship of God, an independent action over against their creator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Church Dogmatics&lt;/em&gt; (esp. CD III/1, 257–76, but also IV/1, 418–78), Barth interpreted the knowledge of good and evil as God’s prerogative to judge between what ought to be and what ought not to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I argue that, although Barth’s interpretation of the Genesis passages changed between <a href="https://amzn.to/2SVxH69"><em>The Epistle to the Romans</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/5758/barths-church-dogmatics"><em>Church Dogmatics</em></a>, his mature readings of Genesis 2–3 still support his overall theological critique of religion as idolatry, the self-justifying positing of false gods.</p>
<p>Specifically, in <em>Romans</em> (240–57, esp. 246–51), Barth interpreted “the knowledge of good and evil” as the divine secret that humans are merely humans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wolf Krötke, acclaimed as a foremost interpreter of the theologies of Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, demonstrates the continuing significance of these two theologians for Christian faith and life. This book enables readers to look with fresh eyes at the theologies of Barth and Bonhoeffer and offers new insights for reading the history of modern theology. It also helps churches see how they can be creative minorities in societies that have forgotten God.</p>
<p>Translated by a senior American scholar of Christian theology and an accomplished translator, this is the first major translation of Krötke’s work in the English language. The book is necessary reading for those studying Barth, Bonhoeffer, and other developments in modern German dogmatics.</p>

      <title>A Prayer of Confession</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To start off the semester the other day, we prayed this prayer of confession together as a class. The professor didn’t remember where the prayer was from, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/a-corporate-confession-of-faith-based-on-the-ten-commandments-and-the-sermon-on-the-mount/&#34;&gt;I tracked it down online. According to Justin Taylor, it was written by Bob Kauflin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy and righteous God, we confess that like Isaiah, we are a people of unclean lips. But it is not only unclean lips we possess. We are people with unclean hands and unclean hearts. We have broken your law times without number, and are guilty of pride, unbelief, self-centeredness and idolatry. Affect our hearts with the severity of our sin and the glory of your righteousness as we now acknowledge our sins in your holy presence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<hr>
<p><strong>Holy and righteous God, we confess that like Isaiah, we are a people of unclean lips. But it is not only unclean lips we possess. We are people with unclean hands and unclean hearts. We have broken your law times without number, and are guilty of pride, unbelief, self-centeredness and idolatry. Affect our hearts with the severity of our sin and the glory of your righteousness as we now acknowledge our sins in your holy presence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have had other gods before you.</strong></p>
<p>We have worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator.</p>
<p>We have sought satisfaction in this world’s pleasures rather than in You.</p>
<p>We have loved to praise our own glory more than yours.</p>
<p><strong>We have taken your name in vain.</strong></p>
<p>We have prayed religious prayers to impress others.</p>
<p>We have uttered your name countless times without reverence or love.</p>
<p>We have listened to others use your name in vain without grieving.</p>
<p><strong>We have murdered in our hearts.</strong></p>
<p>We have often destroyed our neighbor with our tongues.</p>
<p>We have been quick to uncharitably judge others.</p>
<p>We have considered revenge when we were sinned against.</p>
<p><strong>We have committed adultery with our eyes.</strong></p>
<p>We have loved temptation rather than fighting it.</p>
<p>We have lusted after unlawful and immoral pleasures.</p>
<p>We have justified our lusts by using the world as our standard.</p>
<p><strong>We have stolen what is not ours and coveted what belongs to others.</strong></p>
<p>Our lives overflow with discontent, ungratefulness, and envy.</p>
<p>We have complained in the midst of Your abundant provision.</p>
<p>We have sought to exalt ourselves through owning more.</p>
<p><strong>We have lied to you and to others.</strong></p>
<p>We have told distorted truths, half-truths, and untruths.</p>
<p>We have despised the truth to make ourselves look better.</p>
<p>Even in our confession, we look for ways to hide our guilt.</p>
<p><strong>O God, we have sinned against your mercy times without number. We are ashamed to lift up our faces before you, for our iniquities have gone over our heads. If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? How shall we answer you? We lay our hands on our mouths. We have no answer to your righteous wrath and just judgment.</strong></p>
<p>We have no answer. But God Himself has mercifully provided one for us.</p>
<p>“All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.” (Is. 53:6)</p>

&lt;p&gt;To do so, I need to write regularly. For me, that means writing every day—a minimum of 500 words every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last spring, I did a pretty good job of writing regularly. However, I’ve fallen off the wagon for various reasons, and it’s been a bear to get back on!&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Last spring, I did a pretty good job of writing regularly. However, I’ve fallen off the wagon for various reasons, and it’s been a bear to get back on!</p>
<p>So, I’ve decided to put some money on the line, using a service called StickK.</p>
<p>If I don’t write 500 words related to my dissertation every day, StickK will donate $35 dollars every week I fail to the NRA.</p>
<p><em>(I do not like the NRA.)</em></p>
<p>I’m giving this a try for 8 weeks. If it works well, I’ll continue the commitment via StickK!</p>
<p>If you’d like to support me and keep track of my progress on StickK, you can do so by clicking <a href="https://stik.to/r2N">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a habit you’d like to stick to, give StickK a try!</p>

      <title>Bonhoeffer&#39;s &#39;Definition&#39; of &#39;Religion&#39; in Prison: 15 Facets/Aspects</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/bonhoeffers-definition-of-religion-in-prison-15-facets-aspects/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 14:59:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/bonhoeffers-definition-of-religion-in-prison-15-facets-aspects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based upon my own reading of Bonhoeffer’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2AuzaJj&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letters and Papers from Prison&lt;/em&gt; [DBWE 8]&lt;/a&gt;, here is my attempt at a summary list of the facets/aspects of Bonhoeffer’s view of “religion” in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion emphasizes inwardness. [DBWE 8:362, 364, 455–57]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion emphasizes conscience. [DBWE 8:362]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is a temporary phenomenon. [DBWE 8:362, 364]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is manipulative and exploitative. [DBWE 8:363, 366, 426–27, 450, 455–57]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion ignores human strength/knowledge/autonomy and instead focuses on human weakness, ignorance, and boundaries/limits/limitations. [DBWE 8:366, 405–7, 426–27, 450, 455–57, 475–78]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is metaphysical, otherworldly, and escapist. [DBWE 8:364, 372–73, 447–48, 480, 485–86, 501]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is privileged. [DBWE 8:364]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is, like circumcision, no longer a condition for salvation. [DBWE 8:365–66]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion posits a false “God” (a “deus ex machina,” “working hypothesis,” and “stopgap”) on the other side of human boundaries (a shrinking area, as humanity matures) in order to solve human problems. [DBWE 8:366, 405–7, 426–27, 450, 455–57, 475–80, 500–1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is driven by anxiety. [DBWE 8:366, 478]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is individualistic. [DBWE 8:372–73]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religious language has lost its power.[DBWE 8:390]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is a particular posture towards life, capable of being exemplified, not only by pastors, but also by existential philosophers and psychotherapists. [DBWE 8:427, 450, 457]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion is a partial and segmented posture towards life. [DBWE 8:455–57, 482]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion ignores the world’s increasing godlessness. [DBWE 8:480, 482]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a part of my “pedagogical experience” at Wheaton College this semester, I was required to draft a syllabus for an introduction to Christian theology. Feel free to let me know what you think in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the length of this syllabus doesn’t necessarily correspond to the difficulty of this course&lt;/p&gt;

<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<p>This course is an introduction to the methods of systematic theology and the major topics within biblical revelation. Special attention is given to the rationale for these Christian doctrines, their systematic interconnections as well as their development within the history of Christian thought, and their contemporary challenges. This class is your opportunity to reinforce why you believe what you believe and to examine how it impacts your life.</p>
<ul>
<li>~15-20 students, graduate, non-theology majors; assuming that this is the first and last systematic theology course you’ll take (but not the last time you’ll do theology, hopefully!).</li>
<li>Meets twice a week (T/R) for 110 minutes (80 mins of content, 20 minutes of breaks, 10 minutes of intro and conclusion). We’ll be modeling each class session after the “Pomodoro Technique,” in which you do focused work for 20 mins and then reward yourself with a short break. Here’s the rough outline:
<ul>
<li>5 min: opening prayer, introduction</li>
<li>20 min content</li>
<li>5 min break</li>
<li>20 min content</li>
<li>10 min break</li>
<li>20 min content</li>
<li>5 min break</li>
<li>20 min content</li>
<li>5 min: conclusion, final questions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h1>
<p>The student who successfully completes the course will achieve the following goals:</p>

<h1 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="participation-amp-assigned-reading--20">Participation &amp; Assigned Reading – 20%</h2>
<p>Participation will be based on class discussions, which will require students to come to class prepared by having read thoughtfully the assigned readings.</p>
<p>Students will be expected to read all of the required texts in their entirety as indicated on the course schedule. This reading needs to be complete <strong>prior to</strong> the designated class session and students will be graded based on their ability to participate actively in the discussions relative to those readings.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that additional articles may be assigned during the course.</p>
<h2 id="reading-quizzes--20">Reading Quizzes – 20%</h2>
<p>Once a week (the first class session of the week), students will take a brief reading quiz on the main points of the assigned reading (usually from McGrath’s <em>Theology: The Basics</em>) for that day.</p>
<h2 id="reading-presentations--20">Reading Presentations – 20%</h2>
<p>Once a week (the second class session of the week), students will give brief presentations on the assigned primary source readings from McGrath’s <em>Theology: The Basic Readings.</em></p>
<p>In each presentation, the student will have 2 minutes to:<br>
– read a <strong>one-sentence summary</strong> of the passage that they’ve written<br>
– <strong>praise</strong> one aspect/point of the reading<br>
– <strong>critique</strong> one aspect/point of the reading.</p>
<p>The rest of the class will then spend ˜5 minutes responding to each presentation, before moving on to the next presentation.</p>
<p>Each student will give 3-4 presentations over the course of the semester. The schedule for reading presentations will be assigned by the professor at the beginning of the course.</p>
<p><em>Don’t like public speaking?</em> That’s OK. I encourage you to manuscript your presentation and read it.</p>
<h2 id="one-minute-papers--10">One-Minute Papers – 10%</h2>
<p>Over the course of the semester (5 times), students will be given a few minutes in class to write out their answer to a reflection question, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the muddies/least clear idea you encountered in class this week?</li>
<li>What was the most important idea you encountered in class this week?</li>
<li>What important questions remain unanswered for you?</li>
</ul>
<p>These brief papers will be left with or emailed to the professor, and will be graded on a pass/fail basis for each paper (i.e., if you do all 5, you’ll get full credit, if you do 4/5, you’ll get 80% credit).</p>
<h2 id="final-paper--30">Final Paper – 30%</h2>
<p>Over the course of the semester, students will work on a 3,000 word essay on a theological topic of their choice (within the broad range of theological topics covered in Jenson and McGrath).</p>
<p>I expect you to incorporate at least two sources in addition to the assigned readings in this class.</p>
<p>Overall, this project will be worth 30% of the final grade. However, it will be completed in stages. Students will:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pick a topic</strong> and let the professor know by the fourth class session (end of week 2).</li>
<li><strong>Submit a 1-2 page outline, abstract, and bibliography (5% of final grade)</strong> by the tenth class session (end of week 5). Let me know what additional sources you’re thinking about using.</li>
<li>Receive a graded outline/abstract with feedback by the twelfth class session (end of week 6).</li>
<li><strong>Submit a 3,000 word final paper (15% of final grade)</strong> by the twentieth class session (end of week 10).</li>
<li>Receive a graded final paper with feedback by the twenty-fourth class session (end of week 12).</li>
<li><strong>Submit a 3,000 word revised final paper (10% of final grade)</strong> by the thirtieth class session (end of week 15, end of term). You’ll be expected to give me a <strong>one paragraph summary of how you’ve improved the paper</strong>.</li>

<h1 id="rationale-for-textbooks">Rationale for Textbooks</h1>
<p>These days, we’re spoiled for choice when it comes to theology textbooks. I don’t claim to have chosen the very best textbooks, but here are some of my reasons for choosing the texts I did, as well as my reasons for <em>not</em> choosing 5 books that almost made the cut.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-chose-our-texts">Why I Chose Our Texts</h2>
<h3 id="jenson-a-theology-in-outline">Jenson, <em>A Theology in Outline</em></h3>
<p>I wanted us to read a brief book that (1) showcased a theologian <em>doing</em> theology, and not merely surveying theology and (2) gave a taste for how the various aspects of Christian doctrine hang together. Jenson’s book, comprised of lectures he gave to undergraduate students at Princeton at the end of his career, fit the bill nicely. It will give us a taste of what Christian theology can look like as a whole before we dive into its parts. I also hope that it provides enough grist for the mill early in the semester so that you can choose topics that you’re interested in for your papers.</p>
<h3 id="kibbe-from-topic-to-thesis">Kibbe, <em>From Topic to Thesis</em></h3>
<p>Speaking of papers, Kibbe’s book is an excellent primer for theological research and writing. Because people come into this course from different academic backgrounds, some kind of introduction to what research and writing should look like in theology is necessary. I know of no better bang for the buck (and for the page) than this recent book from Kibbe.</p>
<h3 id="mcgrath-theology-the-basics-amp-theology-the-basic-readings">McGrath, <em>Theology: The Basics</em> &amp; <em>Theology: The Basic Readings</em></h3>
<p>I’ll admit that it was difficult to choose between these two shorter books and McGrath’s longer offerings, <em>Christian Theology: An Introduction</em> and <em>The Christian Theology Reader.</em></p>
<p>All of McGrath’s textbooks are excellent in that they expose the reader to the main contours of Christian theology and how those contours have developed over the history of the Church. Furthermore, McGrath teaches you how to engage with primary texts, and gives you guided practice in doing so. Finally, these textbooks have stood the test of time, going through multiple revisions that have incorporated classroom feedback from around the world.</p>
<p>In the end, I went with the shorter options because I’d like us to have time to engage with the works quite thoroughly, instead of feeling like we have to struggle to keep up with the longer books.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’ll be drawing from McGrath’s longer books frequently in my lectures, and I highly recommend them to you for after this course if this semester successfully whets your appetite for Christian theology!</p>
<h2 id="the-top-5-that-almost-made-the-cut">The “Top 5” that Almost Made the Cut</h2>
<p>(Note: these are in alphabetical order, not ranked.)</p>
<h3 id="erickson-christian-theology">Erickson, <em>Christian Theology</em></h3>
<p>Erickson’s work is a classic and would be well worth your time and money to purchase and use as a reference after this course. However, it’s almost 1200 pages long. While that allows him to address many topics that aren’t covered in McGrath’s shorter books, I felt it was too long of a text to require for this semester.</p>
<h3 id="grudem-systematic-theology">Grudem, <em>Systematic Theology</em></h3>
<p>Grudem’s is perhaps the best-known systematic theology in evangelical circles. It has many merits, especially the extent to which it integrates biblical material at every turn (the subtitle is, appropriately, “An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine”). However, it’s just over 1200 pages long—too long, in my opinion, for a one semester survey.</p>
<h3 id="felker-jones-practicing-christian-doctrine">Felker Jones, <em>Practicing Christian Doctrine</em></h3>
<p>This work isn’t a classic, yet! I do suspect, however, that it will gain in popularity because, coming in at under 250 pages, it’s a fantastic introduction to Christian doctrine and the importance of both “thinking and living theologically” (from the book’s subtitle). However, while the book has more of an emphasis on living theologically than McGrath does, it contains less guidance and practice of engaging with primary sources. No single book can do everything, of course, but the associated reader was a big reason why I chose McGrath over Felker Jones.</p>
<h3 id="oden-classic-christianity">Oden, <em>Classic Christianity</em></h3>
<p>This book is a wonderful resource for finding out what the consensus teaching of the Church, emphasis on the early Church, has been on the various main topics of Christian theology—“classic consensual ecumenical teaching,” as Oden puts it. It reads almost like a systematically-categorized catalogue of quotations from the early Church. I think it deserves a place on your bookshelf alongside another more “standard” systematic theology like Erickson or van der Kooi and van den Brink. However, at just over 900 pages, it’s too long to work well as a main text for this course.</p>
<h3 id="van-der-kooi-amp-van-den-brink-christian-dogmatics">Van der Kooi &amp; van den Brink, <em>Christian Dogmatics</em></h3>
<p>This is another resource that isn’t a classic yet, at least not in the USA, because it’s only been available in English translation since 2017. However, it’s already a classic work in Dutch since it came out in the Netherlands in 2012. Just like Erickson and Grudem above, this is a pedagogically useful and comprehensive systematic theology. However, just like Erickson and Grudem, at 800 pages, this book is also too long to serve as our main text.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Erickson and Grudem approach things from a particularly Baptist perspective, van der Kooi and van den Brink approach things from a particularly Dutch Reformed perspective. Nothing against these perspectives, of course, but (1) I don’t hold them and (2) I think McGrath (as well as Felker Jones, Oden, and others) does a better job of exposing us to as broad/mainstream an exposition of Christian theology as possible.</p>

Thankfully, it &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/update-you-can-now-search-for-bible-citations-in-the-digital-karl-barth-library-again/&#34;&gt;appears to have been fixed&lt;/a&gt; (although it still has issues).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Previously, I wrote about how <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/whats-gone-wrong-with-the-digital-karl-barth-library/">the Scripture search tool in the Digital Karl Barth Library was broken</a>. Thankfully, it <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/update-you-can-now-search-for-bible-citations-in-the-digital-karl-barth-library-again/">appears to have been fixed</a> (although it still has issues).

<p>However, I’m now having some issues with the copy of <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/5758/barths-church-dogmatics">Barth’s Church Dogmatics I purchased via Logos Bible Software</a>.</p>
<p>Before I complain, let me first say how grateful I am that Logos is MUCH more user-friendly than the Digital Karl Barth Library.</p>
<p>As an apparent example of this user-friendliness, my Logos copy of the Church Dogmatics (CD) displays what appear to be the original German (Kirchliche Dogmatik, KD) page numbers in search results by default.</p>
<p>At first, this struck me as very helpful.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<ol>
<li>These KD page numbers aren’t accurate! They’re only tied to section headings. So, for example, “KD I.2 p. 305” displays in Logos for the section that runs from KD 1.2, 304 to 324. Then, it skips ahead to display “KD I.2 p. 324” until page 356!</li>
<li>There’s no way (that I know of) to change the default display in the search results so that the accurate English page numbers (CD I.2 p. 310) are displayed. Instead, you have to click on each search result to open it, and then click on the “KD” page number to display a drop-down menu that shows the correct English “CD” page number.</li>
</ol>
<p>Granted, perhaps ballpark German page numbers are the best that can be expected from a resource that was purchased in English.</p>
<p>However, it’s pretty frustrating not to be able to see the correct English page numbers at a glance!</p>
<p>OK, end of rant. Back to research and writing…</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’d like to pray this week’s collect again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>It’s been a particularly difficult week here at Church of the Savior.</p>
<p>Since the end of the sermon last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve learned that Father Kevin’s been diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.</li>
<li>We’ve lost a founding and foundational member of this church, Marilyn Stewart.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, there are many other things that we’re carrying as individuals and as a body.</p>
<p>So, this evening, it sure feels like we gather as “those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.” The shadow of a particular death, as we mourn the loss of our beloved sister, Marilyn.</p>
<p>And so we gather tonight as those who need “the tender compassion of our God.” We need “the dawn from on high” to break upon us,” give us light, and “guide our feet into the way of peace.”</p>
<p>We need peace. We need light. We need comfort.</p>
<p>And instead we are given John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Wild-eyed, crazy-haired, locust-eating John the Baptist. God’s fiery messenger, crying out in the wilderness: “Prepare ye the way of the Lord! Repent, you brood of vipers!”</p>
<p>Nothing <em>against</em> John, of course. But, from our perspective at least, isn’t this unfortunate liturgical timing?</p>
<p>I mean, come on, John. We’re struggling here.</p>
<p>Can’t you come back another time? Maybe during Lent?</p>
<p>Right now, we need some <em>good</em> news. We need some comfort.</p>
<p>Do we really need to hear from John the Baptist right now?</p>
<h2 id="big-idea">Big Idea</h2>
<p>I think we do, and here’s why.</p>
<p>As we wait for the Lord’s return, we must also, like John the Baptist, prepare the way of the Lord in the wilderness. In darkness and the shadow of death.</p>
<p>And John reminds us that <strong>preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is not comfortable. But it is comforting.</strong></p>
<p>Preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is not comfortable. It is not characterized by comfort.</p>
<p>But preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is comforting, because it brings God’s comfort.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="first-what-does-it-mean-to-prepare-the-way-of-the-lord">First, what does it mean to “prepare the way of the Lord”?</h2>
<p>Well, it simply means to get things ready for God’s arrival.</p>
<p>But it specifically means to get a PEOPLE ready for God’s arrival.</p>
<p>We’re not talking about a literal road here that needs to be leveled and straightened and paved.</p>
<p>We’re talking about a group of people who need to get prepared for their God to arrive.</p>
<p>That’s what John the Baptist is up to. He’s getting people from the house of Israel ready to receive their Lord’s arrival as <em>good news</em> of deliverance, instead of as <em>bad news</em> of judgment.</p>
<p>The angel Gabriel said as much to John’s father, Zechariah, in Luke 1:16-17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And [John] will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God. He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. <strong>He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord.</strong> He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and he will cause those who are rebellious to accept the wisdom of the godly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when Zechariah himself prophesied about John’s ministry, in Luke 1:76-77, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And you, my little son, will be called the prophet of the Most High, because you will prepare the way for the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You will tell his people how to find salvation through forgiveness of their sins.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, preparing the way of the Lord means getting people ready for God to arrive.</p>
<p>John prepared the way for our Lord Jesus Christ’s first arrival.</p>
<p>We Christians prepare the way for Lord’s second arrival, when he returns to “judge the living and the dead,” on the one hand, and to “wipe away every tear from [our] eyes” (Rev. 7:17), on the other.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-then-is-getting-people-ready-for-christs-return-not-comfortable">Why, then, is getting people ready for Christ’s return not comfortable?</h2>
<h3 id="1-because-its-done-in-the-wilderness-of-human-history">1. Because it’s done in the wilderness of human history.</h3>
<p>We prepare the way of the Lord in the midst of a world that, though it still belongs to God, has been infected and affected by sin and death at every level.</p>
<p>But when faced with such a world, the good news of Jesus Christ is not escapist. It’s not some pie-in-the-sky pipe dream that touches lightly on the carnage of human history. No!</p>
<p>Instead, the good news of Jesus Christ doubles-down on space and time, on the here and now, on flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Did you notice all those names at the beginning of our Gospel lesson? It started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if all Luke wanted to do was to indicate the date, he could have stopped right there. But instead, he continues to list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pontius Pilate</li>
<li>Herod</li>
<li>Philip</li>
<li>Lysanias</li>
<li>Annas</li>
<li>Caiaphas</li>
</ul>
<p>Very real, very powerful men. Men with the very real blood of the people of God–of the Son of God!–on their hands.</p>
<p>And where does the word of God show up? To John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.</p>
<p>You see, the word of God offers us no escape from human history. It instead offers us a redemption of human history.</p>
<p>This redemption, as it turns out, includes some reversals of fortunes.</p>
<p>As Mary sang in Luke 1:52-53, when God redeems, he brings down rulers—like those 7 powerful men we just mentioned—from their thrones. But he lifts up the humble.</p>
<p>When God redeems, he fills the hungry with good things, but he sends the rich away empty.</p>
<p>As our Gospel lesson put it, quoting Isaiah 40:3-5, when God redeems, valleys are raised up, mountains are brought down, crooked roads are made straight, and rough roads are made smooth.</p>
<p>Yes! Amen! That sounds like good news! Especially when we’re humbled and hungry in the valley of the shadow of death!</p>
<p>I say we get some bulldozers and start chipping away at those mountains.</p>
<p>I say we knock some cracks into the foundations of the halls of power.</p>
<p>I say we let the Tiberiuses of this world know that their days in power are numbered.</p>
<p>But here there is a second reason why preparing the way of the Lord is uncomfortable.</p>
<h3 id="2-because-it-begins-with-us-the-people-of-god">2. Because it begins with us, the people of God.</h3>
<p>John doesn’t go to Tiberius’ palace. He doesn’t pay a visit to Pontius Pilate’s mansion.</p>
<p>He <em>does</em> speak truth to Herod’s power, which gets him thrown into prison…</p>
<p>But the summary of John’s ministry that we get in Luke 3:3 is that John tells ordinary Israelites that they need to repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of their sins.</p>
<p>Wait a second, John. I thought this was about reversal.</p>
<p><em>We’ve</em> been brought low, by Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and now Rome. Surely <em>we</em> don’t need to repent. We’re the victims here! Go tell the Romans and those Roman-loving sellouts to repent.</p>
<p>But, of course, God’s redemption involves both reversal and renewal.</p>
<p>The good news of Jesus Christ is radical in that it calls both strong and the weak, both the oppressors and the oppressed to <strong>repent</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>To turn away from sin and toward God.</li>
<li>To embrace God’s agenda by living a transformed life.</li>
</ul>
<p>You see, God doesn’t need our bulldozers. He wants our repentance and our obedience.</p>
<p>As our collect reminds us this week, if the return of Jesus is to be received as good news, it must be preceded by repentance. Otherwise, the return of the Judge is bad news for the unrepentant.</p>
<p>This reminds me of Jesus’ words in Luke 18:7-8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. <strong>However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Jesus returns, will he find faith on the earth?</p>
<p>Getting people ready for Christ’s return in the wilderness is not comfortable, because we have to ask ourselves that question before we ask it of anyone else.</p>
<p>And yet, I insist, preparing the way of the Lord is comforting!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-is-getting-ourselves-ready-for-christs-return-comforting">Why is getting ourselves ready for Christ’s return comforting?</h2>
<p>I find it fascinating that all four Gospels link the fiery ministry of John the Baptist with Isaiah 40.</p>
<p>Isaiah 40 is a major turning point in the book of Isaiah. Very broadly speaking, chapters 1-39 mostly contain oracles of God’s judgment.</p>
<p>And then we get to Isaiah 40, which begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comfort, comfort my people,<br>
says your God.<br>
Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,<br>
and proclaim to her<br>
that her hard service has been completed,<br>
that her sin has been paid for,<br>
that she has received from the Lord’s hand<br>
double for all her sins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “voice crying in the wilderness,” which all four Gospels say is John the Baptist, is preparing the way—getting people ready–for the arrival of God’s comfort in and through Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3 id="1-preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-brings-comfort-first-because-though-we-have-sinned-and-need-to-repent-forgiveness-is-freely-available-through-jesus-christ">1. Preparing the way of the Lord brings comfort, first, because, though we have sinned and need to repent, forgiveness is freely available through Jesus Christ.</h3>
<p>We are not saved by how well we repent. If we were, that would be very bad news. Instead, we are saved by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Turning away from sin and toward Jesus in repentance and faith might not be comfortable, but it’s comforting because he’s more worthy of our faith than we are!</p>
<p>We don’t have to run the rat race of trying to earn God’s favor and give our own lives meaning. Instead, we can cling to Jesus and find forgiveness, purpose, and value in him.</p>
<h3 id="2-preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-brings-comfort-second-because-the-wilderness-will-not-have-the-final-word">2. Preparing the way of the Lord brings comfort, second, because the wilderness will not have the final word.</h3>
<p>The word of God in the wilderness is NOT “get used to it! This is the way things are always going to be!” NO!</p>
<p>I don’t care how common they are, even in the church. Sin, death, and disease are <em>not</em> the way things are supposed to be.</p>
<p>God will not let them stand forever. He is at work against them even now, and one day he will return to to abolish them forever.</p>
<p>So, getting ourselves ready for Christ’s return is comforting, even when done through tears, because the people thus prepared are those who await the fulfillment of Revelation 7:16-17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Never again will they hunger;<br>
never again will they thirst.<br>
The sun will not beat down on them,’<br>
nor any scorching heat.<br>
For the Lamb at the center of the throne<br>
will be their shepherd;<br>
‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’<br>
‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No more decay. No more disease. No more death.</p>
<p>That’s what we’re preparing for. And that’s why it’s comforting.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-should-we-prepare-the-way-of-the-lord-today-at-savior">How should we prepare the way of the Lord today, at Savior?</h2>
<p>How should we get ourselves ready for Christ’s return?</p>
<p>Well, Father Kevin is going to preach more about repentance based on the content of John the Baptist’s preaching next week.</p>
<p>But, in the meantime, I’ve got three pastoral suggestions based on this week’s introduction of John’s ministry.</p>
<h3 id="1-avoid-escapism-tell-the-truth-about-the-wilderness">1. Avoid escapism. Tell the truth about the wilderness.</h3>
<p>Maybe I’m just speaking to myself here, but it seems like one of the easiest approaches to the suffering we’re enduring here at Savior would be to ignore it. Put a smile on.</p>
<p>How are you doing? Fine. You? Fine. Everybody’s “fine.”</p>
<p>Nope. That’s not how the church is supposed to behave in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Instead, let’s be honest with God and with each other about the wilderness in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p>How are you doing? Honestly. How are you really doing?</p>
<p>Maybe instead of saying “fine,” you should tell the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m lonely.</li>
<li>I’m afraid.</li>
<li>I’m overwhelmed.</li>
<li>I’m angry.</li>
<li>I don’t understand why God is allowing this to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Friends, if the gospel tells us anything, it tells us that things right now are not the way they’re supposed to be.</p>
<p>And, if we can’t be honest about that here, in the church, what hope do we have?</p>
<p>Yes, we should be grateful. Yes, we should be hopeful.</p>
<p>But we also need to be unflinchingly truthful. Especially in difficult seasons like the one we’re in right now.</p>
<h3 id="2-radically-resist-busyness-and-hurry">2. Radically resist busyness and hurry.</h3>
<p>If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s one of our stated values here at Savior. It’s baked into the culture of this church.</p>
<p>But I bring it up again because of the temptation that I mentioned earlier to grab a bulldozer and try to level the mountains on our own.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that the gospel shouldn’t lead us to oppose the effects of sin and death in the world around us. It should!</p>
<p>But we can’t allow mere activism to replace the uncomfortable work of examination and repentance.</p>
<p>When the going gets tough, it’s often easier to lose ourselves in our work—perhaps especially when it’s “kingdom work”!—than it is to stop and tell the truth about how we’re doing.</p>
<p>Confession and repentance are both more difficult and less comfortable than volunteering, giving, and even preaching.</p>
<p>So, let’s not use getting lost in the “Lord’s work” as an excuse for avoiding the Lord’s word.</p>
<h3 id="3-lead-the-way-in-repentance-by-preaching-the-gospel-to-ourselves-daily">3. Lead the way in repentance by preaching the gospel to ourselves daily.</h3>
<p>It might not be comfortable, but God’s comforting word to us in the wilderness is that we are sinners and we need to repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of our sins.</p>
<p>We need to turn away from sin and toward our forgiving and comforting God.</p>
<p>We need to be united through baptism into Christ’s death, that we might experience the new life of his resurrection.</p>
<p>And, here’s the thing, we never outgrow our baptism. But we often need to return to it.</p>
<p>We never outgrow our need to hear the gospel, repent, and cling to Jesus. But we often need to be reminded of it.</p>
<p>So let’s remind ourselves. Let’s remind each other.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Like I said earlier, right now, this week, at Church of the Savior in Wheaton, IL, we need some good news.</p>
<p>We need some comfort.</p>
<p>We need to hear from John the Baptist, because he points us to Jesus.</p>
<p>And the good news of Jesus Christ might be uncomfortable, but it’s the only source of true comfort in the wilderness, in the darkness, and in the shadow of death.</p>
<p>So, like John the Baptist, let’s prepare the way of the Lord.</p>
<p>Let’s get a people ready for Christ’s return by getting ourselves ready, every day, to repent and cling to Jesus for forgiveness and comfort we so desperately need.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <title>What&#39;s gone wrong with the Digital Karl Barth Library?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/whats-gone-wrong-with-the-digital-karl-barth-library/</link>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/whats-gone-wrong-with-the-digital-karl-barth-library/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt; make progress on &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/&#34;&gt;my dissertation (“Scriptural but Not Religious: Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion”)&lt;/a&gt;, I’m longing for the day when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karl Barth’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://barth.ptsem.edu/research/kb-gesamtausgabe&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gesamtausgabe&lt;/em&gt; (Collected Edition)&lt;/a&gt; is finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are translated into a critical English edition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are available within the same database/framework as Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Works in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/53339/the-works-of-dietrich-bonhoeffer&#34;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/152576/dietrich-bonhoeffer-werke&#34;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; (DBWE and DBW).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dkbl.alexanderstreet.com&#34;&gt;Digital Karl Barth Library&lt;/a&gt;, provided by &lt;a href=&#34;https://alexanderstreet.com/&#34;&gt;Alexander Street Press&lt;/a&gt; is the best resource out there for searching the text of Barth’s works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I <em>slowly</em> make progress on <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">my dissertation (“Scriptural but Not Religious: Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion”)</a>, I’m longing for the day when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Karl Barth’s <a href="http://barth.ptsem.edu/research/kb-gesamtausgabe"><em>Gesamtausgabe</em> (Collected Edition)</a> is finished.</li>
<li>They are translated into a critical English edition.</li>
<li>They are available within the same database/framework as Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Works in <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/53339/the-works-of-dietrich-bonhoeffer">English</a> and <a href="https://www.logos.com/product/152576/dietrich-bonhoeffer-werke">German</a> (DBWE and DBW).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, the <a href="https://dkbl.alexanderstreet.com">Digital Karl Barth Library</a>, provided by <a href="https://alexanderstreet.com/">Alexander Street Press</a> is the best resource out there for searching the text of Barth’s works.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, it appears that the Digital Karl Barth Library [DKBL] has recently updated/changed its search software. I’m now having a <em>very</em> difficult time searching for biblical citations in the database, whereas this used to be very straightforward.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://dkbl.alexanderstreet.com/dkbl.help.html">the current help page</a> (which appears to be obsolete since the search software change):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>3.2.2 Biblical Citation</strong></p>
<p>Description: This field enables the user to locate all instances where Barth refers to a book, chapter, or verse of the Bible. Since citations in the source edition may be formatted in a variety of ways (consider “Genesis 3,” “Gen. III,” and “the third chapter of the first book of Moses”), we have inserted uniform tags around each citation. From the user’s standpoint, this value-added tagging effectively eliminates the variations in spelling and format, and allows one to return a comprehensive and accurate set of results for any biblical citation.</p>
<p>How to use this field: Use this field to search for citations of a book, chapter, or verse of the Bible.</p>
<p>Practical Example: Show all instances where Barth cites Romans 8:28.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Biblical Citation field on the Advanced Search page.</li>
<li>Select “Romans” from the drop-down list in the Book box.</li>
<li>Enter the number “8” into the Chapter box.</li>
<li>Enter the number “28” into the Verse box.</li>
<li>Click on the Search button.</li>
<li>The system responds with a list of all instances where Barth cites Romans 8:28.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is no longer a “Biblical Citation” search field. Instead, there is a main search terms box with expandable “Search Options.”</p>
<p>Promisingly, these “Search Options” include fields for “Book,” “Book2,” “From Chapter,” “To Chapter,” “From Verse,” and “To Verse.”</p>
<p>And yet, using “Exodus 32” as an example (which I know occurs as “Ex. 32” on page 328 of <em>Church Dogmatics</em> III/1), I can’t get the search results to produce anything!</p>
<p>At least the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works and Werke have thorough Scripture indexes for the entire series. There is no such index for the as-yet-incomplete <em>Gesamtausgabe</em>, so the DKBL’s Biblical Citation search function used to be a great and much-needed tool!</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m missing something about how the new DKBL search software works. Or maybe there’s another, better tool out there to perform Scripture searches in Barth’s works. If you know anything, please advise in the comments below!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This sermon, on Mark 8:27-38 and James 3:1-12, was originally preached on September 16, 2018 at <a href="https://www.christredeemermke.org/">Christ Redeemer Anglican Church in Milwaukee, WI</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Would you pray with me?</p>
<p><strong>O God, because without you we are not able to please you—especially in what we say!—mercifully grant that your Holy Spirit may in all things direct and rule our hearts, so that the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts might be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, our strength and our redeemer. Amen.</strong></p>
<p>Well, friends, I’ve gotta say that, although it’s a pleasure to be here with you this morning, it honestly freaks me out a little bit to preach at a church I’ve never been to before, when the New Testament reading begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. For all of us make many mistakes.”!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The insecure perfectionist in me wants to shut up and sit down before I say something wrong! Maybe we should just read the rest of the book of James and call it a day.</p>
<p>But, of course, James’ warning makes sense. Christian teachers <em>ought</em> to be judged with greater strictness, because, to put it simply, words matter—especially when we’re talking about who God is, what God has done, and what it means to live as God’s people.</p>
<p>Although headlines these days might lead us to believe that you can say absolutely anything—no matter how ridiculous or offensive—without suffering lasting consequences, James reminds us that God cares about what you say! Even what you say online, I might add!</p>
<p>Of course, this is somewhat unfortunate because, as James also reminds us, it is so much easier to talk your way <em>into</em> trouble than <em>out of</em> it!</p>
<p>It’s very easy to say the self-serving thing, the dishonest thing, the inflammatory thing.</p>
<p>It’s much more difficult to say the true thing, the loving thing, the wise thing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because, as James reminds us,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell…</p>
<p>…no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the tongue is a relatively small part of the human body, just like bits in a horse’s mouth or the rudder of a ship, it can produce some some pretty big changes.</p>
<p>What we say and how we say it can completely change the course of our lives and the lives of others around us. And a <em>careless</em> word spoken to a parent, a spouse, a child, or a friend can ruin lives.</p>
<p>And, here’s the kicker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With [the tongue] we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.</p>
<p>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing.</p>
<p>My brothers, these things ought not to be so.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but that last part makes me even more nervous.</p>
<p>God doesn’t just care what we say to or about him. God also cares about what we say to or about other people, his image-bearers!</p>
<p>And, if I’m honest, this puts me to shame when I think about how much more time and effort I put into choosing my words carefully in a sermon, compared to how careless I often am when speaking to people who were created in the image of God.</p>
<p>Sure, I still make mistakes in the sermons! But at least I <em>try</em> to think through a sermon.</p>
<p>Yet, I’ll often lash-out at someone without a second thought!</p>
<p>Whether you’ve ever preached before or not, I trust you’ve been there, too.</p>
<p>We’ve all said some things we later regretted. We’ve all learned that it’s easier to talk yourself into trouble than out of it.</p>
<h2 id="main-point">Main Point</h2>
<p>My main point this morning is, I think, rather simple to understand. But it’s very difficult to live.</p>
<p>It’s this: The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<p>The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<p>Our passage from James has already reminded us that taming the tongue—being wise and controlled in how you communicate—is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>And James has convicted us that, even though it’s difficult, there’s no excuse for using our tongues to praise God one moment and then to trash the people God has made the next.</p>
<p>This leaves us in a bit of a bind! At least we’re not alone.</p>
<h2 id="mark-827-38">Mark 8:27-38</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at our Gospel text in Mark 8.</p>
<p>When Jesus asks his disciples in Mark chapter 8 verse 29 “who do you say that I am?,” Peter hits a home run and says, straight-up, “You are the Christ.”</p>
<p>That is, “you are the Messiah.”</p>
<p>That is, “you are God’s promised deliverer of his people, you are the savior-king that we’ve been waiting for.”</p>
<p>And, look at that! Here’s a bit of good news: by the grace of God, human speech can be accurate! It can even be used to accomplish God’s will in the world (just read Peter’s later letters).</p>
<p>But, of course, things quickly go downhil for Peter. In Mark’s telling of the story, the next thing Peter does is talk himself into trouble. He takes Jesus aside and rebukes him for Jesus’ clear teaching about his upcoming suffering, death, and resurrection.</p>
<p>Now, this isn’t the exact same as “cursing” Jesus. It was probably more of a reprimand, like: “Jesus, what are you talking about? If you’re the Messiah, you’re not going to suffer and die. You’re going to conquer! And we’re going to conquer with you!”</p>
<p>Still, even by the disciples’ standards in the Gospels, rebuking Jesus is pretty bad. Peter earns himself the stunning rebuke from Jesus in verse 33:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to the crowd and his disciples, in verse 34 and 35, Jesus then says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</p>
<p>For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, “no pain, no gain!”</p>
<p>Peter was wrong. The Messiah will be victorious, even over death itself! But he would suffer first.</p>
<p>If we want to experience the joy and the glory of Jesus’ resurrection, there’s no other way to get there than to take up our cross and follow him through his cross.</p>
<p>What does it mean to take up your cross and follow Jesus?</p>
<p>It means that following Jesus requires a painful death. Sometimes, a literal death of martyrdom!</p>
<p>But first and foremost following Jesus requires a death to ourselves and our selfish desires. To take up your cross is to deny yourself.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there are many different ways to take up your cross and follow Jesus in every single area of your life.</p>
<p>This morning, I’d like to focus on what this looks like when it comes to communication.</p>
<p>And I’d like to suggest that the only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<p>The only way to be wise and controlled in how you communicate is to die to yourself for Jesus’ sake and for the gospel’s sake.</p>
<p>So, we must deny ourselves in order to tame our tongues when we speak to God and to God’s image-bearers.</p>
<p>This is because self-interest is at the root of all foolish and undisciplined speech!</p>
<p>Think about it, every stupid thing we’ve ever said can be traced back to our desires to get ahead!</p>
<p>Self-restraint and trying harder are not enough.</p>
<p>Only the self-denial that follows Jesus to the cross will allow Jesus to set us free from our selfish desires.</p>
<p>The good news is that, although the human tongue is, to use the technical theological term, <em>jacked-up</em> by sin, it is not beyond being saved and used by God.</p>
<p>Rescued by Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit, we can be set free to glorify God the Father by loving God and loving others, especially in how we communicate.</p>
<p>The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-that-look-like-though">What does that look like, though?</h2>
<p>Admittedly, the passage we read from James today doesn’t give us much to go on as far as how to apply these things to our lives today.</p>
<p>Instead, the main point of James 3:1-12 is that, although it’s incredibly difficult to control what you say, it still makes absolutely no sense to bless God and curse the human beings God has made.</p>
<p>The implied point of the passage is that we should not do that. Instead, we should both bless God and bless God’s image-bearers.</p>
<p>That is, in addition to praising God for who he is and what he has done, we should communicate with others for their good and well-being, instead of for our own selfish interests.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>Well, let me offer some suggestions from the book of James as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="first-as-our-passage-implies-we-need-to-realize-that-whenever-we-are-communicating-with-another-person-we-are-either-talking-to-god-or-to-one-of-gods-image-bearers">First, as our passage implies, we need to realize that, whenever we are communicating with another person, we are either talking to God or to one of God’s image-bearers.</h3>
<p>Though it might seem mundane and unimportant, our daily communication with God’s image-bearers is a huge area of our life in which we either obey or disobey Jesus’ command to deny ourselves, take up our crosses, and follow him.</p>
<p>With our speech, we’re always either building people up in selfless love or tearing them down in selfish pride. (Or, on our good days, we’re manipulating them with flattery.)</p>
<p>We need to take a similar kind of care when we’re talking to God and to God’s image-bearers.</p>
<p>As James seems to focus on later in chapter 4, this should start within the church, by refusing to speak evil of our brothers and sisters in Christ.</p>
<p>But then, of course, this should overflow outside the church, by communicating with every human being we encounter for their benefit.</p>
<p>Now, as Jesus himself modeled for us, this “speaking the truth in love” will sometimes involve speaking uncomfortable truths. But there is a difference between doing this for others’ benefit—even if it makes them unhappy—and doing so for your own benefit.</p>
<p>Telling the difference between speaking hard truths in love and speaking them in self-interest requires wisdom.</p>
<h3 id="second-we-need-to-pray">Second, we need to pray.</h3>
<p>As James 1:5 puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given how difficult it is to tame our tongues, we should regularly ask God for the wisdom and the ability to communicate in a way that blesses him and his image-bearers.</p>
<p>It could be as simple as praying the last verse of Psalm 19 each morning before leaving the house (or leaving your bed):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="third-we-need-to-slow-down-and-calm-down-in-our-communication">Third, we need to slow down and calm down in our communication.</h3>
<p>Consider James 1:19-20:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should tape those verses to every screen in our lives.</p>
<p>We need to realize that the 24-hour news cycle, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are all conditioning us to disobey God.</p>
<p>They are training us to be slow to listen, or to only listen to those with extreme positions that we agree with.</p>
<p>They are training us to be quick to speak.</p>
<p>And they are certainly training us to be quick to anger.</p>
<p>What in our lives is training us in the other direction? Toward wisdom? Toward the righteousness of God?</p>
<p>How much time do we spend being pulled in either direction?</p>
<p>Perhaps we need to pray for the wisdom and the ability to turn off the TV and log off Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="finally-we-need-to-back-up-our-words-with-our-actions">Finally, we need to back up our words with our actions.</h3>
<p>Taming the tongue doesn’t just mean not saying anything bad. And it doesn’t just mean saying good things. It also includes speaking in a way that is consistent with your behavior.</p>
<p>James 1:22 tells us to “be doers of the word, and not hearers only.”</p>
<p>James 1:26-27 sees right through our pretensions and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person’s religion is worthless.</p>
<p>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As James 2:14-17 puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?</p>
<p>If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying the words “go in peace, be warmed and filled” to a poor hungry person is not wrong.</p>
<p>Doing so without doing the works of warming and filling them is.</p>
<p>True faith in Jesus Christ shows itself in both words and works.</p>
<p>The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>So, Father, we ask that you would send your Holy Spirit to give us the wisdom and the ability to bless you and your image-bearers in how we communicate. Redeemed by his blood, may we display your Son’s self-sacrificial love in what we say and how we live. Amen.</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This upcoming semester, I’ll be taking a seminar on the Doctrine of Creation from my supervisor Marc Cortez. I’ll also be doing my “pedagogical experience” in a Christian Theology course—also with Marc Cortez.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>8 Questions to Ask While Reading Theology</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/8-questions-to-ask-while-reading-theology/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2018 15:11:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/8-questions-to-ask-while-reading-theology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading Beth Felker Jones’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2vLkeEo&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practicing Christian Doctrine: An Introduction to Thinking and Living Theologically&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I came across the following list of extremely helpful questions to ask while reading theology (on page 29).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the key Christian teachings being articulated? What is the author’s driving concern or main theme?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What counts for the author as authoritative (Scripture, tradition, reason, experience…)? Is the author’s theological method implicit or explicit?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the author deal with the witness of Scripture?&lt;br&gt;
a. Implicitly? Explicitly?&lt;br&gt;
b. Does the witness of the Old Testament matter? The New?&lt;br&gt;
c. What biblical themes are privileged?&lt;br&gt;
d. What interpretive principles are at work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do these claims relate to other doctrines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does context (including gender, race, class, culture, and time) shape the theological voice? Is the theologian conscious of this? How does your context shape your evaluation of the piece?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice reading charitably. What is the best possible interpretation of how the piece reflects an attempt to be faithful to Jesus Christ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do these theological claims relate to the life of faith? Doe you bring other questions from your experience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this theological proposal were taken seriously, how would it shape Christian practice? Would it affect our participation in spiritual disciplines? Our understanding of faithful living? Our practice of evangelism? Our life as the church?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Eva Joy Steele: A Birth Story</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a self-indulgently long story. The gist of it is that my wife, Rachel, was unexpectedly induced due to gestational hypertension at 37 weeks, right before we were supposed to head to Pennsylvania for her sister’s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy induction and labor, our beautiful daughter, Eva Joy Steele, was born at 5:46am on Friday, July 20, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s all you’d like to know, great! If you’d like to know more about what went down, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="it-all-started-on-tuesday-july-17-2018">It all started on Tuesday, July 17, 2018.</h2>
<p>The main thing <em>I</em> had scheduled that day was a get-together with my doctoral supervisor and his other students to discuss part two of our reading of Friedrich Schleiermacher’s <em>Christian Faith</em>.</p>
<p>As per usual, before diving into our book discussion, we went around the table and gave life updates. The gist of mine was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we had a bit of a “scare” last week, because Rachel’s blood pressure was slightly elevated at her midwife appointment. So, they sent us over to get an <a href="http://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/non-stress-test/">NST (fetal non-stress test)</a>, more blood pressure measurements, and an ultrasound to measure the baby.</p>
<p>Thankfully, everything looked fine. We’re pretty sure her high blood pressure is due to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/white-coat-hypertension/faq-20057792">“white coat hypertension,”</a> because her BP always looks fine at home and at work.</p>
<p>So, we’ve got another midwife appointment this afternoon, but we should be all set to drive out to Pennsylvania tomorrow for the wedding this weekend.</p>
<p><cite>~Me.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, on Saturday, July 21, Rachel’s sister, Hannah, was getting married. Rachel was the Matron of Honor, and I was the officiant for the wedding.</p>
<p>Or at least, that’s what we were planning on.</p>
<h2 id="the-midwife-appointment-400-pm-tuesday">The Midwife Appointment (4:00 pm, Tuesday)</h2>
<p>I met Rachel at Elmhurst Hospital for our midwife appointment on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Just like the previous week, her initial blood pressure was high. So, they sent us over to triage on the Labor and Delivery unit for another NST.</p>
<p>“No big deal,” we thought. “Things will come back normal again, and we’ll be on our way to Pennsylvania tomorrow.”</p>
<p>In fact, while Rachel headed over to triage, I went out to pick us up some food for dinner.</p>
<h2 id="triage-elmhurst-hospital-labor-and-delivery-unit-500pm-tuesday">Triage, Elmhurst Hospital, Labor and Delivery Unit (˜5:00pm, Tuesday)</h2>
<p>When I got over to the triage room, Mediterranean pita wraps in tow, Rachel was already hooked up to the monitors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, more than two of her BPs were higher than 140/90. To us, this didn’t seem like that big of a deal. Surely it was just a combination of nerves and stress!</p>
<p>However, Rachel met the diagnostic criteria for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_hypertension">gestational hypertension</a>. And, as a midwife explained to us in the triage room, the treatment for gestational hypertension these days is to induce labor starting at 37 weeks gestation.</p>
<p>Which, for us, meant getting induced in about 7 hours, shortly after midnight. The only other alternative was to leave <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_medical_advice">AMA: “Against Medical Advice.”</a></p>
<p>To put it lightly, this was difficult news to receive. We went from thinking that we were going to be on our way the next day to Pennsylvania for the wedding to realizing that we were going to be in the hospital until we came home with a baby!</p>
<p>So, first, there was the disappointment/stress of missing the wedding. Then, there were the other questions: Were we ready for the baby to arrive? (The nursery wasn’t due to be finished until around August 8, the due date.) Was Rachel’s body ready to deliver at 37 weeks? Was this labor and delivery more likely to end in a C-section? Would the baby be OK, or would she face health complications from being born too early?</p>
<p>The midwife reassured us that the baby was not going to be significantly more likely to have health complications from being delivered at 37 weeks vs. waiting to 38 or 39 weeks to induce labor.</p>
<p>On my end, it was helpful to hear that the reason gestational hypertension is a concern, even though it’s not as serious as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia">pre-eclampsia</a>, is that the mother’s blood pressure can very quickly and unexpectedly get out of control late in the pregnancy. There’s no way of telling on the front end, however, which mothers/babies will be fine all the way through and which will die unexpectedly. So, inducing labor at 37 weeks across the board for gestational hypertension has been determined to be the safest course of action.</p>
<p>So, while it was going to be a bummer to miss the wedding, I reassured myself/Rachel that, at least, we would get to meet our baby girl soon! Plus, even if we had been able to sweet-talk our way into a deal where they let us go home and come back for blood pressure checks each day, I wasn’t sure that “freedom” would be worth the extra stress.</p>
<h2 id="admitted-to-elmhurst-hospital-labor-and-delivery-unit-700pm-tuesday">Admitted to Elmhurst Hospital, Labor and Delivery Unit (˜7:00pm, Tuesday)</h2>
<p>So, we literally walked right across the hallway from triage to our pre-partum hospital room on the Labor and Delivery unit.</p>
<p>After getting settled, we began the process of letting friends and family know what was happening.</p>
<p>I let my doctoral supervisor and fellow students know that I had spoken too soon that afternoon, and that we wouldn’t be making the trip out to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I also let our landlord know that we would be needing that baby room finished sooner than initially expected!</p>
<p>And, as I headed back home to grab supplies for our stay at the hospital, I called my parents to let them know that their granddaughter would be arriving sooner than expected.</p>
<p>Back at the apartment by myself, calling Rachel to double-check what she needed in her “go-bag,” it was a bit surreal to realize that, most likely, the next time I would come home we would have our daughter with us!</p>
<p>I somewhat frantically tidied-up the apartment (“I don’t want our baby to come home to a messy house!”) and packed our bags before heading back to the hospital.</p>
<h2 id="induction-starts-cervidil-1230-am--1230-pm-wednesday">INDUCTION STARTS: Cervidil (˜12:30 am – 12:30 pm, Wednesday)</h2>
<p>The induction process started around 12:30 am with the insertion of a medicine called <a href="https://www.thebump.com/a/cervidil">Cervidil</a> to soften the cervix.</p>
<p>Despite our hopes that things would start to progress rather quickly, Wednesday was a looooooong day. Looking back, I can tell that this was the case because I had time to tweet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019570011952861184 </figure>
<p>Also, I figured that now was as good a time as any to ask for some last-minute parenting advice.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019606474115420160 </figure>
<p>By the way, my friend Ryan Clevenger wins the award for best dad advice given in response to my tweet.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/Nazianzenus/status/1019641823030112261 </figure>
<p>Anyways, the first round of Cervidil lasted 12 hours. After they took the Cervidil out, they checked and Rachel was barely dilated.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they decided to try to insert what is called the Cook Cervical Ripening Balloon, AKA the Cook catheter.</p>
<h2 id="cook-cervical-ripening-balloon-unsuccessful-attempt-1-130-pm-wednesday">Cook Cervical Ripening Balloon, Unsuccessful Attempt #1 (1:30 pm, Wednesday)</h2>
<p>Here’s a picture of what we’re talking about.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cook-Catheter.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>They insert that thing through the cervix, before inflating those balloons on both sides of the cervix.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cook-Catheter-Insertion.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Or, at least, that’s how it’s <em>supposed</em> to go.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they weren’t able to get this thing in on Wednesday afternoon. According to Rachel, it was extremely painful. It was difficult to watch her go through it.</p>
<p>So, after giving her a bit of break, the midwife recommended starting Pitocin.</p>
<h2 id="started-pitocin-400pm-wednesday">Started Pitocin (4:00pm, Wednesday)</h2>
<p>After the unsuccessful insertion of the Cook catheter, they decided to monitor Rachel to see if any regular contractions started. No dice.</p>
<p>After talking with our doula, Teri, on the phone, we decided to start Pitocin on Wednesday afternoon. If you’re curious, <a href="https://www.thebump.com/a/pitocin">here’s some more information about Pitocin and what it does.</a></p>
<p>So, they started Pitocin at around 4:00pm on Wednesday. Just like Cervidil, the first round lasted approximately 12 hours.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019780168326565889 </figure>
<h3 id="to-eat-or-not-to-eat">To Eat, or Not to Eat</h3>
<p>Apparently, normal hospital protocol is that you’re only allowed to consume clear liquids while on Pitocin. We’d heard from various people that this was a load of crap. However, the midwife who was there when we started Pitocin still said “clear liquids only.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we still snuck Rachel snacks when nurses weren’t in the room!</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, we met with a different midwife to discuss how things were progressing. She said “You’re eating, right?,” and then we told her about our clear liquid instructions.</p>
<p>“No no no, you (looks at me) go get her some dinner, OK?”</p>
<p>Best. midwife. ever. I went and got Rachel some Pad Thai.</p>
<p>We also discussed with the midwife what would happen if things didn’t progress at all over night. She said that, if NOTHING had changed in the morning, that they would consider another consult with maternal and fetal medicine doctors to see if we could be sent home for 24 hours before returning to re-start the induction process.</p>
<p>However, she said, if things had moved along enough to allow for the insertion of the Cook catheter, then we would proceed until the baby arrived.</p>
<h2 id="off-pitocin-530-am-thursday">Off Pitocin (5:30 am, Thursday)</h2>
<p>At around 5:30 am, Rachel came off her first round of Pitocin. They checked, and she was only dilated to 1cm. This was kind of a bummer. 29 hours after induction began, with only a measly centimeter to show for it!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this was still progress. So, the next thing we decided to try was the insertion of the Cook catheter again.</p>
<p>Before doing so, Rachel got another break, during which she drank some coffee, ate breakfast, took a shower, etc. Honestly, she seemed pretty chipper at this point. Which was good, because things were about to get going!</p>
<h2 id="labor-starts-cook-catheter-successful-attempt-2-830-am-thursday">LABOR STARTS: Cook Catheter, Successful Attempt #2 (8:30 am, Thursday)</h2>
<p>Thankfully, the second time was a charm. They were able to successfully insert the Cook catheter on Thursday morning at 8:30. (Although, it took another three tries. According to Rachel, the first two were quite painful but the third, when it was successfully in place, didn’t feel that bad.)</p>
<p>After this, however, Rachel started feeling worse/bad and contractions started to pick up. From my perspective, the difference between Rachel at 8:00am and Rachel at 10:00am was enormous.</p>
<p>Looking back, we’d say that labor started around this time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what also started around this time was <em>vomiting</em> (Rachel, not me). I wrote down the first times: 0912, 0945, 1050, 1121, 1215, 1430, 1605… Then, in my notebook, I just have “… (more times).” It was rough.</p>
<h2 id="back-on-pitocin-1030-am-thursday">Back on Pitocin (10:30 am, Thursday)</h2>
<p>Things were progressing, but they didn’t exactly take off after the Cook catheter was in. So, it was back on Pitocin.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019982256037859329 </figure>
<p>Rachel’s contractions were getting more and more painful. Specifically, she was complaining about pain/tension in her lower back.</p>
<p>What’s more, she was getting to the point where she had to stop talking during contractions. This despite her insistence that, while she <em>could</em> talk through the contractions if she really wanted to, it was easier not to talk…</p>
<p>Between that and the vomiting, I suggested that we give our doula a call and ask her to come in.</p>
<h2 id="doula-teri-arrives-100-pm-thursday">Doula Teri Arrives (1:00 pm, Thursday)</h2>
<p>Teri, our doula, arrived at about 1:00 pm on Thursday. Rachel wasn’t doing so hot by then, and I was very glad to have someone else there for more support.</p>
<p>The way things were going, with the back pain and the vomiting, I wasn’t sure how much longer we’d be able to handle things on our own without someone a bit more knowledgeable there to support us.</p>
<h2 id="turning-babies-stressful-nurses-thursday-afternoon">Turning Babies, Stressful Nurses (Thursday Afternoon)</h2>
<p>Thanks be to God that Teri came when she did!</p>
<p>With some coordinated hip movements, she was able to turn the baby around and relieve Rachel’s back pain! Rachel said that it was the weirdest thing ever feeling the baby turn around, and it brought pretty much instant relief.</p>
<p>So, even though her contractions kept getting more intense, they were easier to bear without the pain being concentrated in her lower back.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Thursday afternoon wasn’t all rainbows and butterflies.</p>
<p>For one thing, despite the relief in back pain, contractions were still picking up. At one point, they were about 2.5 minutes apart and pretty intense.</p>
<p>However, we got a new nurse at this point, and she really just stressed us out. She meant well, to be sure, but her ways of handling things were quite different than any of the other nurses we had throughout the process.</p>
<p>Whenever she would come into the room, which she did rather frequently, Rachel’s contractions would slow down or get erratic. This made the nurse (and the midwife) want to crank up the Pitocin. It wasn’t the greatest afternoon.</p>
<p>However, that nurse eventually left. Also, Rachel was able to get a decent nap in… THROUGH some pretty intense contractions! (Teri and I were pretty surprised, looking at the monitor, watching the contractions come, without a peep or change in facial expression from Rachel as she slept.)</p>
<h2 id="removed-cook-catheter-800pm-thursday">Removed Cook Catheter (8:00pm, Thursday)</h2>
<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter">https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1020115308634361857 </figure>
<p>There’s something about 12 hour rounds of things during induction/labor. So, at 8:00pm or so, they took out the Cook catheter.</p>
<p>After a pretty intense afternoon, Rachel was dilated to (*drumroll*) … 3cm!</p>
<p>43.5 hours for 3 centimeters. Sure, progress. But SLOW!</p>
<p>The midwife recommended breaking the bag of waters to move things along. After being reassured that this wouldn’t put us “on a clock” before they would intervene with a C-section, we decided to go ahead with that plan.</p>
<h2 id="broke-bag-of-waters-transferred-to-labor-and-delivery-room-850-pm-thursday">Broke Bag of Waters, Transferred to Labor and Delivery Room (8:50 pm, Thursday)</h2>
<p>Let me tell you, I didn’t realize how quickly they would get equipment ready and break the bag of waters!</p>
<p>We made the call to break the bag. I stepped into the restroom to pee, and by the time I got back out they were right in the middle of the procedure there on the bed!</p>
<p>Thankfully, after this, they moved us to an actual labor and delivery room down the hall. We hoped that things would start to pick up, which was the goal of breaking the bag of waters, after all…</p>
<h2 id="slow-down-900-pm-thursday--1200-am-friday">Slow Down (9:00 pm, Thursday – 12:00 am, Friday)</h2>
<p>However, things slowed back down. This did allow Rachel to take a shower and sleep for another hour or so, but it was concerning that we appeared to be moving backward.</p>
<p>As Rachel slept for a while, Teri sat in the recliner in the corner and I laid down on the couch.</p>
<p>I couldn’t sleep at all. I was watching her contractions get slower and slower on the monitor and wondering how much longer this process was going to go on for. I mean, sure, Rachel is a BOSS. But everyone has their limits. How much longer of an induction/labor process would she be able to take?</p>
<p>After she got some rest, we got Rachel up and moving around. Her and I took a couple laps around the Labor and Delivery unit.</p>
<h2 id="pick-back-up-1200--230-am-friday">Pick Back Up (12:00 – 2:30 am, Friday)</h2>
<p>Thankfully, the movement and changing positions got things going again.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t remember too much about this period. I was purposefully just trying to stay awake and not pay too much attention to the clock.</p>
<p>At one point, however, after trying out various positions, we got Rachel into a good groove of contractions while she sat upright, cross-legged, in the bed—like some sort of pregnant zen master!</p>
<p>At 2:30am, they checked Rachel again. She was dilated to (*tired drumroll*) … 5cm.</p>
<p>My heart kind of sank at this point, because I didn’t know whether to expect things to really get moving, or to expect that we would spend all day/night Friday in labor.</p>
<h2 id="three-hours-in-hell-230--530-am-friday">Three Hours in Hell (2:30 – 5:30 am, Friday)</h2>
<p>Thankfully, things really started to move along.</p>
<p>Granted, I say “thankfully,” but this was really the most intense three hours of the whole process.</p>
<p>The midwife who was on at that point was willing to allow Rachel to labor for awhile in the tub, which she was looking forward to.</p>
<p>However, because Rachel was on Pitocin, she was on continuous fetal monitoring… these two sensors they put around her stomach, to measure contractions and the baby’s heart rate.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t doubt that these monitors can prove incredibly helpful. But they can also be really freaking annoying. It is so easy to lose the baby’s heart rate whenever the mom moves. Then a nurse has to come back in and readjust the monitor until they find the heart rate again. But then mom or baby moves like two minutes later and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p>So, before they were going to let Rachel get in the tub, they wanted her to lie down on her back in the bed so that they could get a good 30 minutes of the baby’s heart rate on the monitor to make sure things were OK.</p>
<p>Rachel was not happy about this because lying on her back was the least comfortable position for her to be in. However, she endured, and made it to the tub.</p>
<p>The tub is where, eventually, Rachel got to “transition” or “transitional labor.” <a href="https://www.thebump.com/a/transitional-labor">You can read more about it here</a>. Suffice it to say that it’s usually the most intense part of labor.</p>
<p>Things were a blur by this point: Tub. Toilet. Tub. Bed. Birthing Ball. Tub. Vomit/retching.</p>
<p>At one point, between the hunger, exhaustion, the deep breathing I was doing with Rachel during her contractions, and kneeling beside the tub holding the puke bucket as she vomited…I began to get nauseous myself!</p>
<p>I asked Teri to go grab me a ginger ale, and I snuck swigs of ginger all and bites of a Clif Bar between Rachel’s contractions in the tub.</p>
<p>Again, at this point, I was purposefully trying not to pay attention to the clock. Sure, things seemed to be moving along now. I’d read in the books that when the mom said “I can’t do this anymore,” that usually meant they were in transition, which meant they were about ready to push…</p>
<p>But, at 2:30 am Rachel had only been at 5 centimeters. So, it didn’t seem wise to get my hopes up. And yet, here my wife was, throwing up over the side of the tub during contractions and saying she didn’t know how much longer she could do this for.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 5:15–5:30, the midwife and her student came in and checked Rachel again, because she was complaining of increased pressure down low.</p>
<p>At this point, I was praying that she was at least 8cm dilated. If not, based on how intense things had just gotten, I wasn’t sure how much longer Rachel would make it without, at the very least, some nitrous gas for pain management.</p>
<p>However, thanks be to God, she was dilated to…9.5cm!</p>
<h2 id="but-i-have-to-push-530546-am-friday">“BUT I HAVE TO PUSH!” (5:30–5:46 am, Friday)</h2>
<p>Now, if you’re in the know, you realize that 9.5cm doesn’t quite cut it. 10cm is the magic dilation number.</p>
<p>SO, although I personally took the 9.5cm news as a comforting blessing and relief from the Lord, for Rachel things got more intense for a bit.</p>
<p>As it’s been described to me, every fiber of her being was urging her to push that baby out, but I and everyone else in the room were urging her NOT to push until she reached full (10cm) dilation.</p>
<p>I was feeling: “YES! Thank God! We’re almost there! We don’t have to endure another full day of labor!!”</p>
<p>They turned the lights up in the room as more people entered to get things ready for delivery. Teri and I focused on keeping Rachel from pushing for as long as we could.</p>
<p>Eventually, the midwife went to check Rachel’s dilation again, and said: “Aaaand, the baby’s head is already through the cervix!”</p>
<p>Rachel: “DOES THAT MEAN I CAN PUSH?!”</p>
<p>Midwife: “Yep! You can push!”</p>
<p>Rachel only ended up pushing for 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>Now, I usually don’t do well with blood, etc., but for some reason I was perfectly fine watching the whole thing as our daughter came out. It was wild. It took awhile to see her head coming, but then, boom!, she was all the way out and screaming!</p>
<h2 id="baby-arrives-eva-joy-steele-was-born-at-546-am-on-friday-july-20-2018">BABY ARRIVES: Eva Joy Steele was born at 5:46 am on Friday, July 20, 2018.</h2>
<p>She weighed 5lbs 8oz, she was 18 inches long, and she has been worth every minute of that lengthy labor and delivery!</p>
<p>Looking back, apart from the initial frustration about getting induced at 37 weeks, we felt very well cared for by the midwives and nurses at Elmhurst. We didn’t feel pressured into moving things along quicker than we felt comfortable with, and we’re very thankful for the medical care that Rachel and Eva received.</p>
<p>Also, we’re incredibly grateful to our doula, Teri, for her support along the way. Even if the only thing she had done was to turn the baby around, that would have been enough! But she went above and beyond throughout the rest of the process, and we’re very thankful she was there with us.</p>
<p>For me, after going through this with my wife, I’m even more impressed by what a strong woman she is. I already knew that she had grit, but making through such a long process without any kind of pain medication was nothing short of amazing.</p>

<p>With Rachel and Eva, I think we’ve got a pretty great team.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kevin J. Vanhoozer, affectionately known by some as “KJV,” has written &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/08/letter-to-an-aspiring-theologian&#34;&gt;one of the best, briefest overviews of what theologians (should) do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire piece is filled with gems like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become a theologian, you must be willing to bear true witness and call out false witnesses, casting down idols and ideologies. That’s the shadow side of theology, but the best part is speaking light and truth in astonished indications of God’s goodness. I love John Webster’s definition of theology: “that delightful activity in which the Church praises God by ordering its thinking towards the gospel of Christ.” Being a theologian means getting to have not necessarily the last word, but the word about last things, “the end for which God created the world” (to cite the title of a dissertation by Jonathan Edwards). It’s not only a good word but the best of all possible words, namely, that God glorifies humans and all creation, magnifying his own glory and subjecting all things to the Lordship of Christ, so that “God may be all in all” (1 Cor. 15:28). It’s the privilege of the theologian to bear witness to the length, depth, breadth, and width of the cross and Resurrection. Karl Barth is right: “The theologian who has no joy in his work is not a theologian at all.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Attracts People to Anglicanism? Here&#39;s My Take</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based upon my work over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/&#34;&gt;Rookie Anglican&lt;/a&gt;, I was asked by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teloscollective.com/&#34;&gt;The Telos Collective&lt;/a&gt; to write a blog post about the different ways that people are coming into Anglicanism. What’s drawing them in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teloscollective.com/what-attracts-people-to-anglicanism-subversive-cultural-resonance/&#34;&gt;read my full post over at the Telos Collective blog&lt;/a&gt;, but here’s a taste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based upon my work over at <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">Rookie Anglican</a>, I was asked by <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com/">The Telos Collective</a> to write a blog post about the different ways that people are coming into Anglicanism. What’s drawing them in?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com/what-attracts-people-to-anglicanism-subversive-cultural-resonance/">read my full post over at the Telos Collective blog</a>, but here’s a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).</p>
<p>No “culture of this world” can be equated with the culture of Jesus Christ. This is, I suggest, the important sense in which Christians (and not just Anglican ones) should not be “seeker-sensitive.”</p>
<p>And yet, on the other hand, the very mission of the church seems to demand that Christians be “seeker-sensitive” in the best sense of the phrase. This is because the gospel, though it does contain a powerful critique of a world alienated from God, is only “good news” to the extent that it resonates with (and does not merely refute) the cultures in which it is proclaimed.</p>
<p>So, perhaps we Anglicans need to do a better job of being “seeker-sensitive”—in the sense of resonating with the culture(s).</p>
<p>“Resonating” with the culture, however, does not necessarily mean “approving.” Instead, the church’s resonance with the cultures around it will frequently be “subversive” (again, see Scot McKnight’s previous piece).</p>
<p>Toward that end, I’d like to consider some ways in which I’ve noticed the Anglican tradition subversively resonating with the culture(s) around it—especially those in the United States of America in recent years.</p>

      <title>Two More Pieces about Jordan Peterson</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/two-more-pieces-about-jordan-peterson/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 19:08:55 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/two-more-pieces-about-jordan-peterson/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/what-to-make-of-jordan-peterson-some-takes-then-my-own/&#34;&gt;I catalogued a bunch of different takes on Jordan Peterson, before giving my own take&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that post, two other pieces about Jordan Peterson have been written that I’d like to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;jordan-peterson-custodian-of-the-patriarchy-by-nellie-bowles-new-york-times&#34;&gt;“Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy,” by Nellie Bowles (New York Times)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html&#34;&gt;Nellie Bowles writes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Since that post, two other pieces about Jordan Peterson have been written that I’d like to share.</p>
<h1 id="jordan-peterson-custodian-of-the-patriarchy-by-nellie-bowles-new-york-times">“Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy,” by Nellie Bowles (New York Times)</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html">Nellie Bowles writes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the piece, she continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He was angry at God because women were rejecting him,” Mr. Peterson says of the Toronto killer. “The cure for that is enforced monogamy. That’s actually why monogamy emerges.”</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson does not pause when he says this. Enforced monogamy is, to him, simply a rational solution. Otherwise women will all only go for the most high-status men, he explains, and that couldn’t make either gender happy in the end.</p>
<p>“Half the men fail,” he says, meaning that they don’t procreate. “And no one cares about the men who fail.”</p>
<p>I laugh, because it is absurd.</p>
<p>“You’re laughing about them,” he says, giving me a disappointed look. “That’s because you’re female.”</p>
<p>But aside from interventions that would redistribute sex, Mr. Peterson is staunchly against what he calls “equality of outcomes,” or efforts to equalize society. He usually calls them pathological or evil.</p>
<p>He agrees that this is inconsistent. But preventing hordes of single men from violence, he believes, is necessary for the stability of society. Enforced monogamy helps neutralize that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, here is a perfect example of how easy it is to misunderstand Peterson. When he says “enforced monogamy,” he’s using a technical anthropological term, one that has to do with social norms, and not enforcing monogamy by assigning sexual partners through the use of state (or other) power/violence.</p>
<p><a href="https://jordanbpeterson.com/media/on-the-new-york-times-and-enforced-monogamy/">Peterson himself has attempted to clarify this since the NYT piece</a>, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, let’s summarize. Men get frustrated when they are not competitive in the sexual marketplace (note: the fact that they DO get frustrated does not mean that they SHOULD get frustrated. Pointing out the existence of something is not the same as justifying its existence). Frustrated men tend to become dangerous, particularly if they are young. The dangerousness of frustrated young men (even if that frustration stems from their own incompetence) has to be regulated socially. The manifold social conventions tilting most societies toward monogamy constitute such regulation.</p>
<p>That’s all.</p>
<p>No recommendation of police-state assignation of woman to man (or, for that matter, man to woman).</p>
<p>No arbitrary dealing out of damsels to incels.</p>
<p>Nothing scandalous (all innuendo and suggestive editing to the contrary)</p>
<p>Just the plain, bare, common-sense facts: socially-enforced monogamous conventions decrease male violence. In addition (and not trivially) they also help provide mothers with comparatively reliable male partners, and increase the probability that stable, father-intact homes will exist for children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, of course, you can still disagree with Peterson’s take here. However, it seems unfair to make it sound like he thinks women should be assigned to men against their wishes.</p>
<h1 id="the-shocking-truth-about-jordan-peterson-by-wesley-yang-tablet">“The Shocking Truth About Jordan Peterson,” by Wesley Yang (Tablet)</h1>
<p>This piece by Wesley Yang is currently my favorite take on Jordan Peterson, because it offers such a nuanced critique.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/262280/jordan-peterson">Wesley Yang writes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is something uneasily poised at the border of grandiosity and grandeur, heroism and quixotism, about Peterson that makes him appealing to undergraduates at the same time as it makes him a target-rich environment for haughty intellectuals and snarky journalists. There are literally tens of thousands of graduate students and ex-graduate students who know more about the intricacies of postmodern thought than Jordan Peterson does. Peterson’s tweeted and blogged responses to the Times piece are indicative of a person with virtually no sense of how he will be regarded by those who do not share his private system of reference. Why don’t you recognize that I’m not speaking of actual men and women but the symbolic Masculine and Feminine in Jungian archetypal thinking? Why don’t you know that “Enforced Monogamy” is an anthropological term? You won’t understand anything about Jordan Peterson until you realize that his confusion on these questions is entirely sincere.</p>
<p>So what does Peterson actually believe? He has consistently defended the moral position that the “individual is sovereign over the group,” a unique feature of Anglo-American political theory and practice that holds that citizens hold their rights against the state rather than through it, which is inscribed into our founding documents, and helps to account for the remarkable capacity of societies built around its doctrines to accommodate high levels of diversity while remaining democratic. The underlying sovereignty of individuals forces state power to operate against a hard constraint that limits coercion, and gives individuals the means by which to push back.</p>
<p>This position is not a “centrist” position between the poles of alt-right and the identity politics of the left, but a distinct position orthogonal to both. It rejects group identity as the foundation of politics in favor of strengthening the individual as a bulwark against what Peterson calls “ideological possession”—the temptation to subordinate the various ends of life into a contest for group dominance. Peterson sees the emergence of identity politics on both the right and left as a single phenomenon, with each pole feeding the growth of the other, as individuals lost amidst the chaos of contemporary life turn to ideologies providing simple solutions to complex questions, a corresponding set of friends—and a corresponding set of enemies. How anyone who has spent a single afternoon on Twitter can doubt that these polarizing group psychological dynamics exist—and explain the growth of political extremism at a time of relative prosperity—is frankly perplexing to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, on the one hand, Peterson should be held responsible for some of his rhetoric, and he should take a bit more care to ensure that he’s being correctly understood by his various audiences. On the other hand, Peterson’s views are quite MODERATE. He is not the radical right-wing ideologue that many people make him out to be.</p>

&lt;p&gt;It took me a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to “fall in love” with running. It did not take me nearly as long to fall &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of love with running!&lt;/p&gt;

<h1 id="rucking-gt-running">Rucking &gt; Running</h1>
<p>It took me a <em>long</em> time to “fall in love” with running. It did not take me nearly as long to fall <em>out</em> of love with running!</p>
<p>And yet, even though I’ve long enjoyed <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/kettlebell-swings-back-balm-for-the-sedentary-seminarian/">doing kettlebell swings</a> and doing <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">the 5×5 weight-lifing workout</a>, I did begin to miss the benefits of cardio training.</p>
<p>Enter <em>rucking</em>.</p>
<p>I first heard about <em>rucking</em>—carrying a weighted pack on your back—as a form of personal fitness over at <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-benefits-of-rucking/">The Art of Manliness</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rucking is simple. So simple, it’s stupid.<br>
Get a backpack.<br>
Put some weight in said backpack.<br>
Put on the backpack.<br>
Start walking.<br>
That’s it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="want-to-get-started-heres-how-to-ruck-on-a-budget">Want to Get Started? Here’s How to Ruck on a Budget</h1>
<p>To get started with rucking, I first used my old backpack and a couple dumbbells. This worked fine, but I didn’t like how the dumbbells dug into my lower back.</p>
<p>So, I did some research about rucking on a budget, and I found <a href="http://www.mettleforger.com/how-to-ruck-on-a-budget/">this very helpful blogpost: “How to: Ruck on a Budget.”</a> There’s also <a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/a-guide-to-rucking-my-favorite-low-cost-frugal-exercise-activity/">this piece at The Simple Dollar: A Guide to Rucking, My Favorite Low-Cost Exercise Activity.</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, I picked different gear. Here’s my current rucking setup:</p>
<h2 id="backpack-la-police-gear-3-day-backpack-20">Backpack: LA Police Gear 3 Day Backpack 2.0</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_4031.jpg" alt="IMG 4031"  title="IMG_4031.JPG"  />

</p>
<p>This backpack has held up great for me so far. I use it regularly for rucking, and also <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/dangerous-beauty-phoenix-grand-canyon-trip-2018/">took it with me out to the Grand Canyon, where it performed admirably</a>. I love that it includes a waist and chest strap, as well as a convenient opening for a hydration pack.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://lapolicegear.com/diplomat-3-day-backpack1.html">buy this pack from LA Police Gear directly</a>, or <a href="https://amzn.to/2JsKE2C">it’s also available on Amazon</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>I sweat a <em>lot</em>, so I figured that it would be nice to have a reliable hydration pack to take with me while rucking.</p>
<p>So far, this 2-liter hydration pack from Source has NOT disappointed me!</p>

<p>I believe that the bricks I currently use came from Home Depot. I could be mistaken, but I think that I have 6 of <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Holland-7-75-in-x-4-in-x-1-75-in-River-Red-Concrete-Paver-22051EA/100619492">these Holland 7.75 in. x 4 in. x 1.75 in. River Red Concrete Paver</a> bricks. Currently, they’re listed for $0.58 each.</p>
<p>As for duct tape, I’m pretty sure I used good ol’ fashioned Duck Brand duct tape.</p>

<p>I also used some <a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/office/bubble-wrap/1229749_2696828_1478303_5636662">bubble wrap that I picked up at Walmart</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t think this is necessary, but I went out and bought <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/YOGA-BLOCK-BLUE/54193774">two foam yoga blocks/bricks from Walmart</a> in order to position the bricks a bit higher in the backpack.</p>
<p>You could also go with these from Amazon. Just make sure that the yoga blocks are big enough to support the stack of bricks you end up using (or whatever other weights you end up using).</p>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I defend the proposal for my dissertation. For now, the dissertation is tentatively titled: “Scriptural, but Not Religious: Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the “elevator pitch” for the dissertation. Feedback appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, I defend the proposal for my dissertation. For now, the dissertation is tentatively titled: “Scriptural, but Not Religious: Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion.”</p>
<p>Here’s the “elevator pitch” for the dissertation. Feedback appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="scriptural-but-not-religious-barth-bonhoeffer-and-a-biblical-critique-of-religion">Scriptural, but Not Religious: Barth, Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion</h2>
<p>My project traces its origins to a single classroom discussion question in the Spring of 2015. The question was this: “In what ways is Bonhoeffer’s understanding of religion similar to, and different from, that of Barth?”</p>
<p>Although we only spent a few minutes on that question in class, it’s been on my mind ever since.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s the reason I’m defending this dissertation proposal today — not because I’ve found the perfect answer to the question, but rather because I think I’ve found a better way to approach the question.</p>
<p>You see, every discussion of the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship that I’ve read eventually gets around to discussing the similarities and differences between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s critical understandings of religion. And rightly so, because this is the most confusing aspect of their relationship to explain.</p>
<p>Why does Bonhoeffer in prison, after adopting Barth’s theological critique of religion as idolatrous unbelief…<br>
Why does Bonhoeffer, after claiming that the critique of religion was Barth’s greatest merit and original contribution as a theologian…<br>
Why does Bonhoeffer say that Barth left us with nothing more than a “positivism of revelation” — a flattening of doctrines to the same relative importance, as a result of which the world is left to its own devices — whatever that means!<br>
Why does Bonhoeffer then speak approvingly of a “religionless Christianity,” something that Barth explicitly refused to support?</p>
<p>This is the central mystery, as it were, of the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship.</p>
<p>So far, scholars have attempted to solve it either by (1) proposing theological frameworks to explain Barth and Bonhoeffer’s differences, or by (2) proposing explanations of just what Bonhoeffer meant by the “positivism of revelation.”</p>
<p>I do not mean to discount the work that’s been done already in these two areas. However, instead of proposing a theological framework or an explanation of “positivism of revelation,” I want to examine the connection between these two theologians’ critiques of religion and their use of Scripture.</p>
<p>Why? Because, despite John Webster’s suggestion about 18 years ago that examining each theologian’s use of Scripture would be a helpful way forward in explaining their relationship, no one has devoted lengthy attention to the relationship between Barth and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion and their interpretations of particular biblical passages.</p>
<p>This is what I would like to do. This will be my original contribution to scholarship.</p>
<p>If given permission, I will examine the connections between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological interpretations of particular biblical texts and their theological critiques of religion.</p>
<p>I believe that doing so will help us understand the historical and conceptual relationships between these two theologians. It will also inform a biblical critique of religion for the church’s use today.</p>

<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400introductionspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three or so decisions you make each day about what to eat are some of the most consequential choices you make in your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author Wendell Berry notes that, “eating is an agricultural act.” That is, eating is more than just the satisfaction of appetite. Our plates are food’s final destination in a long supply chain that runs </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">through a restaurant or grocery store, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">through food packing facilities, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">guided by the hands of food workers, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">often over thousands of miles via truck and train, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">through commodity processing facilities, </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">all the way back to a farm. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This backstory is both daunting and empowering, because the food choices we make – what we eat, and who we buy it from – send economic signals through all corners of this supply chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a part of a broken world, contemporary food production it is filled with injustice and often creates suffering. But, it does not have to be that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bible clearly calls Christians to work towards a just future, to work with the grain of the gospel, as it were, by participating in the redemptive work that God is doing in the world. One of the most needed areas for this redemption is the modern food system. </span></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400factory-farmingspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factory Farming</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most consumers assume that their meat comes from farms where animals graze and wander around green, pastoral landscapes. That could not be further from the truth. </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400animal-sufferingspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animal Suffering</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://farmforward.com/ending-factory-farming/#easy-footnote-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vast majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (&gt;99%) of the more than 10 billion chickens, turkeys, pigs, and cows slaughtered each year in the US for meat are raised on factory farms, industrial facilities often referred to as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built to maximize efficiency and profits, these farms are hell on earth for their inhabitants. Animals are </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cafo+pictures&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGqOXlv6DYAhUL5oMKHUF2AogQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=835"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overcrowded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prevented from moving freely or performing natural behaviors. Many never see sunlight or grass at any point in their lives, and are fed unnatural diets of subsidized feed crops such as corn and soybeans — enduring </span><a href="https://www.mercyforanimals.org/the-problem"><span style="font-weight: 400;">miserable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lives that are cut short by slaughter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that they reach slaughter weight quickly, chickens have been bred to feel constant hunger and eat constantly. Breeds that used to take 6 months to reach full size now regularly attain that weight in one month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put that growth in perspective, imagine a human baby reaching full physical maturity at</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">age 3, instead of taking 18 years. As a consequence of this rapid growth, many chickens have an insufficient skeletal structure and are frequently crippled by bones that break under the stress of their unnaturally large weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this cruelty would be illegal if done to companion animals like dogs or horses, but it is regularly inflicted on billions of animals who have similar levels of intelligence and emotional complexity without a second thought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cows, pigs, chickens, and other animals experience a wide range of emotions, including curiosity, pleasure, pain, fear, joy, anger, sadness, playfulness and more. They most certainly have the capacity to suffer, and suffer they do, innumerable animals in unimaginable conditions. </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400environmental-costsspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, animal agriculture comes with a hefty environmental price tag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meat production is </span><a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/studies-link-red-meat-and-climate-change-20264"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resource-intensive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Producing one pound of feedlot beef takes an average of 2,500 gallons of water, 12 pounds of grain, 35 pounds of topsoil and one gallon of gasoline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation </span><a href="http://www.fao.org/animal-production/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that almost 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the planet’s total agricultural land is used for feeding or processing meat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, animal agriculture </span><a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emits more greenhouse gases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the entire transportation system – all cars, trains, planes and ships – and is responsible for more emissions than any other economic sector.</span></p>
<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-grain-of-the-gospel-eden-shalom-and-the-world-to-comespan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grain of the Gospel: Eden, Shalom, and the World to Come</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current food system bears all the markings of a broken system, and is surely not what Christians should envision for a redeemed world. The gospel message is that creation was made good, it belongs to God, it is in a broken state, but God is at work redeeming the world and bringing about its complete reconciliation.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-created-worldspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Created World</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the original created order of Eden, all creatures lived peacefully in community, and God told humans to consume only plant-based foods:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then God said, ‘I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.’ And it was so.” (Genesis 1.29–31) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animals were not created to be food for humans or for each other, but to be companions:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Lord God said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.’ Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. [God] brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals” (Genesis 2.19-20)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this context, the God-given “dominion” over animals implies a parent-child relationship, not a hunter-hunted dynamic. As </span><a href="https://www.petalambs.com/scripture-and-testimonies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this piece from PETA LAMBS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts it:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“God created humans in God’s image and according to God’s likeness and told humans to steward this new creation. And what is God’s likeness? Throughout the Scripture, God shows us mercy that we do not deserve, grace that we have not earned, and love that we cannot imagine. We are made in that likeness and are charged with reflecting those qualities to the whole of creation. Being made in the image of God is a call to caretaking, compassion, and mercy.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eden was a herbivorous world, filled with animals that were created to be companions with humans. Eating meat begins after human pride and greed allow brokenness into the world. </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-fallen-worldspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fallen World</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the new human-created order, Creation has been marred, good things have been repurposed for evil, blood is being shed, and instead of living in a peaceful community of God’s original design, humans are now violent toward animals and each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can choose to live either </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">against</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the grain of the gospel. Every time we eat meat, we necessarily participate in this fallen order and comply with the imperfections of this world. But, when we avoid killing other creatures, our efforts are directed away from brokenness and towards reversing the curse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Fall is a part of our present reality, Christians are called to work towards reversing its effects, not accentuating them. The Fall is the way the world is, but Eden and Heaven are the way it should be, and it seems good for Christians to participate in building the fully redeemed world to come rather than deepening the effects of the Fall.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylefont-weight-400the-future-worldspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Future World</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prophecies such as Isaiah 11.6–9 seem to foresee a return to this vegetarian world: </span></p>
<p>The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat,<br>
</span>and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together;<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and a little child shall lead them.<br>
</span>The cow and the bear shall graze;<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> their young shall lie down together;<br>
</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.<br>
</span>The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra,<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den.<br>
</span>They shall not hurt or destroy<br>
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> in all my holy mountain;<br>
</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord<br>
</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> as the waters cover the sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The redeemed world to come, the kingdom that God is building on earth, is an herbivorous kingdom, free from death and suffering. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God declares ownership of animals ( Psalm 50.10) </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God will protect all creatures (Isaiah 7.18-25), and they will all worship their Creator (Isaiah 43.20)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Righteous people are mindful of the needs of animals (Proverbs 12:10)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God makes a covenant with animals (Hosea 2.18)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God did not necessarily desire animal sacrifices (Isaiah 1.11)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murder of an ox or a human are both described as wrong (Isaiah 66.3)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">God seems concerned for the welfare of both animals and people (Jonah 4.11)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, reconciled world, the wolf will lie down with the lamb, and a child will lead them. Hurt and destruction will pass away, and the lion will eat straw like the ox (Isaiah 11.3-9 and 65.25)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-this-a-valid-theological-argument">Is this a valid theological argument?</h2>
<p><strong>It is important to note that Christians should not always operate on the basis of the world to come in the midst of the world as it is.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There will not be marriage in the world to come (Matt. 22.30), nor will people teach each other about God (Jer. 31:34), but these are both acceptable things to do in the present age. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why should eating meat be any different?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their roots going back beyond the Fall to God’s good creation, marriage and teaching about God are good things to do in the present, but will become unnecessary in the world to come. Eating meat, on the other hand, cannot be traced back beyond the Fall. It is an unneeded, negative act in the present and will be impossible in a fully redeemed world. We do not have the license to act violently in the present world just because the future perfect world is not yet fully realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we eat meat-free diets, we are participating in the redemptive work that God is doing in the world, actualizing a future where humans and animals will live in community as nonviolent companions. </span><a href="https://www.thebanner.org/features/2018/02/eating-toward-shalom-why-food-ethics-matters-for-the-21st-century-church"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew C. Halteman summarizes it well</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Caring for animals was the very first responsibility bestowed to humankind by God—our very first chance to practice the capacities of love, power, and mercy that accompany the divine image within us…Someone seeking to eat mindfully aspires to live toward the biblical ideal of shalom—the peaceful state of holistic flourishing that is portrayed first in Eden and last on the holy mountain of the prophet Isaiah’s vision of a fully redeemed world.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h1 id="span-stylefont-weight-400conclusionspan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing meat consumption has many benefits:</span></p>
<ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>UPDATE: Read my post, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/two-more-pieces-about-jordan-peterson/">“Two More Pieces about Jordan Peterson.”</a></em></p>
<p>If I remember correctly, I first heard of and listened to Jordan Peterson on <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/08/31/podcast-335-using-power-myths-live-flourishing-life/">an episode of The Art of Manliness podcast</a>. (Or perhaps it was <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2018/02/06/12-rules-for-life-jordan-peterson-interview/">this episode</a>.)</p>
<h1 id="however-i-could-be-mistaken-because-petersons-been-popping-up-in-conversation-all-over-the-place-in-my-circles">However, I could be mistaken, because Peterson’s been popping up in conversation all over the place in my circles.</h1>
<p>Blog posts, podcast episodes, conversations with friends – Peterson has been popping up everywhere, so it seems.</p>
<h2 id="gerald-mcdermotts-take">Gerald McDermott’s Take</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/northamptonseminar/2018/02/03/biblical-wisdom-secular-psychologist/">old seminary professor, Gerald McDermott</a>, has blogged about Peterson’s new book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522244418&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=12+rules+for+life&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=joshuapsteele-20&amp;linkId=3dbfc723801c4d44e8f654a5e7da752c">12 Rules for Life: an Antidote to Chaos</a>,” saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a good book, blunt and inspiring.</p>
<p>We live in a time when so many young (and not so young) people feel lost, unsure of how they should approach their lives, or life in general. Mr. Peterson talks about the attitudes that will help find the path. It is not a politically correct or officially approved path, but it is an intensely practical and yet heightened one: This life you’re living has meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="scot-mcknights-blogs-patrick-mitchells-take">Scot McKnight’s Blog’s (Patrick Mitchell’s) Take</h2>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/01/29/jordan-petersons-12-rules/">Scot McKnight blogged (or rather, published a guest post by Patrick Mitchell) about Peterson’s 12 Rules</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is he saying?</p>
<p>This is a big question because, as he says himself, he talks a lot, often too much and often at speed. He also covers a lot of ground from psychology, to philosophy, to men and women, to the Bible, to politics, to the world of work and freedom of speech. What follows is a snap-shot, drawn from listening to Peterson over the last year.</p>
<p>And the fact that what he is saying is now seen as ‘provocative’ or ‘radical’ or ‘patriarchal’ or ‘extreme’ says more about a contemporary culture of relativism and victimhood than it does about Peterson. Finding out more about his ‘reputation’, I have had to keep asking myself, ‘am I missing something?’. ‘Is this guy a member of some secret right-wing network?’ For I can’t see the evidence in his academic lectures, written material or YouTube videos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the post is <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/01/29/jordan-petersons-12-rules/">a pretty detailed look at various aspects of Peterson’s thought</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-infamous-channel-4-interview">The Infamous Channel 4 Interview</h2>
<p>Both of those blogs mention Peterson’s now infamous Channel 4 interview where Cathy Newman adopts some pretty aggressive and apparently unfair interviewing tactics (listen for “so you’re saying…,” followed by caricatures of Peterson’s claims):</p>

<hr>
<h1 id="other-takes-on-peterson">Other Takes on Peterson</h1>
<hr>
<p>First, here are a couple explicitly “theological” takes:</p>
<h2 id="first-things-jordan-peterson-unlikely-guru-matthew-schmitz">First Things: “Jordan Peterson, Unlikely Guru” (Matthew Schmitz)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/04/jordan-peterson-unlikely-guru">Schmitz’s entire piece</a> is worth reading, but here was the kicker, in my opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What critics and fans alike miss is just how unlikely a guru Peterson is. Though he brims with sympathy for the confused, he is uncertain about where they should go. He advocates for rules but is vague on who should set them. He believes in the importance of religion, but he doesn’t quite have one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schmitz concludes the piece with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Young men look to Peterson for answers, but he is still turning the kaleidoscope, searching for pattern and form. Earlier this year, an interviewer for VICE asked him, “Who is your target audience, who are you trying to reach?” With eyes downcast he said, “Partly me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="think-theology-peterson-driscoll-and-the-millenial-man-matthew-hosier">Think Theology: “Peterson, Driscoll, and the Millenial Man” (Matthew Hosier)</h2>
<p><a href="http://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/peterson_driscoll_the_millennial_man">Mathew Hosier, at Think Theology, confesses that some of Peterson’s talk of personal responsibility reminds him of Mark Driscoll</a>. Nevertheless, he admits that he thinks Peterson is different than Driscoll:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of what happened at Mars Hill, it is undeniable that Driscoll’s genius was connecting with and motivating young men. They responded in their droves to his yelling at them to take responsibility for themselves and others. He painted a picture of the possible that was more compelling for many Millennials than the needs-based, rights-oriented culture in which they had been raised.</p>
<p>Peterson has observed how his lectures attract a surprisingly large number of young men too. Peterson is a very different character from Driscoll, but his challenge to young men to ‘pick up the heaviest rock you can and carry it’ is strikingly similar. Many Millennial young men seem confused about what it is to be a man and something leaps in them when another man tells them what they can do about it: shoulder a load, take some responsibility, clean your room and make life better for you and for those around you.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Other, less (explicitly) theological takes on Peterson abound:</p>
<h2 id="the-atlantic-why-cant-people-hear-what-jordan-peterson-is-saying-connor-friesdorf">The Atlantic: “Why Can’t People Hear What Jordan Peterson is saying?” (Connor Friesdorf)</h2>
<p>Focusing on the Channel 4 interview, Friesdorf concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…this is neither an endorsement nor a condemnation of Peterson’s views. It is an argument that the effects of the approach used in this interview are pernicious.</p>
<p>For one, those who credulously accept the interviewer’s characterizations will emerge with the impression that a prominent academic holds troubling views that, in fact, he does not actually believe or advocate. Some will feel needlessly troubled. And distorted impressions of what figures like Peterson mean by the words that they speak can only exacerbate overall polarization between their followers and others, and sap their critics of credibility to push back where they are wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="vox-jordan-peterson-explained-zack-beauchamp">Vox: “Jordan Peterson, Explained” (Zack Beauchamp)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144166/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life">Zack Beauchamp has a long write-up on Jordan Peterson in Vox magazine</a>, which concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Peterson has inextricably intertwined his self-help approach with a kind of reactionary politics that validates white, straight, and cisgender men at the expense of everyone else. He gives them a sense of purpose by, in part, tearing other people down — by insisting that the world can and should revolve around them and their problems.</p>
<p>This painful contrast is on display later in that very interview, in which he explicitly argues that concern for sexism is to blame for the plight of the West’s young men.</p>
<p>“We’re so stupid. We’re alienating young men. We’re telling them that they’re patriarchal oppressors and denizens of rape culture,” he says. “It’s awful. It’s so destructive. It’s so unnecessary. And it’s so sad.”</p>
<p>The empathy that he displays for men and boys in his BBC interview and 12 Rules for Life is touching. The problem is that he can’t seem to extend it to anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: From what I know of Peterson, Beauchamp’s take strikes me as unfair. Peterson himself isn’t trying to validate “white, straight, and cisgender men at the expense of everyone else</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-new-york-times-the-jordan-peterson-moment-david-brooks">The New York Times: “The Jordan Peterson Moment” (David Brooks)</h2>
<p>In my opinion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/opinion/jordan-peterson-moment.html">David Brooks hits the nail on the head here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of Peterson’s advice sounds to me like vague exhortatory banality. Like Hobbes and Nietzsche before him, he seems to imagine an overly brutalistic universe, nearly without benevolence, beauty, attachment and love. His recipe for self-improvement is solitary, nonrelational, unemotional. I’d say the lives of young men can be improved more through loving attachment than through Peterson’s joyless and graceless calls to self-sacrifice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I wouldn’t exactly call Peterson’s calls to self-sacrifice “joyless and graceless.”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-new-yorker-jordan-petersons-gospel-of-masculinity-kelefa-sanneh">The New Yorker: “Jordan Peterson’s Gospel of Masculinity” (Kelefa Sanneh)</h2>
<p>Similarly, I think that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/jordan-petersons-gospel-of-masculinity">Kelefa Sanneh hits the nail on the head here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peterson sometimes asks audiences to view him as an alternative to political excesses on both sides. During an interview on BBC Radio 5, he said, “I’ve had thousands of letters from people who were tempted by the blandishments of the radical right, who’ve moved towards the reasonable center as a consequence of watching my videos.” But he typically sees liberals, or leftists, or “postmodernists,” as aggressors—which leads him, rather ironically, to frame some of those on the “radical right” as victims. Many of his political stances are built on this type of inversion. Postmodernists, he says, are obsessed with the idea of oppression, and, by waging war on oppressors real and imagined, they become oppressors themselves. Liberals, he says, are always talking about the importance of compassion—and yet “there’s nothing more horrible for children, and developing people, than an excess of compassion.” (This horror, he says, is embodied in the figure of the “Freudian devouring mother”; as an example, he cites Ursula, the sea witch from “The Little Mermaid.”) The danger, it seems, is that those who want to improve Western society may end up destroying it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, time for some thoughts of my own.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="my-current-take-on-jordan-peterson">My Current Take on Jordan Peterson</h1>
<h2 id="first-hes-definitely-on-to-something">First, he’s definitely on to something.</h2>
<p>There’s no denying it, Jordan Peterson is striking a chord. And, I believe, that’s at least partially due to the fact that he’s RIGHT.</p>
<p>Despite the existence of structural sins and systems of oppression, it simply will not do to blame the world for all of one’s problems. At some point, we must take responsibility for our own lives.</p>
<p>I believe that the Christian doctrine of the imago Dei — of humans being created in the image of God — can theologically underwrite Peterson’s emphasis on responsibility. We humans have been created by God and given stewardship over the earth (see Genesis 1-2). Perhaps, despite the effects of the Fall (see Genesis 3), we have more control over our lives than we might realize.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there’s plenty of content in biblical Wisdom Literature (see Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, especially) to support what Peterson is saying about how to live your life in a way that fights back against the chaos of the world.</p>
<h2 id="and-yet-his-individualism-worries-me">And yet, his individualism worries me.</h2>
<p>Sure, we’re created in the imago Dei, and that means we have control and responsibility for our lives.</p>
<p>And yet, humans are communal creatures. So, if we overemphasize <em>individual</em> responsibility, we might end up underemphasizing the ways in which we are responsible for one another, including — and especially — the oppressed and the outcasts.</p>
<p>Now, Peterson is prone to claim that any talk of systemic oppression these days is due to the Radical Left, but I don’t buy his over-generalizations on that count. The Bible seems to bear witness to the existence of structural sin, and Christians must take systems of oppression into account as they discern how to follow Jesus.</p>
<p>Granted, Peterson isn’t simply saying “it’s every man for himself, forget about the losers.” He’s much more nuanced than that.</p>
<p>But still, I find his views of the world — at least as expressed in 12 Rules for Life — to be more individualistic than the account I see in Christian Scripture.</p>
<h2 id="furthermore-he-seems-to-fall-into-the-very-trap-he-attempts-to-avoid-victimhood">Furthermore, he seems to fall into the very trap he attempts to avoid: victimhood.</h2>
<p>Peterson is trying to provide an alternative, a middle way, to the Radical Left and the Radical Right. However, some of his rhetoric about the Radical Left — justified though it may be in certain circumstances, given what appear to be widespread mischaracterizations of his thought! — sometimes seem to fall into the very trap of “victimhood” that he encourages his audience to avoid.</p>
<p>It goes something like this: Peterson claims that it’s the Radical Left that’s oppressing people — specifically, men — by insisting that people are either oppressors or the oppressed.</p>
<p>Again, Peterson’s not flat-footed or unnuanced about this, but in some of his less-careful moments, he seems to fall into what he’s labeling as the Radical Left’s trap by painting himself and his audience as victims of a Radical Leftist conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Then again, perhaps that’s because Peterson’s been the target of quite a few misinterpretations and attacks. Maybe he gets some grace to have certain less-careful moments, as it were.</p>
<p>And yet, if he’s <em>really</em> going to provide a middle way between Right and Left ideologies, he needs to avoid the victim/oppressed rhetoric consistently.</p>
<h2 id="finally-he-plays-fast-and-loose-with-divine-revelation-and-religious-traditions">Finally, he plays fast and loose with divine revelation and religious traditions.</h2>
<p>I think it’s great that Peterson has respect for religion and religious narratives.</p>
<p>And yet, I think it’s pretty awful that Peterson feels free to float lightly above all religious narratives and basically craft a Petersonian “meta-religion” of his own out of the bits and pieces of religious narratives that he finds most useful and compelling.</p>
<p>Sure, sometimes his theological interpretation of biblical texts seems pretty thought-provoking, excellent, and faithful to the Christian tradition. However, at other times I find myself bracing at the idiosyncrasies of his interpretations — not to mention the ease with which he pulls in building blocks from various traditions to craft his own narrative. It makes me wonder if adherents of other religious traditions would feel a similar unease when their narratives are used in such a construction project.</p>
<p>By respecting all/most religious traditions, Peterson may very well end up respecting no particular religious tradition. As a Christian theologian, I find that troublesome.</p>
<h2 id="hes-worth-reading">He’s worth reading.</h2>
<p>After listening to the book on Audible, I bought myself a physical copy of 12 Rules for Life.</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=joshuapsteele-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=0345816021&asins=0345816021&linkId=798f148b4266de5cd4854d35961356ee&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;"></iframe>
<p>I plan to read the book again and discuss it with friends. It’s currently the top non-fiction book on Amazon for good reason: it’s thought-provoking and it will get you thinking deeper about how to live your life in this world.</p>
<p>Those Amazon links above are affiliate links. It’s a no-extra-cost way to support my writing. If you click the link and buy something, I get a small commission.</p>

<h1 id="do-more-better-an-overview"><em>Do More Better</em>, An Overview</h1>
<h2 id="know-your-purpose">Know Your Purpose</h2>
<p><strong>Chapter one, Know Your Purpose</strong>, is devoted to the maxim that, <strong>as a Christian, your purpose is to glorify God by doing good to others.</strong></p>
<h2 id="answer-the-call">Answer the Call</h2>
<p>In <strong>chapter two, Answer the Call</strong>, Challies discusses the “Producitivity Thieves” of Laziness, Busyness, “BusyLazy,” and Thorns &amp; Thistles. He also places personal productivity in its proper context in the Christian life, rightly stating that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God calls you to productivity, but he calls you to the right kind of productivity. He calls you to be productive for his sake, not your own. While this book will emphasize tools and systems and other important elements of productivity, nothing is more important than your own holiness and your own godliness. No amount of organization and time management will compensate for a lack of Christian character, not when it comes to this great calling of glory through good — bringing glory to God by doing good to others” (25).</p>

<h2 id="define-your-responsibilities">Define Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p>In <strong>chapter three, Define Your Responsibilities</strong>, Challies walks us through the process of defining and listing the various <strong>areas of responsibility</strong> in our lives (Personal, Family, Church, School, Work, Social, etc.), as well as our <strong>roles</strong> within those various areas of responsibility. Defining and listing both of these things provides the map/framework for what follows.</p>
<h2 id="state-your-mission">State Your Mission</h2>
<p>In <strong>chapter four, State Your Mission</strong>, Challies covers the process of developing mission/purpose statements for each of the Areas of Responsibility from chapter three. This completes the “audit” of one’s life, before moving on to the <strong>tools of productivity in chapter five</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="select-your-tools">Select Your Tools</h2>
<p>This is where things get really practical.</p>
<p>According to Challies, everyone needs the following three tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Task Management Tool (he recommends <a href="https://todoist.com/">ToDoist</a>, which I also use)</li>
<li>A Scheduling Tool (he recommends <a href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a>, which I also use)</li>
<li>An Information Tool (he recommends <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, which I also use)</li>
</ul>
<p>He also introduces the extremely important productivity principle: <strong>a home for everything, and like goes with like.</strong></p>
<h2 id="collect-your-tasks-plan-your-calendar-and-gather-your-information">Collect Your Tasks, Plan Your Calendar, and Gather Your Information</h2>
<p>In <strong>chapter six, Collect Your Tasks</strong>, Challies walks us through the process of setting up and beginning to use ToDoist. <strong>Chapter seven, Plan Your Calendar</strong>, is devoted to setting up and using Google Calendar. <strong>Chapter eight, Gather Your Information</strong>, is (you guessed it) devoted to setting up and using Evernote.</p>
<p>These three chapters are insanely helpful if you’re not already familiar with these three powerful tools!</p>
<h2 id="live-the-system">Live the System</h2>
<p>In <strong>chapter nine, Live the System</strong>, Challies covers how the three productivity tools work together in a cohesive personal productivity system on a daily level. This chapter contains a bunch of helpful information on how to prioritize and structure your day.</p>
<h2 id="maintain-it-consistently">Maintain it Consistently</h2>
<p><strong>Chapter ten, Maintain It Consistently</strong>, expands the horizon of focus to the weekly level. Challies walks us through the important process of the Weekly Review, focusing on the power of checklists and how we can “serve and surprise” in each of our areas of responsibilities and roles.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-material">Bonus Material</h2>
<p>As a <strong>bonus</strong>, <em>Do More Better</em> ends with <strong>6 Tips for Doing More Better with Email</strong> and <strong>20 Tips to Increase Your Productivity</strong>. My favorite tip from this section of the book is “6. Create a Not-To-Do-List”!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Create a note within Evernote that will contain a not-to-do-list. Make this a list of bad productivity habits you are trying to break, and go over this list each week during your weekly review. My not-to-do-list includes ‘Do not dring coffee after 2 p.m.,’ ‘Do not leave email open all day,’ and ‘Do not agree to meethings that have no agenda or no end-time’ (116-17).”</p>

      <title>Please Don&#39;t Leave Me Alone: On Male Friendships, or the Lack Thereof</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, consider yourself quite the introvert. Maybe you, like me, have a difficult time walking the tightrope between feeling quickly overwhelmed by interpersonal relationships, on the one hand, and feeling incredibly lonely, on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I’m sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be “alone together,” looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you, like me, consider yourself quite the introvert. Maybe you, like me, have a difficult time walking the tightrope between feeling quickly overwhelmed by interpersonal relationships, on the one hand, and feeling incredibly lonely, on the other hand.</p>
<p>Maybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I’m sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be “alone together,” looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).</p>
<p>Maybe we’re not alone.</p>
<h1 id="the-lonely-american-man">The Lonely American Man</h1>
<p>I just got done listening to a fantastic episode of the podcast Hidden Brain called <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/594719471/guys-we-have-a-problem-how-american-masculinity-creates-lonely-men">The Lonely American Man</a>.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you give this episode a listen, because it’s devoted to an important topic: how certain Western/American ideals of masculinity – the mythic man as a rugged individualist, needing no one in order to succeed – have led to men feeling increasingly isolated and lonely as they grow older.</p>
<p>I really resonated with this episode. Although my current role as a Ph.D. student (and my previous roles as a high school student, college student, and then a seminarian) have included some built-in male “acquaintances/colleagues,” at the very least, I’ve recognized how each stage has felt increasingly lonely. In fact, my closest male friendships now are with a couple people I know from high school – and we only see each other in person 1 or 2 times a year.</p>
<p>Sure, I spend more time face-to-face with my male Ph.D. colleagues, but we’re all just so busy. School, work, marriage, kids, etc. At least for me, in addition to feeling the pressure to not be overly emotional or vulnerable, there’s the added pressure of not wanting to burden other people. I know they’re busy. They know I’m busy. So, we end up just leaving each other alone, persuaded that’s what will make us happy (even if we feel terribly lonely).</p>
<p>If you listen to the end of the podcast episode I linked to above, you’ll hear about an interesting study/experiment performed on commuters. When given the choice/assignment of (1) not interacting with other commuters, (2) interacting with other commuters, and (3) carrying on as normal during their commute, people predicted that they would be happiest – and that other people would be happiest! – when they just stayed out of each other’s way. However, it turns out that we’re much happier when connecting with other people, and that other people are much more willing to connect with us than we often imagine!</p>
<h1 id="men-how-can-we-do-better">Men, How Can We Do Better?</h1>
<p>I need to do a better job of taking these things to heart in how I go about my daily life. Although I truly <em>am</em> an introvert – meaning that I need some time alone each day in order to recharge – I’m persuaded that I could benefit from some more meaningful friendships in my life – especially some more face-to-face friendships.</p>
<p>Although I’m sure there’s other great stuff on this topic out there, if you’re interested in this topic, I highly recommend the following posts from The Art of Manliness:</p>
<h2 id="making-and-keeping-man-friendshipshttpswwwartofmanlinesscom20081028how-to-make-friends"><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/10/28/how-to-make-friends/">“Making and Keeping Man Friendships”</a></h2>
<p>This post contains the following advice on making man/male friendships:<br>
– Join an organization<br>
– Make some friends at work<br>
– Meet your neighbors</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to maintaining male friendships:<br>
– Set a common goal<br>
– Create a competition<br>
– Take a “Mancation”<br>
– Have a “Guys Night Out”<br>
– Keep in touch with regular communication</p>

      <title>I Need to Develop a Writing Habit. Do You?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/i-need-to-develop-a-writing-habit-do-you/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:33:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/i-need-to-develop-a-writing-habit-do-you/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because good writing = good thinking, I believe that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; could benefit from developing the habit of regular writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am a Ph.D. student about to begin work on his dissertation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit a blog (&lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/&#34;&gt;Rookie Anglican&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write this personal blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to develop the habit of regular writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, I’ve largely relied upon writing in fits and starts, when the Muse descends, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because good writing = good thinking, I believe that <em>everyone</em> could benefit from developing the habit of regular writing.</p>
<p>However, because I</p>
<ul>
<li>Am a Ph.D. student about to begin work on his dissertation</li>
<li>Edit a blog (<a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">Rookie Anglican</a>)</li>
<li>Write this personal blog</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>really</em> need to develop the habit of regular writing.</p>
<p>Up until now, I’ve largely relied upon writing in fits and starts, when the Muse descends, as it were.</p>
<p>This, however, is not good enough (as Stephen Pressfield forcefully says in his book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2DDHfu7"><em>The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles</em></a>). It won’t get my dissertation written, nor will it help me stay on top of two different blogs!</p>
<p>What’s the solution? A regular writing habit, day in and day out.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-developchange-a-habit">How to develop/change a habit</h1>
<p>There are plenty of guides out there on the internet about the process of habit formation. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">The Habits Guide: How to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones </a>[James Clear]</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them">Habits: How They Form and How to Break Them</a> [NPR]</li>
<li><a href="https://zenhabits.net/habitses/">The Four Habits that Form Habits</a> [Zen Habits]</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, there are two excellent books on habit formation that I highly recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2HHVT5Z"><em>The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business</em></a> by Charles Duhigg</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2pnd5Xz"><em>Better than Before: What I Learned About Making and Breaking Habits–to Sleep More, Quit Sugar, Procrastinate Less, and Generally Build a Happier Life</em></a> by Gretchen Rubin</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="habit--trigger--behavior--reward">Habit = Trigger + Behavior + Reward</h2>
<p>If you look through those resources, you’ll notice a particular model that appears again and again. A habit boils down to three things (this version of the framework mainly comes from Charles Duhigg’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2pkxfBO"><em>The Power of Habit</em></a><em>.</em> You can read the appendix of the book for free <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">here</a>.) :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRIGGER</strong>: The cue or reminder that prompts the behavior. Frequently, cues involve
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>People (who are you with?)</li>
<li>Preceding Action (what did you just do?)</li>
<li>Emotion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong>: The behavior itself, whether something good for you, like writing 500 words every day, or something bad for you, like smoking a pack of cigarettes.</li>
<li><strong>REWARD</strong>: The benefit you get from the behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-change-an-old-habit-taken-from-this-helpful-flowcharthttpcharlesduhiggcomwp-contentuploads201404flowchart-how-to-change-a-habitpdf-from-charles-duhigg">To change an old habit (taken from <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Flowchart-How-to-Change-a-Habit.pdf">this helpful flowchart</a> from Charles Duhigg):</h2>
<ul>
<li>Isolate the consistent TRIGGER. When you feel the craving to do the thing you’re trying to stop doing, ask yourself:
<ul>
<li>What time is it?</li>
<li>Where are you?</li>
<li>Who else is around?</li>
<li>What did you just do?</li>
<li>What emotion are you feeling?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Isolate the consistent REWARD. What benefit/craving is this habit providing/satisfying? Come up with an idea and test the theory by substituting different rewards until you find something that makes the craving goes away. This is what you’re really craving as a result of the behavior.</li>
<li>Insert a new BEHAVIOR between the trigger and the reward.
<ul>
<li>Choose a new activity that is triggered by the old trigger and provides the old reward.</li>
<li>Write this commitment down in the following form: “When [TRIGGER occurs], I will [do the new BEHAVIOR], because it provides me with [the REWARD].”</li>
<li>Follow through on your plan!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-develop-a-new-habit-taken-from-this-helpful-flowcharthttpcharlesduhiggcomwp-contentuploads201404flowchart-how-to-create-a-habitpdf-from-charles-duhigg">To develop a new habit (taken from <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Flowchart-How-to-Create-a-Habit.pdf">this helpful flowchart</a> from Charles Duhigg):</h2>
<ul>
<li>Come up with a TRIGGER:
<ul>
<li>Time?</li>
<li>Location?</li>
<li>People around?</li>
<li>Immediately preceding action?</li>
<li>Emotion?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Come up with a REWARD for after the behavior:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you actually enjoy it!</li>
<li>Make sure that you crave this reward when exposed to the trigger from the previous step!</li>
<li>Ideally, you will eventually desire the habit for its intrinsic reward. That’s what you’re shooting for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Insert the BEHAVIOR into a routine:
<ul>
<li>Write it down in the following form: “When [TRIGGER occurs], I will [perform desired BEHAVIOR], because it provides me with [the REWARD].”</li>
<li>Follow through on your plan!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-develop-a-writing-habit-my-example">How to develop a writing habit: my example</h1>
<p>In theory, it’s pretty simple, actually. We just need to take the previous outline, for how to develop a new habit, and apply it to the specific behavior of writing consistently. 500 words a day is a great goal, and it’s the one I’ll be using.</p>
<p>First, however, we need a TRIGGER. For me, the trigger I’m going to try out for the next few days is “When I arrive at the library in the morning, before doing anything else…”</p>
<p>The REWARD I’m going to experiment with is: “…I will go for a 20-minute walk outside.”</p>
<p>Put together, my commitment looks like: “When I arrive at the library in the morning, before doing anything else, I will write 500 words, because then I get to go for a 20-minute walk outside.”</p>
<h1 id="what-about-you-what-will-your-writing-habit-look-like">What about you? What will your writing habit look like?</h1>
<p>Would you like to create a writing habit?</p>
<p>If so, what’s your trigger going to be?</p>
<p>What’s your reward going to be?</p>
<p>What’s your writing behavior going to look like? How often will you write? How many words?</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting Things Done (&amp;ldquo;GTD&amp;rdquo; for short) is a widely popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://lifehacker.com/getting-things-done-ten-years-in-1795707084&#34;&gt;Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;You don’t hear a lot of people talk about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gettingthingsdone.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; productivity system anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s a shame because it’s a very effective system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first tried Getting Things Done after reading &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2tMiX1w&#34;&gt;What’s Best Next&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Matt Perman and then reading &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2HvNJxv&#34;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting Things Done (&ldquo;GTD&rdquo; for short) is a widely popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/getting-things-done-ten-years-in-1795707084">Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017</a>, &ldquo;You don’t hear a lot of people talk about the <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> productivity system anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that’s a shame because it’s a very effective system.</p>
<p>I first tried Getting Things Done after reading &ldquo;<a href="http://amzn.to/2tMiX1w">What’s Best Next</a>&rdquo; by Matt Perman and then reading &ldquo;<a href="http://amzn.to/2HvNJxv">Getting Things Done</a>&rdquo; by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>At its core, GTD revolves around the following idea from David Allen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does that mean? Well, your brain does a much better job of coming up with random things than keeping track of them. Therefore, if you don’t have a system in place for reliably and comprehensively keeping track of all the random “open loops” your brain comes up with throughout the day, you will use up a lot of your mental bandwidth trying to remember everything instead of acting on them.</p>
<p>Enter the GTD system. It’s designed to solve the problem of tracking the “open loops” your brain creates—whether &ldquo;I need to buy milk&rdquo; or &ldquo;I need to revamp my blog.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-pillars-of-gtd">The &ldquo;Pillars&rdquo; of GTD</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Capture</strong>: Think on paper. Get stuff out of your head and into a list.</li>
<li><strong>Clarify</strong>: Decide whether each item is an action, a project, something to delete, defer, or delegate, etc. <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf">GTD Workflow Chart</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Organize</strong>: As you clarify, put things into different “buckets” – Action Lists, Project Lists, Someday/Maybe Lists, Waiting For Lists, Reference Materials, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong>: Look at your buckets regularly—daily and weekly.</li>
<li><strong>Engage</strong>: You know, get stuff done.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="getting-back-on-the-gtd-bandwagon">Getting Back on the GTD Bandwagon</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, after following GTD for a few years, I “fell off the bandwagon.” I got sloppy with capturing and clarifying my “open loops,” leading to more time worrying about what I had to do instead of reviewing my &ldquo;Next Action&rdquo; lists and moving forward, GTD-style.</p>
<p>Just this past week, I decided to get back on the GTD bandwagon. I’ve got a Ph.D. dissertation to write and a baby on the way, after all! There’s no time to spend worrying about things I’m forgetting. 🙂</p>

<h3 id="todoisthttpssupporttodoistcomhcen-usarticles203799792-getting-things-done-gtd-with-todoist"><a href="https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/203799792-Getting-Things-Done-GTD-with-Todoist">ToDoist</a></h3>
<p>ToDoist is a fantastic task manager that I use to keep track of my personal tasks and projects.</p>
<h3 id="google-calendarhttpscalendargooglecom"><a href="https://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a></h3>
<p>I use Google Calendar for managing my schedule—pretty straightforward. 🙂</p>
<h3 id="gmailhttpsmailgooglecom"><a href="https://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a></h3>
<p>For email communication, I use Gmail along with <a href="https://unroll.me/">Unroll.Me</a> and <a href="https://www.boomeranggmail.com/">Boomerang</a>, both of which I highly recommend. I have three simple folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>@ACTION_SUPPORT</strong></li>
<li><strong>@KEEP</strong></li>
<li><strong>@WAITING_FOR_SUPPORT</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When an email requires action, I place it in the <strong>@ACTION_SUPPORT</strong> folder and create a task in ToDoist to remind me. If it&rsquo;s a reference email, I archive it or move it to the <strong>@KEEP</strong> folder. For emails I’m waiting on others to act, I set a follow-up reminder in ToDoist and move it to <strong>@WAITING_FOR_SUPPORT</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="evernotehttpsevernotecom"><a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a></h3>
<p>Evernote is my second brain—my reference system for everything from receipts to class notes.</p>

      <title>This Song is a Beautiful Picture of the Theological Journey</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-truth-is-not-a-cave/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently privileged to see one of my favorite bands, &lt;a href=&#34;http://theohhellos.com/&#34;&gt;The Oh Hellos&lt;/a&gt;, in concert at the House of Blues in downtown Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love all of The Oh Hellos’ music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it. The song is called “The Truth is a Cave,” and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I’m calling “the theological journey” – the stages one goes through in one’s knowledge of God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently privileged to see one of my favorite bands, <a href="http://theohhellos.com/">The Oh Hellos</a>, in concert at the House of Blues in downtown Chicago.</p>
<p>I love all of The Oh Hellos’ music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it. The song is called “The Truth is a Cave,” and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I’m calling “the theological journey” – the stages one goes through in one’s knowledge of God.</p>
<h1 id="the-truth-is-not-a-cave">The Truth is [NOT] a Cave</h1>
<p>Here’s a video. Give the song a listen.</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="563" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTMObl4CqoU?feature=oembed" title="The Truth Is A Cave - The Oh Hello's" width="750"></iframe>
<p>Here are the lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was young and naive<br>
As I was told, so I believed<br>
And I was told there’s only one road that leads you home</p>
<p>And the truth was a cave on the mountainside<br>
And I’d seek it out until the day I died</p>
<p>I was bound and determined<br>
To be the child that you wanted<br>
But I was blind to every sign you left for me to find</p>
<p>And the truth became a tool that I held in my hand<br>
I wielded it, but I didn’t understand</p>
<p>I got tired of giving more than you gave to me<br>
And I desired a truth I wouldn’t have to seek</p>
<p>But in the silence, I heard you calling out to me</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-truth-is-neither-a-position-nor-a-possession-but-a-person">The Truth is neither a Position, nor a Possession, but a Person.</h1>
<p>ˆThere’s my summary of the song’s message in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Verse one portrays the truth as a distant and unattainable cave. I think that’s where we all start off in our theological journeys. The danger at this beginning stage is that God feels very distant and aloof. If we’re not careful, we can tire out and despair while “seeking out [the truth] until the day [we] die.”</p>
<p>However, things don’t get any better in verse two, where the truth is a tool. We, especially formal students of theology like myself, can quickly get caught up in our zeal for theological truth (“I was bound and determined / To be the child that you wanted”), missing the ways in which God actually wants to speak to us (“But I was blind to every sign you left for me to find”).</p>
<p>The result? We act like the truth about God is something we can possess and use to our own advantage. We treat theology like a swordfight or a dojo.</p>
<p>This gets us to verse three, the stage of the burnt-out theologian: “I got tired of giving more than you gave to me. And I desired a truth I wouldn’t have to seek.”</p>
<p>I could pretend like I don’t know why those words often bring tears to my eyes, but I do.</p>
<p>Pour your heart, mind, and soul into the theological task – as if it all depends on you and your zealous efforts to plumb the depths of the divine mysteries – and you will be brought to anger and/or despair by a world that so often feels godless, if not god-forsaken.</p>
<p>Good news, though: It doesn’t all depend on you and your theological efforts. God reveals himself to us, even (especially) when we least expect it: “But in the silence, I heard you calling out to me.”</p>
<p>Good news: The truth isn’t a cave.</p>
<p>The truth isn’t a tool.</p>
<p>The truth is a Person. Have you met the Truth?</p>

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the trip was to visit some good friends of ours, the Smith family, in Phoenix, AZ. Here’s a picture of the group of us together after church at &lt;a href=&#34;https://livingfaithanglican.org/&#34;&gt;Living Faith Anglican Church in Tempe, AZ&lt;/a&gt;, where my friend Peter Smith is the rector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip was a blast. It was great to catch up with the Smiths and to see their new home and church in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The main reason for the trip was to visit some good friends of ours, the Smith family, in Phoenix, AZ. Here’s a picture of the group of us together after church at <a href="https://livingfaithanglican.org/">Living Faith Anglican Church in Tempe, AZ</a>, where my friend Peter Smith is the rector.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3626-1024x768.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>The trip was a blast. It was great to catch up with the Smiths and to see their new home and church in Arizona.</p>
<p>Plus, we got to go hiking at (1) Saguaro Lake,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3618-1024x768.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>(2) Cathedral Rock in Sedona,</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3663.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>and (3) the South Kaibab Trail at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_3743.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>(That last photo is my favorite from the entire trip. Thanks to the random guy on the trail who took it for us!)</p>
<p>Having never been to the Southwest before, I was frequently overwhelmed by the beauty of the views and the landscape. At certain points, it didn’t even feel real.</p>
<h3 id="however-something-else-struck-me-about-the-views-and-the-landscape-the-combination-of-danger-and-beauty">However, something else struck me about the views and the landscape: the combination of danger and beauty.</h3>
<p>At the Grand Canyon, this was especially obvious when we considered how high above the canyon floor we were during our hike. However, even when we weren’t sitting or standing on a precarious ledge, even when we were standing on flat ground, we were still in the middle of the desert! Without food, water, shelter, and transportation, the beautiful landscape would have made short work of us.</p>
<h3 id="this-has-me-thinking-about-the-relationships-between-beauty-safety-and-danger-in-other-areas-of-life">This has me thinking about the relationships between beauty, safety, and danger in other areas of life.</h3>
<p>We’d love it, wouldn’t we, if the most beautiful things/experiences were always safe. But they aren’t.</p>
<p>There’s frequently risk and danger involved in life’s most beautiful and meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that we ought to live life recklessly, with no concern for the risks and dangers involved!</p>
<p>But it is a good reminder that we are, perhaps, more concerned with safety and risk-mitigation than God is.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-any-examples-of-dangerous-risky-beauty-in-your-own-life-id-love-to-hear-about-them-in-the-comments-below">Do you have any examples of dangerous, risky beauty in your own life? I’d love to hear about them in the comments below!</h3>

      <title>This One Simple Trick Helps Me Read Faster as a Ph.D. Student</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/one-simple-trick-helps-read-faster-ph-d-student/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 06:00:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/one-simple-trick-helps-read-faster-ph-d-student/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading is the closest thing that human beings have to a superpower. We can learn, from other minds, from other times, just by looking at symbols on a screen or a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I mean, come on. Who has enough time to read? I don’t know about you, but I’ve got a stack of books a mile high that I’d like to work my way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there’s a bunch of good advice out there about &lt;strong&gt;finding more time to read&lt;/strong&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fs.blog/2013/09/finding-time-to-read/&#34;&gt;this post from Farnam Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artofmanliness.com/2018/02/26/how-to-read-more-books/&#34;&gt;this post from The Art of Manliness&lt;/a&gt;). In fact, finding more time to read is one of the main reasons why you should learn the basics of personal productivity and time management (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/category/productivity-and-time-management/&#34;&gt;my posts about productivity and time management&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading is the closest thing that human beings have to a superpower. We can learn, from other minds, from other times, just by looking at symbols on a screen or a page.</p>
<p>But, I mean, come on. Who has enough time to read? I don’t know about you, but I’ve got a stack of books a mile high that I’d like to work my way through.</p>
<p>Now, there’s a bunch of good advice out there about <strong>finding more time to read</strong> (see <a href="https://www.fs.blog/2013/09/finding-time-to-read/">this post from Farnam Street</a> and <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2018/02/26/how-to-read-more-books/">this post from The Art of Manliness</a>). In fact, finding more time to read is one of the main reasons why you should learn the basics of personal productivity and time management (see <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/category/productivity-and-time-management/">my posts about productivity and time management</a>).</p>
<p>However, even if you manage to find more time to read, it can be very helpful to <strong>improve your reading speed</strong>.</p>
<p>As a Ph.D. student, this is something that I’ve tried to get better at in recent months. I’d like to share my top tip/trick. Here it is:</p>
<h2 id="use-a-penpencilfinger-as-a-pacer-when-you-read">Use a Pen/Pencil/Finger as a Pacer When You Read</h2>
<p>That’s right. Whenever I read these days, I’m using <em>something</em> as a pacer, tracing under each line of text as I read it. (I’m usually also standing and pacing around to avoid falling asleep!)</p>
<p>It might seem stupidly simple tip, but it’s crazy how much using something – whether a pen, pencil, or just your finger – as a pacer can help you read faster. It cuts down on the number of times your eye bounces around on the page, and it enables you to read exactly as quickly as you’d like to – you can slow down or speed up at will.</p>
<p>I first considered using a pacer while reading after reading Tim Ferriss’s wildly popular blog post, <a href="https://tim.blog/2009/07/30/speed-reading-and-accelerated-learning/">“Scientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20 Minutes”</a>. I encourage you to give that post a read if you’re interested.</p>
<p>Or, if you’d rather watch a video of Tim teaching his technique, check this one out:</p>

<p>Anyways, I hope this simple tip helps you to read faster when you want to! Give it a try and let me know what you think.</p>

      <title>Christian, Do the Daily Office: 5 Things You Can Learn from Morning and Evening Prayer</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-problem-we-all-need-to-grow-but-were-not-sure-how&#34;&gt;The Problem: We All Need to Grow, But We’re Not Sure How&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lets-face-it-to-say-the-very-least-we-christians-all-have-room-to-grow-when-it-comes-to-following-jesus&#34;&gt;Let’s face it: to say the very least, we Christians all have room to grow when it comes to following Jesus.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us has “arrived.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s always more to learn about who God is, what God has done, and how we can join God’s mission to set the world right again. And, even if we know a bunch about those things in the previous sentence, we surely don’t always live based on that knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>None of us has “arrived.”</p>
<p>There’s always more to learn about who God is, what God has done, and how we can join God’s mission to set the world right again. And, even if we know a bunch about those things in the previous sentence, we surely don’t always live based on that knowledge!</p>
<h3 id="thankfully-there-are-a-ton-of-resources-out-there-that-promise-to-help-us-grow-in-our-walk-with-god">Thankfully, there are a TON of resources out there that promise to help us grow in our walk with God.</h3>
<h3 id="unfortunately-there-are-a-ton-of-resources-out-there">Unfortunately, there are a TON of resources out there.</h3>
<p>Seriously, where are you supposed to begin? I just went to Amazon, and there are over 200,000 results in the category of Books &gt; Christian Books and Bibles &gt; Christian Living. To narrow things down, I clicked on the sub-category “Spiritual Growth,” and there are still over 40,000 results.</p>
<p>Look, I don’t mean to slight all of these Spiritual Growth resources out there. I really don’t. Some of them are excellent, and I may even write one of my own someday.</p>
<h3 id="however-in-my-view-the-explosion-of-spiritual-growth-material-createsexacerbates-the-danger-of-an-individualistic-and-consumeristic-approach-to-the-christian-life">However, in my view, the explosion of spiritual growth material creates/exacerbates the danger of an individualistic and consumeristic approach to the Christian life.</h3>
<p>If you wanted to, you could spend the rest of your life bouncing around from niche spiritual growth resource to niche spiritual growth resource. From one book study to the next. Getting tired of something? Try something new!</p>
<p>While there’s nothing wrong with novelty or changing things up to keep one’s spiritual life fresh, as it were, the danger is that we might end up with nothing but novelty, nothing but our individual interests driving our walk with the Lord.</p>
<p>If that happens, we’re going to miss out on the riches of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripture. All of Scripture, not just our favorite parts.</li>
<li>The Church: All of the Church, not just our local church, now, but the global Church, throughout history.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-solution-the-daily-office-of-morning-and-evening-prayer">The Solution: The Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer</h1>
<p>HEAR ME, HEAR ME: Doing the Daily Office will NOT solve all of your spiritual problems. That’s not what I’m saying. For one thing, you need the ministry of the Holy Spirit. For another, you need baptismal and eucharistic communion with the people of God.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer is an ancient Christian (and, even before that, Jewish!) tradition that, I believe, can help us avoid the individualistic and consumeristic dangers of the Christian spirituality industrial complex.</p>
<p>The Daily Office is NOT just an Anglican thing. However, the Anglican tradition is one of several Christian traditions that have preserved the practice. And so it is something that the Anglian tradition can offer the entire Body of Christ.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="here-are-5-things-that-you-can-learn-from-the-daily-office-of-morning-and-evening-prayer">Here Are 5 Things that You Can Learn from the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer</h1>
<h2 id="1-your-mornings-and-evenings-belong-to-god">1. Your Mornings and Evenings Belong to God</h2>
<p>Hopefully, you and I both know this already. Our entire day belongs to God!</p>
<p>However, I don’t know about you, but I need regular reminders that time – all of it – is sacred. This is why I appreciate the <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/what-time-is-it-an-overview-of-the-church-calendar-and-liturgical-year/">Church Calendar</a>, and it’s also why I appreciate the Daily Office. Beginning and ending each day with Scripture and prayer reminds me that the day and night in between prayer services belong to God.</p>
<p>By the way, the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer is not new, nor is it esoterically Anglican.</p>
<p>As Arthur Paul Boers noted in his <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/january8/2.40.html">2001 Christianity Today piece, “The Rise and Fall of the Daily Office,”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The practice of daily, set prayer goes back to the Old Testament. The Psalms speak of prayer in the morning (5:3), early hours (130:6), evening (141:2), and day and night (92:2). Psalm 119:164a says, “Seven times a day I praise you.” Scripture also mentions thrice-daily prayers (Ps. 55:17, Dan. 6:10). Jews said the Shema (a Scripture-based prayer praising God’s greatness) two or three times a day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The practice of the Daily Office or “fixed-hour prayer” developed from the Early Church through the Middle Ages, by which time it had developed into quite an elaborate monastic practice that was, by and large, inaccessible to the laity</p>
<p>One of many brilliant moves of Thomas Cranmer was to pare the medieval monastic hours of prayer down to the Daily Office of Matins (Morning Prayer) and Evensong (Evening Prayer) as it was included in <a href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1549/BCP_1549.htm">the 1549 (and subsequent) Book of Common Prayer.</a> Instead of learning Latin and praying 7 or 8 times a day, people could now pray twice a day in English, their native tongue.</p>
<h2 id="2-your-walk-with-god-is-about-more-than-just-your-emotions">2. Your Walk With God is About More Than Just Your Emotions</h2>
<p>Growing up and into college, my “daily devotions,” “quiet time,” or the lack thereof frequently depended upon my emotions. When I felt super spiritual, maybe after a youth retreat or something, I was pretty regular in my daily devotions. However, as the emotional high faded, so did my daily quiet times.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I discovered the Daily Office in seminary that I realized just how beneficial a structured approach to Scripture and prayer was. Doing the Daily Office, even when I didn’t (and don’t) particularly feel like it is a good reminder that (1) God desires faithful obedience and (2) I am more than just my emotions.</p>
<p>It’s called the Daily “Office,” by the way, as in Daily “Duty” or “Obligation.”</p>
<p>Wait, isn’t that legalism?? Well sure, your approach to the Daily Office can become legalistic. You can doggedly do it, even when you don’t feel like it, thinking that doing so is somehow earning you more of God’s love and favor.</p>
<p>But you would be wrong!</p>
<p>We don’t obey God’s commands in order to earn God’s love. Rather, we obey God’s commands because we have already been shown God’s love! We are commanded, for example, to love one another. But, of course, we love because God first loved us! (See 1 John 4.)</p>
<h3 id="heres-the-thing-though-for-our-own-good-we-still-need-to-obey-god-even-when-we-dont-feel-like-it">Here’s the thing, though: For our own good, we still need to obey God, even when we don’t feel like it!</h3>
<p>Sure, there’s no explicit command in Scripture to “do the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer.” However, we are commanded to pray (and rejoice/give thanks, see 1 Thess. 5:16-18 for just one example). We are also commanded to heed God’s holy Word (see, for example, Josh. 1:8; Psalm 119; Matt. 4:4; 1 Tim. 4:13).</p>
<p>So, at the very least, the Daily Office gives us the opportunity to obey God’s commands – even when we don’t feel like it.</p>
<h2 id="3-scripture-and-prayer-are-your-daily-food">3. Scripture and Prayer Are Your Daily Food</h2>
<p>Of course, Jesus said this best when he quoted Deuteronomy 8:3 in Matthew 4:4: <span class="text Matt-4-4" id="en-ESV-23214"><span class="woj">“It is written, </span></span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">‘Man shall not live by bread alone, </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”</span></p>
<p>I have found that doing the Daily Office, even when I don’t particularly feel like it, is a helpful reminder that Scripture and prayer are my daily food.</p>
<p>Do I remember exactly what I ate for breakfast last Wednesday? No.</p>
<p>Do I know that I ate something? Yes. Did it help keep me alive that day? Yes.</p>
<p>Similarly: Do I remember exactly what I read and prayed during Morning Prayer last Wednesday? No.</p>
<p>Do I know that I did Morning Prayer? Yes. Did it help to sustain and to shape me as a follower of Jesus Christ that day? Yes.</p>
<p>Sure, sometimes we will have moments of particular “transcendence” when reading the Bible and/or praying. However, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that Scripture and prayer are only meaningful to the extent that they <em>feel</em> meaningful. That would be like thinking a meal is only a good meal when it’s a steak dinner or something spectacular.</p>
<p>Scripture and prayer are meaningful, valuable, and necessary, even when they don’t feel particularly earth-shattering on any given morning or evening during the Daily Office.</p>
<p>That’s OK. Do the Daily Office and trust that God is sustaining and shaping you, even when it doesn’t feel like it.</p>
<h2 id="4-you-are-not-alone">4. You Are Not Alone</h2>
<p>Doing the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer is a great reminder that you are not alone when you’re reading the Bible and praying.</p>
<p>Ideally, this should be a very visible and tangible reminder! We should do the Daily Office with other Christians whenever possible.</p>
<p>However, even when you’re doing Morning or Evening Prayer “by yourself,” it’s comforting to know that Christians around the world (and, on another level, throughout history) are doing Morning and Evening Prayer. You are praying with (and, hopefully, for) the global, historic Church of Jesus Christ!</p>
<h2 id="5-god-loves-you-even-when-you-cant-get-your-act-together-and-do-the-daily-office">5. God Loves You, Even When You Can’t Get Your Act Together and Do the Daily Office!</h2>
<p>The Daily Office can be an encouragement – it can be good news – even when you fail to keep it!</p>
<p>Doing the Daily Office ought to remind us that our acts of faithful obedience are both meaningful and frail.</p>
<p>After all, it is so easy to forget or to skip Morning or Evening Prayer. It is so easy to fly through the prayers and the readings because we’re busy, tired, anxious, or all of the above. It is so easy to “fall short.”</p>
<p>And that’s OK! God still loves you!</p>
<p>Don’t fall prey to the lie that, if you can’t do the Daily Office perfectly, you might as well not do it at all.</p>
<p>No! Not true! None of us does anything perfectly!</p>
<p>Yet, God still loves us. And he still wants what’s best for us.</p>
<p>He wants our faithful obedience, but, in the comforting words of Psalm 103:14, “he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.”</p>

&lt;p&gt;First, for me, Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism. Now, to be sure, we do have our own fundamentalists within the Anglican Communion!

It has been an ecclesiological space for healing as I seek to “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/08/on-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater-a-message-for-abused-ex-fundamentalists/&#34;&gt;not throw the (gospel) baby out with the (fundamentalist) bathwater&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

</a></p>
<p>Why am I an Anglican Christian? Here are 3 reasons.</p>
<h1 id="1-anglicanism-as-a-refuge-from-fundamentalism">1. Anglicanism as a Refuge from Fundamentalism</h1>
<p>First, for me, Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism. Now, to be sure, we do have our own fundamentalists within the Anglican Communion! But, compared to some “ingrown enclaves” I’ve experienced in my Christian upbringing, Anglicanism has been a breath of fresh air. It has been an ecclesiological space for healing as I seek to “<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/08/on-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater-a-message-for-abused-ex-fundamentalists/">not throw the (gospel) baby out with the (fundamentalist) bathwater</a>.”</p>
<p>Why/How?</p>
<h1 id="2-anglicanism-has-theological-breadth">2. Anglicanism has Theological Breadth…</h1>
<p>This goes hand-in-hand with my previous reason. Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism thanks in no small part to its “theological wiggle room.” The greatest strength of Anglicanism – and also the source of much of its angst – is its theological breadth. As a Ph.D. student in theology, I appreciate the fact that it doesn’t feel like I’m walking along the edge of a knife, to the right or left of which my positions would quickly become <em>verboten</em> by the Anglican powers that be.</p>
<p>Instead, it feels like I’m operating on a field of acceptable Anglican theological convictions/positions.</p>
<h1 id="3-within-a-tradition">3. …Within a Tradition</h1>
<p>However, that “field” does have boundaries, for which I am grateful!</p>
<p>And, for Anglicanism at its best, those boundaries largely coincide with the overarching tradition of the Christian Church as she has been sustained and guided by the Holy Spirit throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>So, on the one hand, I’m grateful for some theological wiggle room, as it were. On the other hand, I’m grateful that it’s not “just me and my Bible” as if I had to try to figure everything out anew!</p>
<p>The same Spirit, whom I trust to illuminate my mind and heart as I read Scripture, has provided the Church with teachers and leaders throughout the ages. This doesn’t mean that the “tradition” should be adopted wholesale, unthinkingly, and uncritically – far from it! But, the traditions of the Church ought to be received humbly and prayerfully.</p>
<p>So, to sum up: <strong>I’m an Anglican Christian because, with its theological breadth within the overarching Christian tradition, Anglicanism has provided a salutary refuge for me from fundamentalism.</strong></p>
<h1 id="why-are-you-an-anglican-christian">Why Are You an Anglican Christian?</h1>
<p>I could mention other reasons why I’m an Anglican Christian – such as the emphasis on the habitual rhythms of the Christian life (e.g., the <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/dailyofficebooklet/">Daily Office</a>, the liturgical <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/what-time-is-it-an-overview-of-the-church-calendar-and-liturgical-year/">calendar</a>, etc.). However, I’m going to stick with these 3, because I want to hear your story!</p>
<p>If you’re an Anglican Christian – why?</p>

      <title>Go to Sleep and Have Some Kids: What the Bible (Psalm 127) Says about Productivity</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/go-sleep-kids-bible-psalm-127-says-productivity/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 12:51:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/go-sleep-kids-bible-psalm-127-says-productivity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-productivity-in-psalm-127&#34;&gt;Personal Productivity in Psalm 127&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the Psalm opens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;Unless the &lt;span class=&#34;small-caps&#34;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; builds the house,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1-breaks&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;the builders labor in vain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;Unless the &lt;span class=&#34;small-caps&#34;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; watches over the city,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1-breaks&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;the guards stand watch in vain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="personal-productivity-in-psalm-127">Personal Productivity in Psalm 127</h2>
<p>I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).</p>
<p>Here’s how the Psalm opens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Ps-127-1">Unless the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> builds the house,</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-1">the builders labor in vain.</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-1">Unless the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> watches over the city,</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-1">the guards stand watch in vain.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.</p>
<p>Not true! It doesn’t matter how hard you work. If the Lord is not behind it and in favor of it, you’ll be laboring in vain.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this Psalm doesn’t undo the Bible other admonitions to work diligently, lest you fall into poverty (see my post about <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/20110210proverbs-topical-study-poverty/">Poverty in the book of Proverbs</a>).</p>
<p>However, it does have implications for when we go to bed!</p>
<h2 id="go-to-sleep">Go to Sleep</h2>
<p>Verse 2 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Ps-127-2" id="en-NIV-16124">In vain you rise early</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-2">and stay up late,</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-2">toiling for food to eat—</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-2">for he grants sleep to those he loves.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, personal productivity advice these days has come around to recognizing the vital importance of sleep for your health.</p>
<p>However, I don’t know about you, but I often feel the nagging temptation that, if only I could squeeze a few extra hours out of the day, I could turn things around. To be perfectly honest, this is one of the reasons why I try to get up early (~5:00am) most mornings.</p>
<p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with getting up early in the morning. After all, Jesus himself did so, in order to pray (see Mark 1:35).</p>
<p>However, if you’re staying up late and getting up early in order to toil away because you think your work and success depends only on your efforts, then this Psalm encourages you to go to bed. Get some sleep. Learn to receive each day, along with exactly as much time as it contains, as a gift from God.</p>
<h2 id="have-some-kids">Have Some Kids</h2>
<p>The second part of the Psalm hits close to home as well! (See my previous post: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/3-confessions-expectant-father/">3 Confessions of an Expectant Father</a>.)</p>
<p>Verses 3-5 read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Ps-127-3" id="en-NIV-16125">Children are a heritage from the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>,</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-3">offspring a reward from him.</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-4" id="en-NIV-16126">Like arrows in the hands of a warrior</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-4">are children born in one’s youth.</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-5" id="en-NIV-16127">Blessed is the man</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-5">whose quiver is full of them.</span></span><br>
<span class="text Ps-127-5">They will not be put to shame</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Ps-127-5">when they contend with their opponents in court.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I don’t have space here to address the complicated issue of infertility or other things that get in the way of having children. Just know that these verses don’t negate the fact that God loves and draws near to people going through such things in their times of pain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these verses also teach an important truth: children are a blessing from God.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love kids. And, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/3-confessions-expectant-father/">as I’ve said in my previous post, I’m excited to be a dad</a>!</p>
<p>And yet, I think that I’m going to need this Psalm as a frequent reminder in the days and years ahead! Personal productivity advice has come around to the idea of sleep being important, but I don’t know if there’s broad consensus on children always being considered a blessing! If you ask many people, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-happiness-doctor/201709/does-having-children-make-us-happy">the jury is still out on whether or not having children makes you happier</a> – much less more productive!!</p>
<h2 id="reminders-of-our-finitude">Reminders of Our Finitude</h2>
<p>So, I think this Psalm is a countercultural reminder that both sleep and children are good gifts from God.</p>
<p>They are BOTH reminders that we are finite creatures who cannot accomplish everything (or even <em>anything</em> meaningful) on our own. Instead, even though we are called to make the best use of our time, we are to receive each day as a gift from God – recognizing that, without his constant provision and sustenance, we would perish.</p>
<p>So, take heart! Go to bed a little earlier tonight! Everything doesn’t depend on you.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;were-expecting&#34;&gt;We’re Expecting!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you haven’t heard the news, my wife Rachel and I are expecting our firstborn child this August! Rachel is currently 16 weeks along, and we won’t find out the gender of the baby (whom I am affectionately calling “Lump”) for another month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_3515-e1519734672450-1024x777.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She works full-time as a Family Nurse Practitioner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m a full-time Ph.D. student.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re both actively involved in our church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc. etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;however-the-next-few-months-also-promise-to-be-busy-as-well&#34;&gt;However, the next few months also promise to be busy as well!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve got a dissertation proposal to defend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll be traveling for our siblings’ high school graduation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Lord-willing and baby-waiting) we’ll both be in my sister-in-law’s wedding this Summer (I’m the officiant).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then? Then Lump makes his or her appearance!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<li>(Lord-willing and baby-waiting) we’ll both be in my sister-in-law’s wedding this Summer (I’m the officiant).</li>
</ul>
<p>And then? Then Lump makes his or her appearance!</p>
<h2 id="3-confessions-of-an-expectant-father">3 Confessions of an Expectant Father</h2>
<p>Anyways, this might be a bit self-serving, but amidst all the busyness, I thought I’d take a few minutes to write down some of my thoughts and feelings as I await the birth of my firstborn child.</p>
<p>(I’ve been inspired to do this by reading the extremely helpful <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2F0eMQv">The Expectant Father: The Ultimate Guide for Dads-to-Be</a></em> [affiliate link]. I highly recommend it to you if it’s relevant to your situation!)</p>
<p>OK, here goes:</p>
<h3 id="1-im-anxious-and-stressed">1. I’m Anxious and Stressed</h3>
<p>I’m not necessarily putting this first because I feel it the strongest/most, but rather because I’m the most embarrassed by it!</p>
<p>I’m anxious and stressed when it comes to my future as a parent, largely because the future has an annoying tendency to remain unknown! As a perfectionist – as a 1 on the Enneagram (check out <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2BTmugK">The Road Back to You</a></em> [affiliate link] if you don’t know what that means) – I don’t like such uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if there are health complications with the pregnancy, delivery, or the baby?</li>
<li>How will we navigate all of the complexities of parenting?</li>
<li>What will our new schedule/life look like?</li>
<li>How will we deal with the sleep deprivation?!</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, something that’s weighing particularly heavy on me right now is: <strong>How will I provide for my family?</strong></p>
<p>Rachel’s been earning the lion’s share of our income for the duration of our marriage, first as a Registered Nurse and now as a Family Nurse Practitioner. I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, by the way. She’s crazy good at what she does, and her earning potential as an RN and FNP has been quite higher than mine as a seminarian and now a Ph.D. student!</p>
<p>However, with a baby on the way, we’d like for Rachel to be able to stay at home as much as she would like to as soon as possible after the baby’s born. And, as a Ph.D. student who wants to become a pastor-theologian (check out <a href="http://amzn.to/2F9xCbu"><em>The Pastor Theologian</em></a> [affiliate link] if you don’t know what that means), my earning potential isn’t exactly skyrocketing right now.</p>
<p>This is forcing me to get creative and try to come up with ideas for an extra source(s) of income (“side hustles,” as they’re called – check out <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2ovTvbe">Side Hustle: From Idea to Income in 27 Days</a></em> [affiliate link] to learn more). However, getting creative is hard work, of course!</p>
<p>Anyways, there’s just a glimpse of my stress/anxiety.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that’s not all that’s on my mind and heart!</p>
<h3 id="2-im-thankful-and-grateful">2. I’m Thankful and Grateful</h3>
<p>First and foremost, I’m grateful to <strong>God</strong> for providing the gift of a new life and entrusting it to our care.</p>
<p>Second, I’m thankful for my <strong>wife</strong>. Rachel is amazing. She’s going to be a fantastic mother, and there’s no one else I’d rather be a parent alongside!</p>
<p>However, I have also experienced a recent spike in gratitude for my <strong>parents</strong>. It’s crazy to think that, about 27 years ago, my parents were in the exact same situation, and <em>I</em> was the firstborn child on the way, about to change their lives forever!</p>
<p>27 years later, and I’ve been the recipient of countless acts of selfless love and generosity from Patrick and Donna Steele. I’m incredibly grateful for such loving and God-fearing parents (to say nothing of my loving and God-fearing in-laws!). I hope to pay the parenting gift forward, as it were, to the next generation.</p>
<h3 id="3-im-pumped-and-excited">3. I’m Pumped and Excited</h3>
<p>Yes, I’m anxious. Sure, I’m grateful. But I’m also pumped! I’m excited to be a dad!</p>
<p>Rachel and I have always loved children. In fact, I’ve developed a reputation as “The Baby Whisperer” in recent years (we’ll see how long that lasts).</p>
<p>Now, we get to raise a child of our own!</p>
<p>Will we desperately need the Lord’s help at every step of the way? You bet!</p>
<p>Thankfully, we serve a God who is ready and willing to provide such help!</p>

      <title>Mental Models: A Helpful Model for Theology?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This idea has been bouncing around in my head for a bit. It’s not fully-formed by any means, but I’d like to get it out there and hear what you think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here it is: “Mental Models” could be a helpful model for theology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-a-mental-model&#34;&gt;What is a “mental model”?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition-of-mental-models&#34;&gt;Definition of mental models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, a “mental model” is a concept used to help explain how the world works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This idea has been bouncing around in my head for a bit. It’s not fully-formed by any means, but I’d like to get it out there and hear what you think of it.</p>
<p><strong>Here it is: “Mental Models” could be a helpful model for theology.</strong></p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-mental-model">What is a “mental model”?</h1>
<h2 id="definition-of-mental-models">Definition of mental models</h2>
<p>Put simply, a “mental model” is a concept used to help explain how the world works.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model"><strong>mental model</strong></a> is an explanation of someone’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought" title="Thought">thought</a> process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person’s intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour" title="Behaviour">behaviour</a> and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a>) and doing tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a helpful video from <a href="https://www.fs.blog/mental-models/">Farnam Street</a> explaining mental models (and giving an idea of how they’re usually appropriated these days for decision making and personal development):</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/177585900?dnt=1&app_id=122963" title="Farnam Street: Mental Models" width="750"></iframe>
<h2 id="examples-of-mental-models">Examples of mental models</h2>
<p>For example, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/80-20-approach-christian-life-2-reasons-christians-care-pareto-principle/">the 80/20 Principle</a> (20% of causes lead to 80% of effects) and the <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/prioritize-life-5-minutes-introduction-eisenhower-decision-matrix/">Eisenhower Decision Matrix</a> (organizing things by importance and urgency to prioritize decisions) could both be considered mental models.</p>
<p>Another famous mental model is <a href="https://www.fs.blog/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/">Occam’s Razor</a>, the idea that the simplest hypothesis is preferable.</p>
<p>One of my personal favorite mental models is <a href="https://www.fs.blog/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/">Hanlon’s Razor</a>, the idea that one should “never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.”</p>
<h2 id="mental-models-are-trueuseful-but-also-limited">*Mental models are TRUE/USEFUL, but also LIMITED*</h2>
<p>This is, perhaps, the most important thing about mental models.</p>
<p>On the one hand, a mental model needs to be true and useful. It needs to accurately describe at least one thing about how the world works.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, a mental model is LIMITED. No single model can accurately account for the way the entire world works!</p>
<p>So, instead of clinging to one mental model and acting like it’s somehow comprehensive, you’re much better off developing a “toolbox” or a “latticework” (to borrow Charlie Munger’s phrase) of mental models.</p>
<h1 id="examples-of-theological-mental-models">Examples of theological mental models</h1>
<p>Theology is filled with statements and theories that, I think, work a lot like mental models. They are designed to accurately describe some aspect of theological reality. And yet, they are also limited. No single model/statement can account for everything about the person and work of the Triune God.</p>
<p>For one thing, many of the <a href="http://amzn.to/2F1gkgu">central themes of biblical theology</a> [affiliate link] could be considered analogous to mental models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Covenants</li>
<li>Divine Commands</li>
<li>Atonement</li>
<li>Servant of the Lord</li>
<li>Day of the Lord</li>
<li>People of God</li>
<li>History of Redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>Atonement theories also tend to work much like mental models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom_theory_of_atonement">Ransom Theory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christus_Victor">Christus Victor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfaction_theory_of_atonement">Satisfaction Theory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_influence_theory_of_atonement">Moral Influence Theory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, consider the following Trinitarian theological mental models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zondervanacademic.com/blog/common-places-pro-nicene-theology-inseparable-operations/">Inseparable Operations</a>: how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit relate to each other</li>
<li>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rahner#Economic_and_immanent_Trinity">Rahner’s Rule</a>“: “the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4-reasons-why-mental-models-might-be-useful-for-theology">4 Reasons why mental models might be useful for theology</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Again, here’s my idea: Mental models could provide a helpful model for theology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Why? </span></p>
<h2 id="1-mental-models-could-help-keep-theologians-humble">1. Mental Models could help keep theologians humble</h2>
<p>Remember, mental models are true, but also limited. Such is also the case, I would argue, when it comes to theological claims.</p>
<p>When we make a claim about who God is or what God has done, we are, in effect, proposing a theological Mental Model.</p>
<p>If the model is worthwhile, then it will be true. And we can test its truthfulness on the basis of Scripture (and tradition, reason, and experience – in that order of significance).</p>
<p>However, no matter how worthwhile the model is, it will always be limited! It will never FULLY suffice to PERFECTLY describe the Truth with a capital T.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should remain humble both when (1) proposing or (2) critiquing theological Mental Models.</p>
<h2 id="2-mental-models-could-help-keep-theologians-creative">2. Mental models could help keep theologians creative.</h2>
<p>Because no single model can account for everything about the person and work of the Triune God, there is always more work to be done!</p>
<p>New models need to be proposed. Old models need to be critiqued, refined, and distilled.</p>
<p>This is why the theological conversation continues. We don’t just “arrive” at a list of correct theological positions. Instead, we delve deeper into the mysteries of God.</p>
<h2 id="3-mental-models-could-help-introduce-theology-to-others">3. Mental models could help introduce theology to others.</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest, theology can be quite confusing. One could easily wonder what all the theological fuss is about. Theologians have been arguing with each other for thousands of years. Why haven’t we figured everything out yet?</p>
<p>Thinking of and presenting theology in terms of a latticework of theological models might be a helpful way forward, because it helps to make it clear why the theological enterprise is ongoing. It could also help people to evaluate and adopt various theological statements/positions on their own.</p>
<h2 id="4-mental-models-could-help-us-talk-about-the-history-of-theology-and-the-church">4. Mental models could help us talk about the history of theology and the Church.</h2>
<p>This is, perhaps, a corollary of the previous point. The history of theology and the Church can be quite confusing. How are we supposed to keep track of all the different figures and theological statements?</p>
<p>Thinking of theology in terms of mental models might help to clarify the discussion a bit. This is already done in many areas of theology, especially when it comes to learning the different “theories” of the atonement.</p>
<p>I think, however, that there’s room to expand the use of theological models throughout all of the different doctrines and figures in the history of theology. For example, when teaching someone about Martin Luther, we could emphasize an important “model” that Luther “discovered” – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_two_kinds_of_righteousness">the distinction between passive and active righteousness</a>.</p>
<p>I realize that this is already being done, but perhaps there’s room to make “theological mental models” (or “theological models”) more of a thoroughgoing model/framework for theology as a whole.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share with you the following prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas Before Study, based on &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Varia/CreatorIneff.html&#34;&gt;Oratio S. Thomae Aquinatis ante studium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which Thomas Aquinas would pray before studying, writing, or preaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prayed it responsively before class (Patristic and Medieval History and Doctrine) with Dr. Piotr Malysz at Beeson Divinity School, and I’ve since turned back to this prayer often!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-prayer-of-st-thomas-aquinas-before-study&#34;&gt;A Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas Before Study&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O God, Creator of all that is, From the treasures of Your wisdom, You have arrayed the universe with marvelous order, And now govern with skill and might. You are the true fount of light and wisdom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>O God, Creator of all that is, From the treasures of Your wisdom, You have arrayed the universe with marvelous order, And now govern with skill and might. You are the true fount of light and wisdom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pour forth a ray of Your brightness Into the darkened places of our minds; Disperse from our souls the twofold darkness into which we were born: Sin and ignorance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grant to each of us: Deftness of hand, Keenness of mind, Skill in learning, Subtlety to interpret, And eloquence in speech.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And since you have given us the privilege to share in the loving, healing, reconciling mission of Your Son Jesus Christ, our Lord, in this age and wherever we are,</strong></p>

<p><strong>So that we will be Strong in faith, Discerning in proclamation, Courageous in witness, Persistent in good deeds.</strong></p>

      <title>3 Questions to Ask When You Study the Bible (Plus a Worksheet!)</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/questions-to-ask-when-you-study-bible/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-studying-the-bible-can-quickly-feel-overwhelming&#34;&gt;The Problem: Studying the Bible can Quickly Feel Overwhelming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right? Even with helpful books out there like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2DQ55nt&#34;&gt;How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (that’s an affiliate link, by the way, meaning that I get a small commission at no cost to you if you end up buying the book), there are still so many potential questions to ask of any biblical text when we study it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are we supposed to keep questions of authorship, genre, meaning, application, etc. etc. straight when we study the Bible?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-problem-studying-the-bible-can-quickly-feel-overwhelming">The Problem: Studying the Bible can Quickly Feel Overwhelming</h2>
<p>Right? Even with helpful books out there like <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2DQ55nt">How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth</a></em> (that’s an affiliate link, by the way, meaning that I get a small commission at no cost to you if you end up buying the book), there are still so many potential questions to ask of any biblical text when we study it.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to keep questions of authorship, genre, meaning, application, etc. etc. straight when we study the Bible?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-solution-ask-these-3-questions-of-any-bible-passage-you-read-and-study">The Solution: Ask These 3 Questions of Any Bible Passage You Read and Study</h2>
<p>No, I didn’t come up with these on my own. To give credit where credit is due: I heard them at Beeson Divinity School from Dr. Allen Ross. Also, a quick web search leads to <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/an-interview-with-gerald-bray-what-questions-should-we-ask-of-a-biblical-text/">this 2009 interview of Dr. Gerald Bray</a> (also a Beeson professor!)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-what-does-this-passage-teach-us-about-god">1. What Does this Passage Teach Us About God?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Who is God?</li>
<li>What is God like?</li>
<li>What has God done?</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of your observations. You’ll add to this as we go along.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-what-does-this-passage-teach-us-about-us-human-beings">2. What Does this Passage Teach Us about Us Human Beings?</h2>
<p>As if the first question wasn’t broad enough, this question can feel overwhelmingly broad and vague. So, to add structure, here are two distinct things to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What were we meant to be? How were we supposed to live?</li>
<li>What has gone wrong? How has sin corrupted that original vision of what it means to be a human?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, sometimes a passage will emphasize one of these things more than the other, but you should usually be able to extrapolate and answer both questions, regardless of what kind of passage you’re looking at.</p>
<p>For example, if a particular passage is emphasizing the fact that people lie all the time (answering the “What has gone wrong?” question), then you can extrapolate and answer the “What were we meant to be?” question: We were meant to tell the truth!</p>
<p>Again, make a list of your answers to these questions. Add it to your previous list of observations about God.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-what-does-this-passage-teach-us-about-how-we-are-supposed-to-respond-to-god">3. What Does This Passage Teach Us About How We Are Supposed to Respond to God?</h2>
<p>OK, here’s where the rubber meets the road. But, again, this question can feel pretty vague/broad, so here are sub-questions to add structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>What has God done to address what has gone wrong?</li>
<li>What does God expect of us in light of this?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, you should be able to use your answers to the first two questions to help you answer this third question.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, however, you’ll find that the passage itself doesn’t explicitly say much about this third question.</strong> In that case, it is legitimate to <strong>extrapolate</strong> based on the rest of the Bible.</p>
<p>That is, say your passage doesn’t mention Jesus, but Jesus is in fact how God has addressed the human problem in your passage (protip: this is VERY OFTEN the case!) It’s legitimate to think and take some notes about how God’s entire mission of redemption and salvation addressed the particular sin problem that your passage focuses on.</p>
<p><strong>Take care when doing so, however!</strong> This is why it’s so important to know the entirety of the Good Story of God as found in Scripture. The more familiar we become with the entire narrative, the easier it becomes to make sense of each particular passage!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="heres-an-example-of-how-to-tie-this-all-together-a-bible-study-worksheet">Here’s an example of how to tie this all together: A Bible Study Worksheet</h2>
<p>I hope you have found these three questions helpful. If you’re interested, here’s an example of how you might create a simple worksheet for a passage of Scripture.</p>

      <title>5 Books Every Christian Should Read</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/5-books-every-christian-read/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 03:59:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/5-books-every-christian-read/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, OK. I get it. Claiming that every Christian should read these 5 books is a bold claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, honestly, I think that these reading recommendations stand up to the scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wracking my brain trying to come up with just the top 5 books that a busy Christian should read if she wants to learn the essentials about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Productivity and Time Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bible Study&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I think I’ve arrived at a pretty good shortlist if I do say so myself. If you &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/understand-remember-read-4-questions-ask-reading-book/&#34;&gt;read and understand&lt;/a&gt; these 5 books, you’ll be well on your way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I’ve been wracking my brain trying to come up with just the top 5 books that a busy Christian should read if she wants to learn the essentials about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Productivity and Time Management</li>
<li>Bible Study</li>
<li>Theology</li>
</ul>
<p>And, I think I’ve arrived at a pretty good shortlist if I do say so myself. If you <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/understand-remember-read-4-questions-ask-reading-book/">read and understand</a> these 5 books, you’ll be well on your way.</p>
<p>Please note that all links to books below are Amazon Affiliate links. That means that, if you buy the product after clicking on the link, I’ll receive a little bit of money in exchange. It helps me keep the lights on. You’re more than welcome, of course, to go to Amazon.com and search for the books, in which case I will not get a commission.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Even if I don’t get paid, I believe that these books are helpful and I think you should read them!</p>
<h1 id="5-books-every-christian-should-read">5 Books Every Christian Should Read</h1>
<h3 id="1-a-study-bible">1. A Study Bible</h3>
<p>That’s right, a study Bible is my single top recommendation for a Christian’s personal library. That’s because a good study Bible will combine the resources of an entire library into a single volume to help you better understand Scripture as you read it. There are, of course, a TON of study Bibles out there. My personal favorite is <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2DX8phs">The ESV Study Bible</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If the ESV Study Bible doesn’t look like what you need, consider <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2G1ysEJ">The CEB Study Bible</a></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="2-gordon-d-fee-and-douglas-stuart-how-to-read-the-bible-for-all-its-worthhttpamznto2g0rupp-fourth-edition">2. Gordon D. Fee and Douglas Stuart, <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2G0rUpP">How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth</a></strong> (Fourth Edition)</h3>
<p>Although most study Bibles will contain short guides on how to read and study the Bible, Fee and Stuart’s book (now in its fourth edition) is somewhat of an industry standard in teaching people how to interpret Scripture. They will take you through:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Need to Interpret the Bible</li>
<li>The Basics of Bible Translation(s) and How to Pick One</li>
<li>How to Study Various Bible Genres:
<ul>
<li>Epistles</li>
<li>Old Testament Narratives</li>
<li>Acts</li>
<li>Gospels</li>
<li>Parables</li>
<li>Law(s)</li>
<li>Prophets</li>
<li>Psalms</li>
<li>Wisdom Literature</li>
<li>Revelation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, Fee and Stuart include an appendix about how to evaluate and use Bible commentaries! This book will set you up for a lifetime of Bible study. <a href="http://amzn.to/2BF6CKQ">Take up and read!</a></p>
<h3 id="3-bruce-shelley-church-history-in-plain-languagehttpamznto2dxu128-fourth-edition">3. Bruce Shelley, <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2DxU128">Church History in Plain Language</a></strong> (Fourth Edition)</h3>
<p>As Shelley notes in the prologue to this volume, “Many Christians today suffer from historical amnesia. The time between the apostles and their own day is one giant blank. That is hardly what God had in mind” (xi). Shelley wrote this book to address this problem.</p>
<p>Now, in seminary, I had to take a “History &amp; Doctrine” sequence of 4 courses that covered the Patristic era through 20th-century Church history and theology. It was amazing, but who’s got that kind of time, right?! So, I asked around, including some of my former college and seminary theology profs, searching for the best, accessible, single-volume overview of the history of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>This book received the most votes by far. And I can see why.</p>
<p>Shelley’s book (also now in its fourth edition, which is a good sign!) manages to cover from the time of Jesus to the present day in approximately 500 pages. Yes, it’s a long book, but there’s a lot to cover! If you read this book, you’ll go through:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Age of Jesus and the Apostles (6BC – AD 70)</li>
<li>The Age of Catholic Christianity (70-312)</li>
<li>The Age of the Christian Roman Empire (312-590)</li>
<li>The Christian Middle Ages (590-1517)</li>
<li>The Age of the Reformation (1517-1648)</li>
<li>The Age of Reason and Revival (1648-1789)</li>
<li>The Age of Progress (1789-1914)</li>
<li>The Age of Ideologies (1914-1989)</li>
<li>The Age of Global Expansion and Relocation (1900 — )</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I know of no better place to start to learn about the history of the Church if you’re crunched for time. Again: <a href="http://amzn.to/2GuNK4W">take up and read</a>!</p>
<h3 id="4-thomas-oden-classic-christianity-a-systematic-theologyhttpamznto2npexxa">4. Thomas Oden, <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2npeXxa">Classic Christianity: A Systematic Theology</a></strong></h3>
<p>OK, so we’ve covered (1) The Bible, (2) how to read it, and (3) Church history. Now it’s time for the best, accessible, single-volume introduction to Christian theology.</p>
<p>This was harder to narrow down. After all, there are plenty of introductions to theology and systematic (think “a comprehensive system”) theologies out there. What makes one better than any of the others?</p>
<p>Well, as far as I know, Oden’s book is different than any other systematic theology out there because he gives you a “consensus view of the Christian faith.” That is, instead of giving you <em>his</em> particular take on Christian theology, he’s attempting to give you the Christian theology upon which there was widespread agreement throughout the first 15 or so centuries of Church history.</p>
<p>The inside cover of the book claims that it “provides the best synthesis of the whole history of Christian thought.” Even though that’s a bold claim, I’m inclined to believe it, based upon the systematic theologies I’ve encountered in my academic research.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2BF1GWu">I strongly recommend you buy and read Oden</a>, obviously. However, if, for some reason, Oden seems too long or expensive, check out Alister McGrath’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2EpfFmn">Theology: The Basics</a> or Daniel Migliore’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2FvyuUm">Faith Seeking Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Theology (Third Edition)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="5-matthew-perman-whats-best-next-span-classa-size-large-idproducttitlehow-the-gospel-transforms-the-way-you-get-things-donespanhttpamznto2dnczma">5. Matthew Perman, <a href="http://amzn.to/2DNCzma"><strong>What’s Best Next:</strong> <span class="a-size-large" id="productTitle"><strong>How the Gospel Transforms the Way You Get Things Done</strong></span></a></h3>
<p>OK, last book of my top 5! And it’s a good one. In fact, this is the single best book on productivity and time management for Christians that I know of. It got me started on my kick of reading productivity books for the past few years, and I trust that it will help you create more margin in your life to pursue purpose and meaning.</p>
<p>Perman begins the book with an argument for why we need a uniquely Christian view of productivity. From there, he covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making God Supreme in Our Productivity</li>
<li>Gospel-Driven Productivity: A New Way to Look at Getting Things Done</li>
<li>D.A.R.E.
<ul>
<li>Define: Know What’s Most Important</li>
<li>Architect: Create a Flexible Structure</li>
<li>Reduce: Free Up Your Time for What’s Most Important</li>
<li>Execute: Do What’s Most Important</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Living This Out</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a profoundly useful and useable book! As a productivity guru, Perman naturally ends each chapter with what he calls “The Box” – a summary section containing the core point and core passage of the chapter, further resources, and suggestions for immediate application.</p>
<p>There’s also a 500 word summary of the book at the end, followed by a helpful topical index and suggestions for further reading – including some of the “classic” works in productivity and time management which, if you’re like me, you’ll want to track down!</p>
<p>If you want to become more productive and manage your time better for the glory of Jesus Christ, <a href="http://amzn.to/2DOtMjQ">buy and read Perman’s book</a>.</p>

      <title>An 80/20 Approach to the Christian Life: 2 Reasons Why Christians Should Care About the Pareto Principle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you want to live a more meaningful and purposeful Christian life, but you feel like it’s hard enough just to get everything done on your to-do list each day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m right there with you! That’s why I’ve made “&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/category/productivity-and-time-management/&#34;&gt;Get Your Act Together (Productivity and Time Management)&lt;/a&gt;” the first of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/start-here/&#34;&gt;Steps to Find Purpose and Meaning in Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I think I’ve found something that can help. I’d like to introduce you to the “&lt;strong&gt;Pareto Principle&lt;/strong&gt;,” also known as “&lt;strong&gt;the 80/20 Rule&lt;/strong&gt;,” the “law of the vital few,” or the “principle of factor sparsity,” if you want to get all technical about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to live a more meaningful and purposeful Christian life, but you feel like it’s hard enough just to get everything done on your to-do list each day?</p>
<p>I’m right there with you! That’s why I’ve made “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/category/productivity-and-time-management/">Get Your Act Together (Productivity and Time Management)</a>” the first of my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/start-here/">Steps to Find Purpose and Meaning in Life</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I think I’ve found something that can help. I’d like to introduce you to the “<strong>Pareto Principle</strong>,” also known as “<strong>the 80/20 Rule</strong>,” the “law of the vital few,” or the “principle of factor sparsity,” if you want to get all technical about it.</p>
<h3 id="put-as-simply-as-possible-the-8020-rule-says-this-80-of-effects-come-from-20-of-causes">Put as simply as possible, the 80/20 rule says this: 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.</h3>
<p>Take a moment to think about this, and it becomes obvious that the 80/20 principle is at play all over the place.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard someone say that 80% of the money/work in a church comes from just 20% of the congregation? 80% of sales come from 20% of clients? As long as you don’t get hung up on exact percentages and allow the principle to be a ballpark estimator/lens, you can see the Pareto Principle at work in several different areas of life, from agriculture to economics.</p>
<p>Here’s a helpful video if you’d like to learn more about the 80/20 Rule:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V28B_xOJzK4?start=51&feature=oembed" title="How to Instantly Be More Productive – The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch" width="750"></iframe>
<h3 id="performing-an-8020-analysis--determining-which-20-of-things-are-responsible-for-80-of-the-results">Performing an “80/20 Analysis” = Determining which 20% of things are responsible for 80% of the results.</h3>
<p>This works both positively and negatively. Right? 20% of the people you spend time with are responsible for 80% of the positive emotions and experiences. But 20% of the people you spend time with are also responsible for 80% of the negative emotions in your life.</p>
<p>20% of the things you spend your time doing are responsible for 80% of the outcomes – both positively and negatively.</p>
<p>This means that you can make some pretty drastic changes in your life by zeroing in on the correct 20%! Eliminating the bad 20% and focusing on increasing the good 20% can quickly turn your life around.</p>
<p>Doing an 80/20 analysis in various areas of your life can save you a bunch of time, because you’re maximizing your efforts by prioritizing the changes you make.</p>
<p>The 80/20 Rule is, therefore, understandably a pretty popular concept. (Google “80/20 Rule” and you’ll see what I mean!) If you’d like to learn more about it, consider picking up Richard Koch’s classic book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2BEFj3k">The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less</a>. (Heads up: that’s an affiliate link. If you end up buying that book, I earn a small commission, at no extra cost to you.)</p>
<p>However, I’m convinced that there are two reasons why Christians in particular should care about the 80/20 Principle.</p>
<h1 id="2-reasons-why-christians-should-care-about-the-8020-pareto-principle">2 Reasons Why Christians Should Care about the 80/20 Pareto Principle</h1>
<h2 id="1-it-could-be-deadly-to-your-christian-life">1. It could be deadly to your Christian life.</h2>
<p>That’s right, I think that, if it’s misused, the Pareto Principle can be deadly for your walk with God.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, if you allow “the world” to calibrate your 80/20 analysis, then you will end up frequently overlooking the things that God cares about — the things that God wants YOU to care about.</p>
<p>Do you think that loving your enemies, caring for the poor, turning the other cheek, and loving the unlovely are going to show up at the top of your 80/20 analysis if you’re not allowing your head and your heart to be shaped by the gospel – by the Good Story of God? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>So, Christians should care about the 80/20 Rule because, if we use it incorrectly, it might end up making us less effective for the Kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 id="2-it-could-change-your-christian-life-for-the-better">2. It could change your Christian life for the better.</h2>
<p>However, just because a principle can be misused doesn’t mean you should use it!</p>
<p>(Also, technically, the Pareto Principle is at work, even if you’re not choosing to capitalize on it! So, there’s no sense in ignoring it!)</p>
<p>As long as we allow our perspectives to be shaped by the Gospel, Christians can profitably use the 80/20 Principle to become more effective, healthy, and whole for the Kingdom of God. There’s no reason not to use this tool.</p>
<h1 id="performing-an-8020-analysis-on-your-christian-life">Performing an 80/20 Analysis on Your Christian Life</h1>
<p>Take advantage of the Pareto Principle by applying it to your walk with God. Think about it with me:</p>
<h3 id="what-20-of-people-things-and-habits-are-drawing-you-80-farther-away-from-god">What 20% of People, Things, and Habits are Drawing You 80% Farther Away from God?</h3>
<p>What people/places/things/actions are responsible for the vast majority of your spiritual decline?</p>
<p>Is it your phone? Social media? Pornography? An old friend who is clearly influencing you more in a negative direction than you’re influencing them in a positive direction?</p>
<p>You need to prioritize your time, your efforts, and your prayers to <strong>decreasing</strong> these things. Even taking just one of these “worst offenders” out of your life could make a huge difference.</p>
<h3 id="what-20-of-people-things-and-habits-are-drawing-you-80-closer-to-god">What 20% of People, Things, and Habits are Drawing You 80% Closer to God?</h3>
<p>What people/places/things/actions are responsible for the vast majority of your spiritual growth?</p>
<p>Is it going to church regularly? Getting up early to read your Bible and pray? Finding and spending time with a trusted spiritual mentor?</p>
<p>You need to prioritize your time, your efforts, and your prayers to <strong>increasing</strong> these things. Doing so will have an outsized impact on your spiritual life.</p>
<h3 id="remember-you-cant-do-this-alone">Remember, YOU Can’t Do This Alone</h3>
<p>No, of course, we can’t “fix ourselves” on our own!</p>
<p>We desperately need the life-transforming ministry of the Holy Spirit to make these kinds of changes in our lives. And God doesn’t love us based on how well we do an 80/20 analysis (praise God!).</p>
<p>But still, it helps to have a clearer idea of where to focus in terms of having a closer relationship with God and others. And I believe that the 80/20 Rule can help us get more clarity.</p>
<h1 id="coming-soon-an-8020-approach-to-productivity-time-management-bible-study-and-theology">Coming Soon: An 80/20 Approach to Productivity, Time Management, Bible Study, and Theology</h1>
<p>There’s another reason why I’m bringing up the 80/20 Rule. This principle will guide my future posts about</p>
<ul>
<li>Productivity</li>
<li>Time Management</li>
<li>Bible Study</li>
<li>Theology</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Because I’m not convinced that anyone needs to learn 100% or even 80% about these topics before they move forward. Attempting to do so will frequently lead to paralysis and indecision, instead of growth.</p>
<p>Instead, it pays off to begin with the most effective 20% of the information in each topic area. And that’s what I’m going to focus on in the weeks ahead.</p>

      <title>The Hermeneutical Implications of Scripture&#39;s Theological Location</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theological &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics&#34;&gt;hermeneutics&lt;/a&gt; – human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God – faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Theological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a> – human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God – faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?</p>
<p>In what follows, I propose that <strong>we can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture’s theological location regarding its subject matter – the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself.</strong></p>
<p>In the first section, I will argue that the Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture’s role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God’s people. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God’s people, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.</p>
<p>Once we clarify the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic.</p>
<p>In the second section, therefore, I maintain that, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads: the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. My approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. Nevertheless, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of <em>all</em> authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Finally, in the third section, I offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. This has, I believe, implications for how the contested and contentious fields of biblical theology and the theological interpretation of Scripture ought to relate to each other. Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.</p>

<h1 id="a-id1ascriptures-theological-location"><a id="1"></a>SCRIPTURE’S THEOLOGICAL LOCATION</h1>
<p>The admittedly diverse texts that make up the Old and New Testaments of Christian Scripture bear witness to a single unified narrative – a sequence of events with its own dramatic coherence and sense – of the triune God’s creation and redemption of the world.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Crucially, Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture’s authoritative role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God’s people.</p>
<p><em><strong>(Note: For a related account of Scripture, read my previous essay: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/on-scripture/">Scripture: What It Is and Why It Matters</a>.)</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="scriptures-subject-matter-the-story-to-which-it-bears-witness">Scripture’s Subject Matter: The Story to Which It Bears Witness</h2>
<p>What is the story to which Scripture bears witness? It is the story of the identity and acts of God.</p>

<p>Granted, a common objection to the doctrine of the Trinity is the claim that it nowhere appears in the pages of Scripture. And indeed, despite the favorite trinitarian “proof-texts” in which Father, Son, and Spirit appear together, “no doctrine of the Trinity in the Nicene sense is present in [even] the New Testament.”<a href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>However, as Jenson persuasively argues, “the doctrine of the Trinity is indeed in Scripture, <em>if</em> one abandons modernity’s notion that statement in so many words as formulated is the only way that a doctrine can appear there.”<a href="#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Instead, the <em>narrative</em> of Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.”<a href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> These three <em>dramatis personae Dei</em>, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a <em>persona</em> in Israel’s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.”<a href="#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
<p>YHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the Father by virtue of Jesus’ address of him as such.<a href="#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The Son is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address, but also in light of passages such as Psalm 2, appropriated in Hebrews 1 to identify Jesus as the divine Son.<a href="#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Finally, the Spirit appears as a <em>persona</em> of the story, first in the Old Testament as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the New Testament as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church.<a href="#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
<p>To say the very least, the classical formulation of the Trinity did not arise from a scriptural vacuum. So much for Scripture’s witness to the triune <em>identity</em> of God.</p>
<h3 id="regarding-gods-acts-scripture-bears-witness-to-the-narrative-of-gods-creation-and-redemption-of-a-people-unto-perfect-fellowship-with-himself">Regarding God’s <em>acts</em>, Scripture bears witness to the narrative of God’s creation and redemption of a people unto perfect fellowship with himself.</h3>
<p>Admittedly, there are ways of improving upon the common “creation – fall – redemption – consummation” framework for summarizing the story or “theo-drama” to which Scripture bears witness.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> However, as long as it is emphasized that redemption includes Israel, Jesus, and the Church, I think that this four-part framework is sufficient for our purposes.</p>
<p>At creation, God extends the fellowship he has eternally enjoyed as Trinity outward to that which is not God, especially to human beings, his “image-bearers,” who were to extend his rule and reign throughout creation (Gen. 1-2). However, at the fall, humans reject both the Creator and their creaturely vocation, rupturing fellowship between God and humanity, between humanity and itself, and between humanity and the rest of creation (Gen. 3).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, God does not abandon creation to exile and decay, but rather redeems it. God calls Abraham and the nation of Israel back to unity with himself through covenant. He endeavors to pull them – and through them as a priestly nation, the world – back from the ruptured relationships into covenantal fellowship and oneness.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> However, the faithless Israelites repeatedly eschew the loving faithfulness of their God, leading to the exile of the nation.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>At the incarnation, the Trinity stretches through the Son to meet all humanity – as a Jewish man in the midst of Israel – in its state of partial exile, to fulfill the global mission of Israel.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> As God enters our midst as Jesus Christ, he pushes us to the side in our perverted attempts to secure our own existence. Without succumbing to sin’s siren call, he is fully affected by it, bringing sinful human nature into the life of God and thereby intensifying the divine reaction against it into an ultimate tension. The one ultimately worthy <em>to</em> exile is now also the one ultimately worthy <em>of</em> exile.</p>
<p>At the cross, the Trinity stretches to the utmost, as the Son of God, worthy to mete out the sentence of exile, instead goes into exile – into the far country of the grave – bearing the consequences of sin for the sake of humanity’s salvation.</p>
<p>At the death of Christ, the Trinity has stretched to its limit, and yet humanity is left in a state of partial exile as before. However, through the power of the Holy Spirit, the exiled Son of God is vindicated as the Savior of the world and brought back from the far country of death.</p>
<p>Through this movement of the Son into the utmost exile and back again, sin itself is offered up to destruction. And crucially, all humanity who is united to him by grace through faith – everyone who is therefore in Christ – gets caught up with the Son in his return to the eternal life and love of the Triune God.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<h2 id="scriptures-role-in-the-story-to-which-it-bears-witness">Scripture’s Role in the Story to Which It Bears Witness</h2>
<p>Having summarized the story to which Scripture bears witness, we now turn to Scripture’s authoritative role in the story. What authority does Scripture have in the story, and what function/role does it play? I will attempt to answer these questions by explaining the relationships between (1) Scripture and God, (2) Scripture and creation, and (3) Scripture and God’s people, the Church.</p>
<h3 id="scripture-and-god">Scripture and God</h3>
<p>With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. But what does it mean for Scripture to be inspired by God? I agree with Henry’s definition of inspiration as “a supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on divinely chosen agents in consequence of which their writings become trustworthy and authoritative.”<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> However, I would add that the writings are specifically trustworthy and authoritative toward the divine ends of revelation and redemption. That is, God inspires human authors to communicate his word to human audiences for the sake of fellowship and communion with them.</p>
<p>The authority of Scripture, then, rests in its divine provenance. As Webster rightly states, “Scripture is authoritative because it is instrumental in bringing the word of God to bear upon the thought and practices of the church.”<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> Or, as Vanhoozer summarizes it, “the Bible not only reports the word of God but is itself a form of the divine address.”<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> In this way, the triune God makes himself verbally present to his creatures through Holy Scripture. The Bible, therefore, plays an authoritative role in the story to which it bears witness, because it is God’s own witness to his own identity and acts.</p>
<h3 id="scripture-and-creation">Scripture and Creation</h3>
<p>With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. I will have more to say about this below (see “Theological Hermeneutics: Both Special and General”). For now, it is enough to note that it is impossible to take up a perspective completely outside of the story to which Scripture bears witness, for the story encompasses all created space and time, as well as their origins and ends. Though Scripture plays a distinct role in the story, as opposed to other created realities, whether trees or thermodynamics, it is inherently related to the rest of creation – especially to God’s people.</p>
<h3 id="scripture-and-gods-people">Scripture and God’s People</h3>
<p>The story of Scripture includes and is intertwined with the story of God’s people, beginning with the story of Israel, and then, through Jesus the Messiah, the culmination of Israel’s story, continuing into the story of the Church.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> For this reason, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.</p>
<p>While certain accounts of the canonization of Scripture make it sound like the Church (rather arbitrarily) selected certain texts and deemed them authoritative, theologically-speaking, it is the other way around. As Webster rightly maintains, “the process of canonization is properly to be understood, not as an act in which the church creates an authority for itself by determining a set of normative texts, but as an act of acknowledging antecedent authority imposed upon the church from without.”<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> In fact, although the Church undoubtedly had a role to play in the canonization of Scripture (just as human authors had a role to play in the writing of Scripture), Scripture, as God’s word, creates and sustains the Church.<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>I agree with Watson’s claim that Gadamer’s concept of <em>Wirkungsgeschichte</em> is theologically helpful in describing the relationship between Scripture and Church. The Church can be viewed as the <em>Wirkungsgeschichte</em> – the “effective-history” – of Scripture. The text of Scripture exerts initiatory agency on the Church, and the Church exerts responsive agency on Scripture.<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a> Of course, the Gadamerian concept on its own does not replace the necessary constant guidance of the interaction between Church and Scripture by the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, it can help to clarify how this interaction takes place.</p>
<p>In summary, Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. It is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. Furthermore, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And finally, Scripture is irreducibly ecclesiological.</p>
<h1 id="a-id2atheological-hermeneutics-special-and-general"><a id="2"></a>THEOLOGICAL HERMENEUTICS: SPECIAL AND GENERAL</h1>
<p>Having clarified the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic. To the first relationship we now turn. Properly understood, theological hermeneutics is both a special and a general hermeneutic.<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within the story of its subject matter, theological hermeneutics is a <em>special</em> hermeneutic. That is, we do not read Scripture exactly like any other book, because Scripture is unlike all other books to the extent that it is the inspired and authoritative word of the triune God, used to reveal himself and redeem his people unto fellowship with himself. Given the explicitly theological subject matter of Scripture, it is ill-advised to attempt to shoehorn Scripture into a general hermeneutic that is designed to work apart from a theological perspective. Although some may accuse such an explicitly theological approach as “special pleading,” I maintain that a special, theological hermeneutic of Scripture is necessary to interpret Scripture according to its subject matter.</p>
<p>Does this mean, then, that theological hermeneutics becomes a ghettoized discipline? Not necessarily. Because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, theological hermeneutics is also a <em>general</em>/universal hermeneutic. Indeed, it will only appear like a disciplinary ghetto to the extent that one has not yet been shaped by Scripture’s subject matter.</p>
<p>I am in agreement with Jenson’s claim that “we read the relation between the strange world the Bible opens and our familiar world the wrong way around, and so are in a hopeless situation from the start.”<a href="#_ftn22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> He continues: “When the Bible lacks force in the church,” (and, I would add, in the academy!), “it is regularly — from the time of the apostles to post-Christendom — because we presume that the ‘real’ world is some other world than the one that opens in the Bible, and that what we have to do is figure out how to make the Bible effective in the putatively ‘real’ world.” This is an ill-fated enterprise, for “the Bible is in fact ineffective and irrelevant in our so-called ‘real’ world, because the Bible does not acknowledge that our ‘real’ world deserves the adjective.”<a href="#_ftn23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>
<p>Because the story to which Scripture bears witness is the story of the real world, theological hermeneutics is a general and universal hermeneutic.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-the-hermeneutical-triads">Implications for the Hermeneutical Triads</h2>
<p>This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads, the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis.</p>
<p>My approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance, for they determine how we ought to interpret everything else, including historical and literary analysis, as well as all other authors, texts, and readers.</p>
<p>Does this mean, then, that theology <em>dominates</em> all other disciplines? Will we quickly find ourselves insisting upon a puritanical regulative principle as the standard of human knowledge, rejecting claims to knowledge of anything – whether physical quarks or human quirks – not mentioned in the pages of the Bible?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily. For, although I maintain that theology is, as it were, the queen of the sciences, she is a kindly ruler. That is, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of <em>all</em> authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, plenty of Scriptural teaching would seem to suggest that theological “insiders” must remain intellectually humble, open to the possibility that theological “outsiders,” whether methodological naturalists or adherents of other religions, might have much to teach them about the world.<a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> As Treier notes, “often non-Christian interpreters will understand – that is, develop various capacities for communicative action in relation to – texts far better than Christians will.”<a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> This takes nothing away from the authority or scope of Scripture or its subject matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, although some readers may object to the extent to which I am willing to give theology explicit priority over all other disciplines of human understanding, I would answer that doing so actually ends up requiring and resourcing other intellectual disciplines better (from a theological perspective, at least) than they could do so on their own.</p>
<p>In sum, then, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. What does this mean for the relationship between biblical and theological studies? Should they be one discipline or two (or more)?</p>
<h1 id="a-id3abiblical-and-theological-studies-a-multifaceted-discipline"><a id="3"></a>BIBLICAL AND THEOLOGICAL STUDIES: A MULTIFACETED DISCIPLINE</h1>
<p>Given the enormity and the importance of Scripture’s subject matter, I here offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.</p>
<h2 id="biblical-and-theological-studies-need-each-other">Biblical and Theological Studies Need Each Other</h2>
<p>Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. In many churchly circles, this assertion would not be met with much resistance. However, in the (modern) academy, biblical and theological studies have been kept increasingly separate. Since the academy is the sphere in which biblical and(/or) theological studies is/are located as (an) academic discipline/s (see how confusing this gets?), we must reckon with the academic division.</p>
<p>In their survey of the “original unity and subsequent separation” of biblical studies and systematic theology, Rowe and Hays helpfully observe that the separation of the two disciplines is a relatively recent phenomenon.<a href="#_ftn26">[26]</a> Indeed, they (approximately) trace the modern division to the eighteenth century, paradigmatically to J.P. Gabler’s 1787 inaugural address regarding the distinction between biblical and dogmatic theology.<a href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> Broadly speaking, in Gabler’s wake, biblical and theological studies have, at worst, ignored each other’s contributions entirely and, at best, functioned as a sort of disciplinary layer-cake, with the results of each discipline being transmitted to the other for separate and subsequent handling.</p>
<p>Is this “layer-cake approach” the best we can hope for? I do not think so. To do justice to their complex, unified, and ecclesiological subject matter, both biblical and theological studies need each other at all stages of the various processes involved in their subdisciplines.</p>
<p>On the biblical studies side of that relationship, I believe that the focus ought to be on the complexity of the Bible’s subject matter. As Rowe and Hayes maintain, the arguments in favor of “the implicit unity between biblical studies and systematic theology…do not preclude an emphasis within biblical studies on the distinctiveness and particularity of the diverse texts [of Scripture].”<a href="#_ftn28">[28]</a> If, as Jenson has suggested, the ultimate test for theology – in both its individual statements and its comprehensive systems – is its success or failure as a hermeneutic for all of Scripture, then one of the tasks of biblical studies is, as it were, to remind theological studies just how difficult of a test it faces, due to the historical and literary complexities of the Bible<img loading="lazy" src="#_ftn29" alt="[29]"  />
</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, theology is required to remind biblical studies that, thought the biblical texts be admittedly varied, they bear witness to a unified and irreducibly ecclesiological narrative, held together by the story’s author and central character, the triune God. After all, even the moniker “biblical” studies, as opposed to, say, “Ancient Near Eastern” or “Greco-Roman” studies, implies “the theological decision that the particular documents that constitute the Bible are in some way related to one another, as distinct from their relation to other pieces of literature, and are therefore to be treated together.” (Though, as Rowe and Hays also note, this does not settle the question of <em>how</em> biblical texts relate to one another.)<a href="#_ftn30">[30]</a></p>
<h2 id="implications-for-biblical-theology-and-the-theological-interpretation-of-scripture">Implications for Biblical Theology and the Theological Interpretation of Scripture</h2>
<p>This seems like the best time to address the contested and contentious fields of biblical theology [BT] and the theological interpretation of Scripture [TIS]. While I do not have much to add to the ongoing discussion that has taken place between, among others, Bockmuehl, Fowl, Klink and Lockett, and Treier, I do think that conceiving biblical and theological studies as a single, multifaceted discipline adds plausibility to Treier’s “middle way” or “Type 3” approach to relating the two disciplines in a distinct-yet-complementary way.<a href="#_ftn31">[31]</a></p>
<p>Although I do not claim that this is the only right way to define BT, I admit that I am predisposed to think of the sub-discipline in terms of what Klink and Lockett call the “BT2: History of Redemption” approach, as practiced by, among many others, D.A. Carson.<a href="#_ftn32">[32]</a> Thus construed, BT’s goal is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to discern the historical progression of God’s work of redemption through an inductive analysis of key themes developing through both discrete corpora and the whole of Scripture. Major themes such as covenant or kingdom constitute the theological connecting fibers between the Old and New Testaments, and these themes necessarily run along a historical trajectory, giving fundamental structure to the theology of the Bible.<a href="#_ftn33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, although I readily admit the difficulties involved in defining TIS, the main difference that seems to emerge between BT (thus construed) and TIS is the latter’s willingness to read the Bible (1) following the example of certain “pre-critical” exegetes, (2) through the creedal lens of the “Rule of Faith,” and (3) within the interpretive community of the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<a href="#_ftn34">[34]</a></p>
<p>I think that BT and TIS can benefit each other as they seek to deal with the subject matter of Scripture.</p>
<p>Without accepting BT’s (occasionally) a-ecclesiological presuppositions, TIS could benefit from BT’s close reading of biblical texts in order to demonstrate the Bible’s coherence on its own terms. How? First, as evidence that churchly interpreters of Scripture, including so-called pre-critical ones, were not wrong to see a unity in Scripture and its subject matter. Second, the various “key themes” of Scripture that BT isolates can provide TIS with profitable areas for further theological research.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BT could use TIS as a reminder that (1) Scripture itself, and not BT’s synthesis of it, is theologically authoritative and that (2) the Bible does not <em>need</em> to be interpreted exclusively on “its own terms,” for the story to which Scripture bears witness extends beyond the Old and New Testaments to incorporate the story of the Church and the rest of creation.</p>
<p>This may not result in a radical change within BT’s or TIS’s explicit methods (or, perhaps in the case of the latter, the lack thereof), but it would hopefully at least result in greater disciplinary humility and appreciation for (1) the theological authority of Scripture itself, apart from either BT’s or TIS’s elucidations of it, and (2) the Holy Spirit’s role(s) in inspiration, preservation, and interpretation of Scripture throughout the history of the Church.</p>
<h2 id="theological-subdisciplines-need-each-other">Theological Subdisciplines Need Each Other</h2>
<p>If biblical and theological studies ought to be a single, multifaceted discipline, how should we construe the relationships between the various <em>theological</em> sub-disciplines?</p>
<p>As Jenson claims, if theology asks (with) the Church: “Wherein was what we heard and saw the gospel?” and “What are we tomorrow to say and enact in order to say and enact this same gospel?”, then <em>historical</em> theology focuses on the former question and <em>normative</em> theology (which encompasses both <em>systematic</em> and <em>pastoral</em> theology) focuses on the latter.<a href="#_ftn35">[35]</a> Jenson continues to distinguish between pastoral theology, which focuses on “the exigencies of the church’s daily task,” and systematic theology, which “takes up questions posed not only by current urgency but also by perceived inherent connections of the faith.”<a href="#_ftn36">[36]</a> And yet, because of the historical way in which both the Church’s exigencies and the faith’s inherent connections have developed, at some point these distinctions perhaps begin to lose their importance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the various theological sub-disciplines need each other as well.</p>
<p>The historical complexity speaks to the need for historical theology, and the conceptual complexity to the need for systematic theology. The relationship between these two sub-disciplines ought to be much the same as that between biblical and theological studies. That is, historical theology, as it were, can remind systematic theology of the historical particularities and complexities involved in attempting to understand, with the Church, the subject matter of Scripture. Systematic theology can remind historical theology of the complex conceptual unity involved in the task, such that, for example, Augustine and Barth can be put into conversation with one another (regarding a variety of theological <em>loci</em>) without doing undue violence to either.</p>
<p>What role does pastoral theology play? Both historical and systematic theology must be reminded that the subject matter of Scripture is an all-encompassing story, one in which we all cannot help but participate. Furthermore, as Charry is right to note, theology is properly salutary and “aretegenic” (“virtue-producing”) – and not merely cognitive – for God reveals and redeems for the sake of human flourishing.<a href="#_ftn37">[37]</a> Pastoral theology, therefore, asks the crucial question: Given our current situation, how do we participate rightly in the all-encompassing story of the triune God? It thereby prevents historical and systematic theology from losing purchase on their subject matter by forgetting that it <em>matters</em> for life as we now live it.</p>
<h1 id="a-idconclusionaconclusionsummary"><a id="conclusion"></a>CONCLUSION/SUMMARY</h1>
<p>Regarding the enterprise of theological hermeneutics, I have argued that we can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture’s theological authoritative location/role regarding its subject matter – the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God’s people, Scripture is irreducibly ecclesiological.</p>
<p>Because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This means that theology is to be given pride of place in both the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, as well as the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. And yet, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of <em>all</em> authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>Finally, I have argued that, given the enormity and importance of Scripture’s subject matter, we ought to conceive of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology – as well as biblical theology and the theological interpretation of Scripture. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a> See foundational covenant passages, such as Gen. 12, 15, throughout the Old Testament.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref11">[11]</a> Consider, for example, the curses for covenantal unfaithfulness found in Deut. 27:14-26; 28:15-68, culminating with the threat of exile.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref12">[12]</a> As Irenaeus and Athanasius proclaimed: “God became what we are so that we might become what He is.”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref13">[13]</a> Cf. 1 Cor 15:20-22. As the nexus of redemption and re-creation, the resurrection is crucial – for the focus of the atonement is not merely to sentence sin with its proper exile, but to fulfill God’s creative purposes for unity and participation in the divine life.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref17">[17]</a> Jenson is, I believe, right to insist on the following: “Whatever hermeneutical gaps may need to be dealt with in the course of the church’s biblical exegesis, there is one that must not be posited or attempted to be dealt with: there is <em>no</em> historical distance between the community in which the Bible appeared and the church that now seeks to understand the Bible, because these are the same community.” Although, of course, there is plenty of historical distance <em>within</em> the community, which must be addressed by both biblical and theological studies.

<p><a href="#_ftnref21">[21]</a> Treier notes that theological hermeneutics can refer to at least two possible projects, the first focused on general hermeneutics and the second focused on special hermeneutics. With some trepidation, due to the numerous complexities involved, I have taken his comment that “the two projects can occur simultaneously” as an invitation to do so. See Daniel J. Treier, <em>Introducing Theological Interpretation of Scripture: Recovering a Christian Practice</em> (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2008), 136; Daniel J.

<p><a href="#_ftnref24">[24]</a> Admittedly, this claim needs a fair amount of theological exegesis to back it up. While I do not have space for thorough argumentation on this point, consider, for example, the lessons that Pharaoh (Gen. 12:18-20) and Abimelech (Gen. 20:8-18) taught Abraham, or the apparent moral and theological superiority of the Ninevite sailors compared to Jonah (Jonah 1:4-16).</p>

      <title>Principles: 10 Imperatives for the Good Life</title>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/principles-10-imperatives-good-life/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why write out a list of principles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, it’s my birthday. And, although I’m only in my twenties, I’m feeling a bit reflective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another, I’ve just been given a copy of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2yQpytf&#34;&gt;Principles: Life and Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2yQpytf&#34;&gt; by Ray Dalio&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dalio (ix),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be aplied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why write out a list of principles?</p>
<p>For one thing, it’s my birthday. And, although I’m only in my twenties, I’m feeling a bit reflective.</p>
<p>For another, I’ve just been given a copy of <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2yQpytf">Principles: Life and Work</a></em><a href="http://amzn.to/2yQpytf"> by Ray Dalio</a> (affiliate link).</p>
<p>According to Dalio (ix),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be aplied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, here are 10 principles I’ve developed so far. I’ve followed Dalio’s lead in casting my principles as imperatives. No, I don’t always do an excellent job at these. But they’re worth striving for.</p>
<p>No, this is not an exhaustive list. And no, I don’t always do an excellent job at these. But they’re worth striving for.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="1-go-to-church-word-amp-sacraments">1. Go to Church: Word &amp; Sacraments</h1>
<p>This principle, and the following one, are purposefully at the top of the list. Why? Because they will place you in a context where your desires, your view of reality, and therefore your principles will be formed in the right direction.</p>
<p>So, go to a church where you can hear the Word of God preached and where you can partake of the Sacraments.</p>

<p>NOTE: I realize that a WHOLE LOT MORE could be said with/underneath these first two “principles.” As an overarching principle, <em><strong>“Become More Like Jesus Christ in All I Think, Feel, Say, and Do,”</strong></em> is quite good. In fact, I’d consider most of the rest of this blog to be relevant in that respect.</p>
<p>However, I’m going to devote the next eight principles to various pragmatic concerns, such as productivity, physical fitness, and financial well-being.</p>

      <title>Testimony: A Faith Story, In Brief</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an attempt to tell my testimony, the story of my Christian faith, in approximately 500 words. It was challenging to do, but also a helpful exercise! I challenge you to write out your own story in approximately 500 words.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;testimony&#34;&gt;Testimony&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as long as I can remember, I have known and followed Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. However, there has been a lingering problem in our relationship – on my end. Of course, this problem is called “sin.” But, I mean an even more specific problem: my struggle to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; Jesus, and not merely to know &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<hr>
<h1 id="testimony">Testimony</h1>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have known and followed Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. However, there has been a lingering problem in our relationship – on my end. Of course, this problem is called “sin.” But, I mean an even more specific problem: my struggle to <em>know</em> Jesus, and not merely to know <em>about</em> Jesus.</p>
<p>(For an attempted summary of the <em>content</em> of my Christian faith, what I believe, see <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2015/12/08/a-crucicentric-credo/">“What Do I Believe? A Cross-Centered Credo.”</a>)</p>
<h2 id="childhood">Childhood</h2>
<p>I have always placed a high premium on knowing and telling the truth. As a precocious five-year-old, an intellectual conundrum led me to ask my father how we could be brothers in Christ, though I was his son.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he did not respond with a merely intellectual explanation, but rather a gospel presentation. I prayed the “Sinner’s Prayer,” and my faith journey since then has been a long lesson that real Truth is not a proposition to comprehend, nor a weapon to wield, but a person to love, trust, and obey.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have often found it easier to wage intellectual battle than to trust and obey. Knowing all the right answers in Sunday School did little to assuage my pride, lust, anger, and fear.</p>
<p>Thankfully, however, Christ has not given up on me. Instead, through his Word and Church, he has reminded me time and time again that my intellect is to be used in loving, self-sacrificial service – and not in self-defense.</p>
<h2 id="high-school">High School</h2>
<p>In high school, Christ opened my eyes to a world in need and gave me a glimpse of how the gifts he had given me might be used to meet the world’s needs.</p>
<p>However, to my shame, I had devoted more time and effort into learning things like calculus and Spanish than to learning the gospel. For this reason, I decided to devote my undergraduate studies to learning the gospel in order to preach it to others. I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Preseminary Bible just three weeks before classes began.</p>
<h2 id="college">College</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/tag/cedarville/">college</a>, I fell in love with the gospel, with biblical and theological studies, and with a young nursing student who loved Jesus and wanted to use her gifts (medical and otherwise) to serve him.</p>
<p>We decided to follow Christ together as husband and wife. After we were married in 2012, God opened the doors for us to come to Birmingham, AL, where I have continued my pastoral training at Beeson Divinity School and served as a Youth Minister at St. Peter’s Anglican Church. My wife has lovingly cared for the sick and the poor, first as a Registered Nurse, and now as a Nurse Practitioner.</p>
<p>(Want to read my wedding vows? You can do so <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/08/14/wedding-vows/">here</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="seminary-and-beyond">Seminary and Beyond</h2>
<p>Seminary (<a href="https://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>), youth ministry, and my recent ordination to the diaconate have confirmed my pastoral calling. I want to spend the rest of my life serving the world by serving the Church. That is, I want to advance God’s kingdom academically, globally, and pastorally as part professor, missionary, and (primarily a) pastor.</p>
<p>Although merely knowing <em>about</em> Jesus is still a temptation, I know that my Savior is faithful. He can use my life to help heal a world that desperately needs to <em>know</em> him.</p>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;podcasts-an-introduction&#34;&gt;Podcasts: An Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although podcasts (think “iPod” + “broadcast”) have been around for over a decade, we’re living in a bit of a golden age – or a least a Rennaissance – of the medium. For the uninitiated, here’s a nice video about what podcasts are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oerm5Q&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oerm5Q&lt;/a&gt;_9u2A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, podcasts are one of my very favorite ways to consume information about a wide variety of topics. Sure, gun to my head, I’ll choose books over podcasts as a way to learn. However, unlike books (or videos), you can easily listen to podcasts while doing other things – whether folding laundry, washing dishes, or going for a run/walk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Currently, podcasts are one of my very favorite ways to consume information about a wide variety of topics. Sure, gun to my head, I’ll choose books over podcasts as a way to learn. However, unlike books (or videos), you can easily listen to podcasts while doing other things – whether folding laundry, washing dishes, or going for a run/walk.</p>
<p>(Note: as I mentioned in <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/tools">my list of favorite tools and apps</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> is my current favorite podcast player. Although, there are plenty of other worthy podcast players/managers to check out!)</p>
<p>There are no shortage of podcasts, or lists of best podcasts, for that matter. However, here are my current favorites.</p>
<h1 id="my-favorite-podcasts">My Favorite Podcasts:</h1>
<h2 id="up-first-nprhttpwwwnprorgpodcasts510318up-first"><a href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first">Up First (NPR)</a></h2>
<p>This is the first podcast I listen to every weekday while making coffee. I love that it’s short (˜10 minutes) and that it provides some snapshots of important news stories that day. In addition to Up First, I frequently listen to NPR newscasts via their <a href="http://one.npr.org/">NPR One app</a>, which is worth checking out!</p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-manlinesshttpwwwartofmanlinesscompodcast"><a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/">The Art of Manliness</a></h2>
<p>Sure, the egalitarian in me wishes there were a show out there called “The Art of Humanity” – about how to be a <em>Mensch.</em> However, in the meantime, Brett McKay has a solid podcast going about “reviving the lost art of manliness.” I enjoy the podcast (and t<a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/">he Art of Manliness website</a>) because it includes so many helpful how-to guides – for everything from weightlifting to men’s fashion.</p>
<h2 id="word-amp-tablehttpswordandtablesimplecastfm"><a href="https://wordandtable.simplecast.fm/">Word &amp; Table</a></h2>
<p>I created <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">Rookie Anglican</a> as a way of making Anglicanism more accessible. This podcast, Word &amp; Table, has much the same mission, although it’s focus is not just on Anglicanism, but rather on the rich Christian tradition of liturgical worship. As I wrote about the podcast <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/listen-to-the-word-table-podcast-to-learn-more-about-liturgical-and-sacramental-christian-worship/">over at Rookie Anglican</a>:</p>

<h2 id="the-tim-ferriss-showhttpstimblogpodcast"><a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">The Tim Ferriss Show</a></h2>
<p>I’ve become somewhat of a Tim Ferriss junkie in the past two years. In addition to this podcast – which features long-form interviews with “top performers,” in which Tim distils tips, tricks, habits, and practices for the common person – Ferriss’ books are well worth checking out (Affiliate LInks: <a href="http://amzn.to/2uTWui7">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>; The <a href="http://amzn.to/2uxKdxq">4-Hour Body</a>; The <a href="http://amzn.to/2h0dtJT">4-Hour Chef</a>; <a href="http://amzn.to/2h0dwp3">Tools of Titans</a>) . He’s great at teaching <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning">metalearning</a></em> – how to learn how to learn!</p>
<p>(Note: Tim Ferriss is how I found out about <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/05/25/kettlebell-swings-back-balm-for-the-sedentary-seminarian/">kettlebells</a> – one of my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/tools">favorite tools</a> for personal fitness.)</p>

<p>Sure, Coffee Break German hasn’t taught me the kind of German that I’ll need for my Ph.D. German translation exam. However, it is a very informative introduction to basic/conversational German. It makes a wonderful companion to Duolingo for language learning!

<h2 id="this-american-lifehttpswwwthisamericanlifeorg"><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a></h2>
<p>In my opinion, no podcast beats This American Life in terms of the quality and variety of storytelling. It’s well worth your time, in addition to the “spinoff” shows <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> and <a href="https://stownpodcast.org/">S-Town</a>.</p>

&lt;p&gt;You know, if there’s one thing I hate, it’s goodbyes. Anyone else here hate goodbyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and the fact that I hate them so much means I’m not really very good at goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get awkward and silent. Sometimes I get awkward and really chatty! Heck, sometimes I get awkward and I make poor choices, like the one time when I was getting ready to say goodbye to my family when they dropped me off at college.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="goodbyes-suck">GOODBYES SUCK</h2>
<p>You know, if there’s one thing I hate, it’s goodbyes. Anyone else here hate goodbyes?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the fact that I hate them so much means I’m not really very good at goodbyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get awkward and silent. Sometimes I get awkward and really chatty! Heck, sometimes I get awkward and I make poor choices, like the one time when I was getting ready to say goodbye to my family when they dropped me off at college.</p>
<p>They were looking forward to a final dinner with me, in the school cafeteria, before they left. But I was worried about the awkwardness of saying a tearful goodbye between packed tables and chairs, so I suggested that they just leave.</p>
<p>Let’s just say that my family wasn’t very happy. And me? Neither was I. I ate my first college meal all alone.</p>
<p>Goodbyes suck. And I often suck at goodbyes.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, this is my “goodbye” sermon here at St. Peter’s, and I wanted to give an excuse for this sermon, if it sucks!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I do want to thank this congregation for being such a good place for Rachel and me to serve and grow alongside you. Thank you for loving Rachel and me as our brothers and sisters in Christ. We will miss you all very much as we move to Illinois this week.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don’t want this goodbye to get TOO awkward, so I’d better keep on preaching!</p>
<p><strong>I think that goodbyes are bad because they so often leave our stories unfinished.</strong></p>
<p>And we humans tend to hate unfinished business. It’s so much better when the story has an end! Sometimes, even a bad ending is better than no ending at all!</p>
<p>Think about it, if you’re watching an important game on TV – say, Alabama vs. Auburn – would you rather see the ending, even if your team loses, or have the power go out and completely miss the final minutes?</p>
<p>Stories without endings are frustrating. And that’s why it’s so hard to say goodbye.</p>
<p>That’s why Death – the ultimate goodbye, if you will – is so horrible.</p>
<p>It’s not really an ending, not for those of us who go on living, anyways. Instead, Death leaves our stories hanging, with words left unsaid and promises left unfulfilled.</p>
<p>I think here of parents in Manchester this week who were forced to say goodbye to their children all too soon, thanks to the suicide bombing. Or the Coptic Christians in Egypt forced to say goodbye to their loved ones too soon, thanks to the bus attack.</p>
<p>Goodbyes suck, because they leave our stories unfinished.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-ascension-does-it-suck">WHAT ABOUT THE ASCENSION? DOES IT SUCK?</h2>
<p>Is the Ascension of Jesus Christ, then, just another awful goodbye?</p>
<p>I mean, think about the emotional rollercoaster Christ’s followers must have ridden in those days. Rising hopes of God’s coming kingdom dashed to the ground at the Crucifixion – only to rise once more at the Resurrection!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jesus, you’re alive! Surely, surely now’s the time when you’re going to restore the kingdom to Israel, right?!</p>
<p>“I mean, you had us worried there for a minute, what with the whole executed like a common criminal thing… but SURELY now’s the time!</p>
<p>“Seize the day! Take the throne! Kill these Romans, won’t you?! Won’t you?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… Now, I’m sure that the Ascension was glorious. After all, Luke tells us that the disciples worshiped and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</p>
<p>But the Ascension was still a goodbye.</p>
<p>And I’m sure that, eventually, the glory faded as the disciples gazed into heaven. And they needed the angels’ reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Men of Galilee, who do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven” [Acts 1:11].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so maybe it’s fairer to say that the Ascension was a “see-you-later.”</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>But doesn’t the Ascension still leave things hanging?</p>
<p>Doesn’t it still leave our story – and the story of the Gospel – unfinished?</p>
<p>Well, yes…and no.</p>
<p>If I might paraphrase the angels’ message in Acts 1 as the title of my sermon, here it is:</p>
<p><strong>“It’s finished! So, get to work!”</strong></p>
<p>And here’s my main point:</p>
<p><strong>The Ascension completes the Gospel and compels the Church.</strong></p>
<h1 id="how-does-the-ascension-complete-the-gospel">HOW DOES THE ASCENSION COMPLETE THE GOSPEL?</h1>
<p>How does the Ascension complete the Gospel?</p>
<p>Well, that requires knowing what the Gospel is, so here goes:</p>
<h2 id="the-gospel">THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In the beginning, God created the entire universe to be his temple, his kingdom – the place where he would dwell and rule.</p>
<p>And he created human beings – his image-bearers, his ambassadors, his “middle-management” – to extend his rule and reign throughout creation.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this, however, human beings rebelled against God.</p>
<p>Instead of bowing the knee to the King, they tried to steal his throne.</p>
<p>And this rebellion brought Sin and Death into the kingdom – breaking the relationships</p>
<ul>
<li>between God and humanity,</li>
<li>between humanity and itself,</li>
<li>and between humanity and the rest of creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where once there was perfect fellowship and communion, there was now distance and Exile.</p>
<p>And the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, God was not going to let Sin, Death, and Exile have the final word! No!</p>
<p>He would pursue his people, he would buy them back from their slavery to Sin and Death, he would cleanse them from the inside out, and he would – one day – bring them back home.</p>
<p>The story of God’s rescue mission, then, is the Good News – it’s the Gospel.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the story of Israel is the beginning of this rescue mission.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, God draws a people back into covenant relationship with himself.</p>
<p>And yet, the story of the Old Testament is left hanging on a tragic note.</p>
<p>Despite God’s continuing goodness, faithfulness, and salvation, his people prove stubbornly faithless.</p>
<p>And, even though they technically dwell in the geographical Promised Land, they are still in Exile.</p>
<p>They are still ruled, in the halls of power, by their political enemies. And they are still ruled, in their hearts, by Sin and Death.</p>
<p>And the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, in the New Testament, God HIMSELF goes into Exile INSTEAD OF his people, in order to bring them back home.</p>
<p>I’d like you to picture this as a capital letter “V”.</p>
<p>Up here, you’ve got the eternal Son of God – fully divine.</p>
<p>Down here, is us. Drowning, as it were, in a cesspool of Sin and Death.</p>
<p>And instead of abandoning us…</p>
<p>(Heck, even instead of somehow saving us at an arm’s distance, after we start to clean up and get our act together.)</p>
<p>…Christ dives headfirst into the muck – into the cesspool of sin-stained human existence.</p>
<p>We call this the Incarnation.</p>
<p>So, great! God’s with us! In..this…cesspool! …Great?</p>
<p>At the Crucifixion, Jesus goes all the way to the very bottom point of that capital V.</p>
<p>He goes all the way into the furthest, farthest Exile – Death.</p>
<p>So, great! God’s dead.</p>
<p>How is this good news?!</p>
<p>Well, the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.</p>
<p>Because, you see, he went into the farthest Exile, so that we wouldn’t have to.</p>
<p>And he didn’t stay in the grave. No no no!</p>
<p>There’s another side to the capital V!</p>
<p>We can’t forget the Resurrection!</p>
<p>Jesus arose from the grave – he walked out of that tomb on Easter morning AAAAANNNNND…..</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Well, we don’t know.</p>
<p>He appeared to some people. And then, well, we’re not really sure what happened to him.</p>
<p>We’re not really sure what it all meant.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The story would have ended there, left hanging between tragedy and triumph, were it not for the Ascension.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-ascension-completes-the-gospel">HOW THE ASCENSION COMPLETES THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we can’t forget the Ascension!</p>
<p>The Ascension COMPLETES the Gospel!</p>
<p>The Ascension is the final step in Christ’s return from Exile.</p>
<p>And, if we are united with Christ as a part of his body, the Church, the Ascension is the completion of OUR return from Exile as well!</p>
<p>The Ascension demonstrates that the Crucifixion and Resurrection were the final victory over Sin and Death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that Christ is not only crucified, and not only risen, but also ascended, and glorified, and seated on his heavenly throne means that he is the LORD.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, though still fully human, though still fully acquainted with our many griefs, is not your buddy.</p>
<p>He’s not your pal that you can ignore at your convenience.</p>
<p>No, the Ascension reminds us that Christ is our King.</p>
<p>He is our Lord. And he is to be obeyed.</p>
<p>But, hey, since the capital V is finished, and Christ is on the throne, that means that we can all just sit around and do nothing, right?!</p>
<p>As long as we’re not doing something horrible?</p>
<p>I mean, the story’s OVER! I thought that’s what you just said, Josh.</p>
<p>No, not quite!</p>
<p>The Ascension does complete the Gospel – as its goal and culmination.</p>
<p>We will all one day be with Christ at the Father’s right hand in glory.</p>
<p>But the story’s not over, because the Ascension also compels the Church.</p>
<p>The Ascension completes the Gospel, and it also compels the Church.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-the-ascension-compel-the-church">HOW DOES THE ASCENSION COMPEL THE CHURCH?</h1>
<p>How does the Ascension compel the Church?</p>
<p>Well, <strong>the Ascension gives the Church</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>its global mission,</strong></li>
<li><strong>its enduring hope,</strong></li>
<li><strong>and its enabling power.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone with me so far?</p>
<p>We’ve talked about the Ascension’s theological significance, how the Ascension completes the Gospel.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the Ascension’s application to our lives – how the Ascension should both challenge us and encourage us.</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-global-mission">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS GLOBAL MISSION</h2>
<p>Here’s the challenge of the Ascension: it gives the Church its global mission.</p>
<p>As Luke told us twice today – in the book of Acts and the Gospel which bears his name – Jesus commissioned his followers as witnesses who were to proclaim the Good News across cultural and ethnic boundaries.</p>
<p>“to all nations” – that word, “nations,” ethnoi, more properly refers to people groups, to cultural and ethnic groups of people, than to modern nation states.</p>
<p>That is, there are plenty of ethnoi represented right here in the United States – including those that haven’t yet heard the gospel!</p>
<p>You remember what I said a minute ago about Jesus not being our buddy?</p>
<p>He’s our King! He’s to be obeyed!</p>
<p>And he wants us to proclaim the gospel to the entire world.</p>
<p>Which, let’s be honest, is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because God’s global gospel runs counter to the nationalistic, tribalistic, and individualistic “gospels” of this earth.</p>
<p>The Good News of God’s global kingdom – won not through self-promotion or military conquest but through self-sacrifice and loving one’s enemies – this gospel runs counter to the false gospels of this world, including the false gospel of the American Dream.</p>
<p>And that cuts right across the grain of the entire political landscape – red state and blue state.</p>
<p>Now to be sure, hear me!, there is a difference between globalism and God’s global gospel.</p>
<p>But there is also a stark difference between the United States of America and the Kingdom of God – between American culture and Kingdom culture.</p>
<p>Let us, then, take heed, lest we American Christians make assimilation to American culture an unofficial prerequisite for the nations of the world.</p>
<p>There is no prerequisite.</p>
<p>There is no response of the world that gives the Church an excuse to abandon its global mission.</p>
<p>In light of the Ascension, the Church’s global mission is to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ across all cultural and ethnic boundaries – obeying its Ascended Lord, who once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” [Matt. 5:43-44].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so this transcultural, enemy-loving gospel stuff sounds great hypothetically, but</p>
<ul>
<li>what about when people blow themselves up to kill children at a concert in Manchester?</li>
<li>What about when people open fire on a bus full of Coptic Christians on their way to pray?</li>
<li>What about when they go on shooting sprees in shopping malls, movie theaters, schools, and churches?</li>
<li>Or what about when people are just so different, so unfamiliar, so awkward, that we just don’t know what to say?</li>
</ul>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>Do we throw up our hands in despair?</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-enduring-hope">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS ENDURING HOPE</h2>
<p>Here’s the encouragement of the Ascension: it gives the Church its enduring hope.</p>
<p>Without the Ascension, we are left wondering whether the good news of Christ’s resurrection will extend to us.</p>
<p>We are left wondering whether the chaos in the world around us will ever cease.</p>
<p>How long, O Lord? How long before you stay the hand of the wicked?</p>
<p>How long before you destroy the earthly powers and dominions and authorities that divide us and destroy us?</p>
<p>Friends, we can still ask these questions today, but it makes all the difference in the world that Christ has ascended.</p>
<p>It makes all the difference in the world that Christ has been enthroned over all earthly powers and dominions and authorities.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the Ascension shows that Christ has triumphed over his enemies.</p>
<p>The way of the Cross has won out over the sinful ways of this world.</p>
<p>And the Ascension also anticipates the second coming of Christ.</p>
<p>Just like Jesus did not stay in the grave, he will not stay at a distance upon his heavenly throne – present in the Church only sacramentally.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>And just like he did not let Sin and Death have the final word, he will not let the servants of Sin and Death have the final word, either.</p>
<p>Instead, he will one day stay the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p>He will one day disarm and destroy those who have decided to persist in rebellion against him.</p>
<p>Christ is enthroned over all earthly powers! This is our enduring hope!</p>
<p>There’s no reason for us to hedge our bets, as it were, by bending the knee to any earthly power – friend or foe.</p>
<p>Instead, the Church can freely exist for the sake of the world, because we know that the world is in the hands of our ascended King.</p>
<h2 id="the-ascension-gives-the-church-its-enabling-power-the-holy-spirit">THE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS ENABLING POWER: THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>So, you know, just get out there and try harder to love people and let them know about Jesus, no matter how different they are!</p>
<p>Right?!</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>We’re not fooling anyone. We can’t do this on our own.</p>
<p>Sure, we’ve got a global mission. And sure, we’ve got an enduring hope.</p>
<p>But we still need enabling power.</p>
<p>And the Ascension gives the Church its enabling power: the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>At the end of Luke’s Gospel, Jesus tells his disciples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high” [Luke 24:53].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, at the beginning of Acts, Jesus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, ‘you heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now” [Acts 1:4-5].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few verses later, Jesus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” [Acts 1:8].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I know I’m getting a bit ahead of myself.</p>
<p>After all, it’s still a week until Pentecost!</p>
<p>But, brothers and sisters, we can’t make it, not even for a week, without the Holy Spirit!</p>
<p>We are only gathered here this morning, some two thousand years since the Ascension, on the other side of the world, because the Holy Spirit has empowered the Church to fulfill its global mission.</p>
<p>And, even though we live in a divided, divisive, and terrifying world, the Holy Spirit can empower the Church today.</p>
<p>So, thanks be to God that the Ascension and Pentecost go hand in hand!</p>
<h3 id="the-ascension-completes-the-gospel-and-compels-the-church-to-fulfill-its-global-mission-clinging-to-its-enduring-hope-empowered-by-the-holy-spirit">THE ASCENSION COMPLETES THE GOSPEL AND COMPELS THE CHURCH TO FULFILL ITS GLOBAL MISSION, CLINGING TO ITS ENDURING HOPE, EMPOWERED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h3>
<p>So, Father, we thank you for your persistence and patience to rescue us from Sin and Death.</p>
<p>Jesus, we bow the knee and worship you, our Ascended Lord. And we ask you to come again soon and make all things new.</p>
<p>And Holy Spirit, we ask you come. Give us the strength to love our neighbors and our enemies by proclaiming and living the gospel.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;There is something special about last meals, isn’t there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to show you a series of photographs. These photographs, except for the last one – which I added, are from &lt;a href=&#34;http://henryhargreaves.com/no-seconds&#34;&gt;a piece called “No Seconds,” and they were put together by Henry Hargreaves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to belabor the artwork with my commentary, so I’ll give you a few seconds to take each slide in.&lt;/p&gt;

The whole idea of a criminal’s last meal affects me deeply. Why?
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The whole idea of a criminal’s last meal affects me deeply. Why?
<p>I think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.</p>
<p>While Jesus of Nazareth was no common criminal, his so-called “Last Supper” with his disciples was a poignant combination of the expected and the unexpected. And when you take a look at the Last Supper, focusing on its unexpected elements, you find out that it’s really a Lasting Supper.</p>
<p>That is, the Last Supper is not just a one-time event, some two-thousand years ago. Instead, Holy Communion, the Lasting Supper, is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.</p>
<h1 id="the-meal"><strong>The Meal</strong></h1>
<p>First, let’s look at the original meal itself, the “Last Supper,” as described in our Gospel lesson (Luke 22:14-20).</p>
<h2 id="passover-an-interpretive-celebration">Passover: An Interpretive Celebration</h2>
<p>Now, as expected, the Passover was an interpretive celebration, because it looked back to the Exodus event – when God rescued his people from slavery in Egypt – in order to explain what salvation looked like.</p>
<p>That is, if you asked any respectable Hebrew what it meant to “be saved,” you would much more likely hear “it’s like when God saved us from Egypt” than “you get to go to heaven after you die.”</p>
<p>Although Passover originated with Exodus 12’s instructions for a hasty meal, eaten while standing a fully dressed, by Jesus’ time the meal had evolved into an elaborate affair.</p>
<p>As best we can tell, in Jesus’ day the meal was structured around four cups of wine. According to New Testament scholar Joel Green, the meal had the following outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>The head of the family would pronounce a blessing over the first cup of wine, which was then shared.</li>
<li>Before the second cup, the youngest son would ask the father questions about what made this night special.</li>
<li>The father would reply by telling the Exodus story, focusing on the summary given in Deut. 26:5-11.</li>
<li>The dinner party would then sing Psalm 113, and then drink the second cup of wine.</li>
<li>The father would then bless, break, and distribute the unleavened bread, followed by the main meal.</li>
<li>Finally, they would consume two more cups of wine, before singing Psalms 114-118.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why am I telling you this?</p>
<p>Because we need to realize that the Passover was no ordinary meal.</p>
<p>Instead, it was an interpretive meal. Words went right along with the food, in order to situate the dinner party in the midst of God’s ongoing Story of Salvation.</p>
<p>Especially given the combination of the Exodus story with the prayers and praises found in Psalms 113-118, the Passover was</p>
<ul>
<li>a remembrance of God’s past deliverance,</li>
<li>a celebration of God’s present faithfulness,</li>
<li>and an anticipation of God’s future deliverance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The past, the present, and the future came together in one meal.</p>
<p>Here’s the framework, or the timeline, if you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original Passover meal (Exod. 12)</li>
<li>The Exodus from Egypt</li>
<li>The establishment of the Covenant</li>
<li>Yearly remembrance of the Passover</li>
<li>In hope of future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>Got that?</p>
<p>Passover, Exodus, Covenant, Remembrance, Hope.</p>
<p>OK, so this is really important: Israel didn’t merely remember the Passover each year to <em><strong>know</strong></em> something but in order to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>change</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>In other words, Passover was supposed to be a transformative remembrance.</p>
<p>Remembering God’s faithfulness was supposed to transform them into God’s faithful followers. Remembering God’s faithfulness was supposed to transform them into God’s faithful covenant partners.</p>
<p>So much for the expected aspects of the Last Supper: it was an interpretive Passover.</p>
<h2 id="an-unexpected-paradigm-shift">An Unexpected Paradigm Shift</h2>
<p>What is unexpected about this meal is how Jesus shifts the paradigm! He takes the whole “Passover, Exodus, Covenant, Remembrance, Hope” timeline and makes himself the center of it!</p>
<p>As the “head of the household,” it’s not strange that Jesus would be the chief speaker during this Passover Meal. However, in vv. 15-16, things start to get weird. Jesus frames the meal as his last meal, prophetically looking forward to his suffering and death.</p>
<p>And yet, perhaps it’s better to say his “second-to-last meal,” because in verses 16 – 18, he predicts that death will not have the final word. Instead, he will partake of the full and final Passover again in the coming kingdom of God!</p>
<p>Remember, we’re expecting Jesus to give an explanation and interpretation of the Exodus story. When Jesus takes the bread and the wine, we expect him to say: “do this in remembrance of the Exodus from Egypt…do this in remembrance of the Covenant.”</p>
<p>Instead, he says: “do this in remembrance of ME!”</p>
<p>This shifts the timeline forward, from Israel’s transformative remembrance of the Passover to the Church’s transformative remembrance of the fulfillment of the Passover, the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>Passover points to the Lord’s Supper, Holy Communion.</p>
<h2 id="new-exodus-new-covenant">New Exodus, New Covenant</h2>
<p>What about the Exodus and the Covenant? Do they point to anything?</p>
<p>They do!</p>
<p>Both the Exodus and the Covenant are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, through the New Exodus and the New Covenant!</p>
<p>In the original Exodus, God saved his people, through Moses, from slavery in Egypt.</p>
<p>In the New Exodus, God saves his people, through Jesus Christ, from slavery to Sin and Death.</p>
<p>In the original Covenant, God gives his people the Law, through Moses, written upon tablets of stone.</p>
<p>In the New Covenant, God gives his people the Law, the Gospel! through Jesus Christ, and writes it upon their hearts.</p>
<p>We see this first in Jesus’ unexpected words about the bread, interpreted as Christ’s battered body.</p>
<p>Look at verse 19. Instead of the expected words about the Passover lamb at this point in the meal, Luke speaks only of Christ’s body, sacrificially “given” for the sake of his disciples.</p>
<p>Then, in verse 20, there are Jesus’ even more shocking words about the cup, which is interpreted as New Covenant blood!</p>
<p>Because the Jews were strictly prohibited from consuming blood (Deut. 12:16, 23-4), there were probably quite a few audible sputters when Christ declared: “this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood” (Luke 22:20)!</p>
<p>Jesus is claiming that, just as the Old Covenant was ratified by blood (see Exod. 24:8), his impending death will ratify the New Covenant of Jeremiah 31:31-34. The sacrifice will be God himself, upon the Cross!</p>
<p>And, according to Jeremiah 31, the New Covenant will bring</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of God,</li>
<li>loyalty to God, and</li>
<li>forgiveness of sins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yahweh says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.</p>
<p>And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord.</p>
<p>For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more” (Jer. 31:33-34).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="passover-and-holy-communion-an-expanded-timeline">Passover and Holy Communion: An Expanded Timeline</h2>
<p>So, to review, the previous timeline was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original Passover</li>
<li>Original Exodus</li>
<li>Establishment of the Covenant</li>
<li>Israel’s Remembrance in Passover meals</li>
<li>Hope for future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the church’s timeline builds upon the previous one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original Last Supper</li>
<li>New Exodus (accomplished at Cross)</li>
<li>New Covenant (accomplished at Cross)</li>
<li>Church’s Remembrance in Holy Communion</li>
<li>Hope for future, final redemption</li>
</ul>
<p>In Holy Communion, we Christians are called to the transformative remembrance of what Christ has accomplished at the Cross.</p>
<p>But we don’t just look back to the Cross. We also look forward to what Jesus will accomplish at the final redemption. You know, when he returns to judge the living and the dead, to right every wrong, and to wipe away every tear!</p>
<p>When we take Holy Communion, we await the heavenly banquet that will fully fulfill both the Passover and the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>Everyone with me so far?</p>
<p>Just as Passover was designed to be a transformative remembrance, to shape the Israelites into faithful followers of God, so too Holy Communion is a transformative remembrance.</p>
<p>It’s meant to transform us into faithful followers of Jesus Christ, faithful members of Christ’s body, the Church!</p>
<h1 id="what-does-transformative-remembrance-look-like">What Does Transformative Remembrance Look Like?</h1>
<p>But, what does that look like?</p>
<p>Sure, I’ve mentioned that the New Covenant is meant to result in</p>
<ul>
<li>knowledge of God,</li>
<li>loyalty to god,</li>
<li>and the forgiveness of sins.</li>
</ul>
<p>But seriously: What does that look like?</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at the rest of our passage, Luke 22:21-30.</p>
<p>Is anyone else confused by how quickly the scene seems to change?</p>
<p>I mean, one moment (v. 20), Jesus is saying the words of institution, and then the very next moment (v. 21-22) Jesus is predicting his betrayal!</p>
<p>In v. 23, the disciples are understandably confused. But then (v. 24) they immediately start bickering about who’s the greatest disciple!</p>
<p>So, Jesus has to remind them (vv. 25-30) that, in his kingdom, true greatness and authority come only through sacrificial service.</p>
<p>What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>I think that these final scenes in our passage offer us a challenging reminder of how the Lord’s Lasting Supper should shape us.</p>
<p>They show us, albeit through the failure of Judas and the disciples, how the remembrance of Holy Communion should transform us into sacrificial servants of Jesus Christ and one another.</p>
<h2 id="servants-or-traitors">Servants? Or Traitors?</h2>
<p>Let me put it to you this way:</p>
<p><strong>When you come to the Lord’s Table, you either come as a servant or a traitor.</strong></p>
<p>You either live a life of serving as you are served by Jesus, or you live a life of grabbing glory and honor and power for yourself.</p>
<p>In our New Testament lesson from 1 Corinthians, the Apostle Paul said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
<p>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup” (1 Cor. 11:27-28).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you can ask yourself many different questions during this process of self-examination, but here’s one for your consideration: do my “table manners” match Jesus’ table manners?</p>
<p>Here are some of the last words of exhortation Jesus gives to his disciples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors.</p>
<p>But not so with you.</p>
<p>Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.</p>
<p>For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves?</p>
<p>Is it not the one who reclines at table?</p>
<p>But I am among you as the one who serves” (Luke 22:25-27).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve got good news, friends: <strong>Jesus is still among us today as the one who serves.</strong></p>
<p>Like always, he gives us his very self, for the sake of our salvation.</p>
<p>Will we follow his example? Will we gratefully accept his service, and – in joyful response to his salvation – serve others in Jesus’ name? Or will we come in betrayal, seeking honor for only ourselves?</p>
<h2 id="foot-washing">Foot Washing</h2>
<p>Now, during our service of Holy Communion, we are going to have a service of Foot-Washing. During that time, I’d like you to remember that the same Lord who washed his disciples’ feet – the dirtiest parts of their bodies – now washes away even the dirtiest parts of our lives with his blood.</p>
<p>And I’d like you to ask yourself: <strong>are you living a life of Christ-like service?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, maybe you don’t wash other people’s feet all the time, but are you willing to sacrificially serve others, as you yourself have been served by Jesus?</p>
<p>The answer, by the way, is NOT “try harder! Be better! Serve more!” No!</p>
<p>INSTEAD, it is to surrender your entire life to Jesus. Only when you’ve accepted his salvation and his lordship will you be able to serve others out of the overflow of Christ’s love in your life.</p>
<h2 id="the-lords-table">The Lord’s Table</h2>
<p>And of course, in addition to the foot-washing, we will come to the Lord’s Table. And, during that time, I’d like you to remember that the same Messiah who so frequently ate with outcasts and sinners now welcomes us outcasts and sinners to come to his table and receive the saving benefits of his broken body and his shed blood.</p>
<p>Friends, <strong>do our table manners match Jesus’ table manners?</strong> Are we reaching out to outcasts and sinners and welcoming them to our tables at home? Are we letting the hurting, the lost, and the broken around us know where they can find food and drink that lead to true, everlasting life?</p>
<p>Remember: <strong>the Lasting Supper is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you come to the Lord’s table, you either come as a traitor or a servant.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks be to God, who invites us all to the table of our Lord Jesus Christ, where he is the gracious host and we are the rebellious traitors who are transformed into faithful servants.</p>
<p><em>Amen</em>.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a problem finding a reliable resource for recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain Google searches are a piece of cake, but the “best resources for ______” ones can be hit-or-miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don’t even get me started on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue&#34;&gt;decision fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. As a serial over-thinker, I start to hate myself a little bit after reading through the upteenth list of “5 Best ____s.” It makes it so hard to make a decision!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever had a problem finding a reliable resource for recommendations?</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>Certain Google searches are a piece of cake, but the “best resources for ______” ones can be hit-or-miss.</p>
<p>And don’t even get me started on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision fatigue</a>. As a serial over-thinker, I start to hate myself a little bit after reading through the upteenth list of “5 Best ____s.” It makes it so hard to make a decision! Then, when you pick something, you end up doubting your decision. Not fun.</p>
<p>I’m sure these dynamics apply to a bunch of different things in life. However, while serving as a Youth Minister in seminary, I realized that finding reliable Christian recommendations and resources can be very difficult.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s not for lack of content out there! When it comes to Christianity, everyone has an opinion – and usually an associated reading list!</p>
<p>But how do you know that the book or blog-post that you find isn’t from some crazy yahoo with nothing more than a computer and a Bible?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you’re a Christian and your looking for recommendations and resources in some <em>other</em> area, how do you know that what you find is worthwhile?</p>
<p>I mean, sure, <em>everything</em> should be read with a critical eye. But is that latest book or blog-post about mindfulness, parenting, self-help, or productivity helpful and useful for Christians? Or will it require quite a bit of theological critique and analysis before it’s helpful without being potentially harmful?</p>
<p>Google is great, and getting better at many things. But – at least for right now – it’s a pretty crappy theologian!</p>
<h1 id="idea-the-well-equipped-christian">Idea: The Well-Equipped Christian</h1>
<p>With all this in mind, I have an idea: <em><strong>The Well-Equipped Christian</strong></em> (or a similar title) – a website that’s a one-stop shop for Christians looking for reliable recommendations and resources.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, I’m not claiming to BE the well-equipped Christian! I am not the be-all-end-all source of reliable Christian information.</p>
<p>However, I am a Christian with a seminary education. I’m pursuing a PhD in theology, and I have a heart for the Church.</p>
<p>I want to devote my life and ministry to helping to produce as many “well-equipped Christians” as possible. And I absolutely <strong>love</strong> giving practical recommendations – specifically in the areas of Bible study, theology, productivity, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning">meta-learning</a>.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great resources out there. Resources that Christians can benefit from to have healthy <strong>minds</strong>, <strong>bodies</strong>, and <strong>souls</strong> as they advance God’s Kingdom in their daily lives.</p>
<p>I want to connect you to those resources.</p>
<h1 id="i-need-your-help">I Need Your Help</h1>
<p>Are you wiling to help me figure out whether or not this is a good idea? If so, great! <strong>I’d love to hear your answers to the following questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the biggest problem that you’ve faced in finding reliable recommendations and resources?</strong> Not just for specifically Christian resources (although that’s great if you want to focus on that), but also for resources in general.</li>
<li><strong>When you talk to your friends about finding reliable recommendations and resources, what kinds of things do you say?</strong> Any specific feelings or complaints?</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, please share this post with anyone you think would be willing to give me their input! Thank you so much!</p>
<p>~Josh</p>

<h2 id="opening-prayer">Opening Prayer</h2>
<p>God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote your <strong>justice</strong></li>
<li>embody your <strong>steadfast faithful love</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>I ask that this transformation would begin with <strong>me</strong>. In Jesus’ name. <em>Amen</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’d like to start off with a very basic question: <strong>Do you want to get ahead in life?</strong></p>
<p>Do you want things to get better? Do you want your life, and your children’s lives, to improve?</p>
<p>I mean, despite the many things that divide us humans, don’t we all want progress? When it comes right down to it, don’t we all just want to get ahead?</p>
<p><em><strong>I know I do.</strong></em></p>
<p>In fact, as the students in our youth group could tell you, this is one of the reasons why I love “life hacks”!</p>
<p>Have you heard of life hacks? They’re these little tips and tricks to get ahead in life while saving time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Like, one of my favorite life hacks is the “coffee nap.” You drink a cup of coffee, then immediately take a 20-minute nap, so that the caffeine kicks in right as you wake up.</p>
<p>Life hack. Try it sometime. Thank me later.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS, we all want to get ahead in life. Right?</p>
<p>But there’s a problem: How do we know what <em>getting ahead</em> looks like?</p>
<p>I mean, think about it. Getting ahead can look quite different in different contexts. Right?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is too crude of an example for a sermon, but getting ahead in a drinking game looks totally different than getting ahead in Alcoholics Anonymous!</p>
<p>Getting ahead in the NBA Finals hopefully looks different than getting ahead in playing basketball with your kids.</p>
<p>Getting ahead on Wall Street as a day-trader hopefully looks different than getting ahead in running a charity.</p>
<p>In order to get ahead,</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to know the <strong>context</strong>,</li>
<li>you have to know the <strong>rules</strong>,</li>
<li>you have to know the <strong>goal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, no matter how hard you try, you’re not really going to get ahead. You’ll just be getting ahead at the wrong thing. Which means you’ll fail.</p>
<p>So here’s the kicker: <strong>Getting ahead in God’s eyes looks a whole lot different than getting ahead in the world’s eyes.</strong></p>
<p>The world is a different context. The world follows different rules. And the world has a different goal than God’s Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-point">The Main Point</h2>
<p>In fact, and here’s my main point if you want to write it down:</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foolish</span> in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<h2 id="gods-upside-down-kingdom--1-corinthians-118-31">God’s Upside-Down Kingdom – 1 Corinthians 1:18-31</h2>
<p>Now, this is the message of all of our readings for today, but I’d like to start with the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:18. (You can find it on page 952 in your pew Bible.)</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 1:18 says:</p>
<p><em><strong>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing</strong></em> (that’s what I’m calling “the world,” by the way – those who are perishing), <em><strong>but to us who are being saved</strong></em> (that is, to us who are a part of God’s Kingdom) <em><strong>it is the power of God.</strong></em></p>
<p>You see, <strong><u>God’s not against getting ahead</u></strong>. In fact, you could even say that God is on a mission to “Make Creation Great Again”!</p>
<p>I’m not kidding! He made it great in the first place – a perfect universe with perfect relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation.</p>
<p>However, ever since we humans rebelled against God – ever since Sin shattered the relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation – God has been on a mission to put everything back together again.</p>
<p>Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>So why is Paul saying that the good news of God’s rescue mission is <em><strong>foolishness</strong></em> to the world?</p>
<p>Because God makes creation great again in a totally unexpected way!</p>
<p><strong>This is what I mean by “<u>God’s upside-down kingdom</u>.”</strong></p>
<p>In order to make the world right again, God shows up and <strong>reverses</strong> the ways the world has gotten used to working. And the greatest reversal of all in God’s upside-down kingdom is when <strong>the eternal Son of God becomes <u>human</u> and gets himself <u>killed</u> for the sins of the entire world.</strong></p>
<p>The world expects</p>
<ul>
<li>power,</li>
<li>might,</li>
<li>strength,</li>
<li>and victory,</li>
</ul>
<p>and we receive instead a</p>
<ul>
<li>naked,</li>
<li>abandoned</li>
<li>Middle-Eastern man,</li>
<li>brutally executed</li>
<li>as a political criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>We receive a <em><strong>bloody example</strong></em> for those who would dare challenge the kingdoms of this world.</p>
<p>We receive a <em><strong>Crucified</strong></em> <em><strong>Savior</strong></em>. And the world calls that absolutely <em><strong><u>RIDICULOUS</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>Because, to the world, you don’t get ahead by <strong>laying your life down</strong> (like Jesus did). You get ahead by <em><u>taking what’s yours</u></em>.</p>
<p>You don’t get ahead by <strong>hanging out with the wrong crowd</strong> (like Jesus did). You’re supposed to <em><u>rub shoulders with the rich and the famous</u></em>, not the <strong>poor</strong> and the <strong>homeless</strong>.</p>
<p>You’re not supposed to <strong>focus on the people at the bottom and at the border</strong> (like Jesus did)!</p>
<p>For crying out loud, you’re supposed to get out there and <em><u>hustle</u></em>!</p>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Climb the ladder! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Make deals! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Take no prisoners! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Make demands! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Get ahead!</u></em></li>
</ul>
<p>…And get right back where we need to be saved <em><strong><u>FROM</u></strong></em>!</p>
<p><em><strong>That’s where the world’s ways get us.</strong></em></p>
<p>Where every human is</p>
<ul>
<li>an egotistical island,</li>
<li>competing with God,</li>
<li>alienating other humans,</li>
<li>and abusing creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, as Paul tells us in <strong>[<u>1 Cor 1:25</u>]</strong>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God saves us through what looks like foolishness and weakness.</p>
<p>Why? So that we would not boast in our pathetic “wisdom” and “strength.”</p>
<p>Instead, we are to boast only in the true wisdom and strength of God.</p>
<p>Paul continues in <strong>[<u>1 Cor. 1:27</u>]</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But God chose what is <u>foolish</u> in the world to shame the <u>wise</u>; God chose what is <u>weak</u> in the world to shame the <u>strong</u>; <sup>28 </sup>God chose what is <u>low</u> and <u>despised</u> in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, <sup>29 </sup>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, then, is the <strong>upside-down Kingdom of God</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="blessed-are-the-losers--matthew-51-12">Blessed are the “Losers” – Matthew 5:1-12</h2>
<p>And it’s the exact same Kingdom that we find in the Beatitudes of Matthew 5.</p>
<p>(FYI: We call them the “Beatitudes” because of the Latin word for “blessed/happy” – <em>beatus</em>.)</p>
<p>Now, remember: <strong>God isn’t against getting ahead. He really does want what’s <u>best</u> for us.</strong></p>
<p>But the danger is that we’ll try to get ahead on our own, in our own way. And if we do that, <strong><u>we’ll miss the point in at least two ways. </u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First, we won’t realize that <strong>we desperately need a Savior</strong>, and that <strong>we cannot save ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>Second, we will <strong>ignore</strong> the very <strong>people</strong> that God wants us to <strong>care for</strong> in order to really get ahead in his Kingdom!</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on our own</span>, we’re going to focus on those at the <strong>center</strong> and <strong>height</strong> of <strong>power</strong>. You know, “The Winners.”</p>
<p>But <u>God focuses</u> on those at the <strong>bottom</strong> and at the <strong>borders</strong>, the <strong>edges</strong> of society. You know, “The Losers.”</p>
<p><em>These</em> are the people who will experience God’s favor in his Upside-Down Kingdom. Take a look at [<strong><u>Matthew 5:3-12</u></strong>].</p>
<p>Notice how Jesus declares God’s favor, His blessing, to what the world would call the “wrong kind of people.”</p>
<ul>
<li>To the <strong>poor</strong> in spirit</li>
<li>Those who <strong>mourn</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>meek</strong></li>
<li>Those who <strong>hunger</strong> and thirst for righteousness</li>
<li>The <strong>merciful</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>pure</strong> in heart</li>
<li>The <strong>peacemakers</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>persecuted</strong></li>
<li>And the <strong>reviled</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And notice as well, that the blessings frequently involve <strong>reversals</strong>. The world is giving them one thing, but God is going to give them another.</p>
<p>Now, this is important: these famous words are a <strong><u>mixture</u></strong> of <strong>encouragement</strong> and <strong>instruction</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, Jesus isn’t just giving us a TO-DO LIST in order to get as much blessing as possible. He’s not saying “Go out there and try harder to be poor, persecuted, hungry, mourners.”</p>
<p>Now, Jesus IS <strong>instructing</strong>, more on that in a second. <strong>But</strong> he is first offering divine <strong>encouragement</strong> to those who are <em><strong><u>already</u></strong></em> in those situations.</p>
<h2 id="the-beatitudes-an-interpretive-translation">The Beatitudes: An Interpretive Translation</h2>
<p>Here’s my interpretive translation of the Beatitudes. Follow along with each one if you’ve got a Bible in front of you.</p>
<p>Jesus is saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) “Take heart! Things aren’t what they seem! If you <strong>lack resources</strong> and realize that God alone can save you, then you might not feel like a part of the Roman kingdom. But <strong>you’re a part of God’s Kingdom</strong>.”</li>
<li>(2) “Be encouraged! If you <strong>bear</strong> and <strong>grieve</strong> the <strong>sufferings</strong> of the world, then the kings of the world probably won’t give you much <strong>comfort</strong>. <strong>But God, your true King, will.</strong></li>
<li>(3) Take heart! If you <strong>humbly</strong> and <strong>gently</strong> <strong>refuse</strong> to seek <strong>vengeance</strong> or <strong>power</strong>, then you probably won’t inherit much from the world’s kingdoms. <strong>But God will give you an inheritance in His Kingdom</strong>.</li>
<li>(4) Be encouraged! If you <strong>pursue God’s will above all else</strong>, then you’ll probably go <strong>hungry</strong> in this world. But you will be <strong>satisfied</strong> in God’s Kingdom, where His <strong>will</strong> is <strong>obeyed</strong>.</li>
<li>(5) Take heart! If you show <strong>mercy</strong> and <strong>compassion</strong> to a suffering world, you might not receive much mercy back! <strong>But you yourselves will be shown mercy by God.</strong></li>
<li>(6) Be encouraged! If you <strong>single-mindedly</strong> pursue God’s will, then you probably won’t experience the world’s glory. <strong>But</strong> <strong>you will experience God’s glory and presence.</strong></li>
<li>(7) Take heart! If you <strong>pursue</strong> <strong>reconciliation</strong> and <strong>reject violence</strong>, then you probably won’t reflect the character of this world. <strong>But you will reflect the character of God.</strong></li>
<li>(8) Take heart! Because when this world <strong>rejects</strong> you, <strong>insults</strong> you, <strong>lies</strong> about you, and <strong>persecutes</strong> you, then it may not look like it, <strong>but you’re in good company! You’re in the company of your Savior, Jesus Christ.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Friends, if you’re here today and you’re at the bottom of this world, then I <strong>encourage</strong> you to <strong>cling</strong> to the divine <strong>promises</strong> of <strong>blessing</strong> in the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>God is in the process of making all things new – <strong>reversing</strong> every wrong in this world. <em><strong><u>Take heart.</u></strong></em></p>
<p>However, and perhaps this is uncomfortable to talk about, <strong>what if we’re NOT on this list?</strong></p>
<p>What if we’re NOT</p>
<ul>
<li>poor,</li>
<li>mourning,</li>
<li>meek,</li>
<li>hungry,</li>
<li>merciful,</li>
<li>pure-hearted,</li>
<li>peacemakers</li>
<li>who are persecuted?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if we’re</p>
<ul>
<li>reasonably well-educated</li>
<li>and wealthy,</li>
<li>comfortable,</li>
<li>powerful</li>
<li>American</li>
<li>Christians?</li>
</ul>
<p>How should we respond to the Beatitudes?</p>
<p>While I <strong>DON’T</strong> think that the Beatitudes should be read like a <strong>TO-DO list</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>I DO think that the Beatitudes are an <u>instructive</u> <u>challenge</u> to followers of Jesus.</strong></p>
<p>There is a reason why the Beatitudes are at the beginning of Jesus’ quintessential sermon.</p>
<p>It’s almost like Jesus is saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“OK, you want to follow me?</p>
<p>You want to be a part of my coming Kingdom? Then let’s get really clear on <strong>what this Kingdom is going to be like</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be the kind of Kingdom you’re used to in this world.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of kingdom where the <strong>wealthy</strong>, <strong>wise</strong>, and <strong>powerful</strong> get <u>rewarded</u>.</p>
<p>Instead, in MY Kingdom, <strong>the people who get <u>chewed up</u> and <u>spit out</u> by the kingdoms of this world will be <u>rewarded</u> and <u>honored</u>.</strong></p>
<p>SO,</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want to be a part of my Kingdom,</li>
<li>if you want to “get ahead” in my Kingdom,</li>
<li>then <strong>you better show concrete concern for</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>the oppressed,</strong></li>
<li><strong>the marginalized,</strong></li>
<li><strong>and the weak!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as you do so, you’d better be prepared to end up among the oppressed and the marginalized, because the world is going to think you are out of your minds!”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fear-is-not-a-valid-excuse">Fear is NOT a Valid Excuse</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, remember:</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But there is no escape clause from the rules of God’s Kingdom!</strong></p>
<p>That is, you can’t just ignore Jesus and the Bible because you’re SCARED.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>how a congregation is going to respond to your sermon,</strong></li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>looking foolish</strong>,</li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>losing your job</strong>,</li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>a terrorist attack</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not that Jesus doesn’t care about your fears. He does.</p>
<p><em><strong>But let’s not kid ourselves!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>FEAR</strong> is not a valid excuse for ignoring the Bible’s repeated commands for God’s people to show faithful concern for the kinds of people the world ignores and mistreats!</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="application-consistently-pro-life-for-the-unborn-and-the-refugees">Application: Consistently Pro-Life, for the Unborn AND the Refugees</h2>
<p>So, let’s get practical here. How should we respond to these passages about God’s Upside-Down Kingdom?</p>
<p>We must show concrete concern for the powerless. And two recent issues come to mind, that I would be a coward not to mention.</p>
<h3 id="abortion">Abortion</h3>
<p><strong><u>First</u></strong>, in light of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Life_(Washington,_D.C.)">44th March for Life</a> held this past weekend, <strong>I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that we must continue to stand up for the unborn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abortion</strong> is a gruesome <strong>evil</strong>. And like other forms of evil, it is complex – not easily eradicated.</p>
<p>As Christians, we must wage war against this evil. And that will involve caring not only for the <strong>unborn child</strong>, but also the <strong>mother</strong>, and the child <strong>after</strong> it is born, and the entire <strong>family</strong>.</p>
<p>Repealing Roe v. Wade isn’t going to completely solve the problem.</p>
<p>Christians will have to step up to the plate and be <strong>consistently pro-life</strong> in order to fix things.</p>
<p>If you’re passionate about this issue, I encourage you to check out the organization <a href="http://anglicansforlife.org/"><strong>Anglicans for Life</strong></a> at <strong><a href="http://anglicansforlife.org/">AnglicansForLife.Org</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>So, first, we must stand up for the unborn.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="refugees">Refugees</h3>
<p><strong><u>Second</u></strong>, given <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/01/trump-immigration-order-muslims/514844/">President Trump’s recent executive actions</a> to halt the acceptance of all refugees to the USA, including a temporary moratorium on seven predominantly Muslim countries,</p>
<p><strong>I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that, if we are to be consistently pro-life, we must also stand up for the <u>refugees</u>.</strong></p>
<p>Next to the unborn, refugees around the world – but especially from Syria – are among the most <strong>vulnerable</strong> and <strong>powerless</strong> people in the world.</p>
<p>Christians should be standing up for and supporting these people. And, to their credit, many Christians are doing so.</p>
<p>I’d encourage you to check out the great work being done by organizations like <a href="https://www.worldrelief.org/"><strong>World Relief</strong></a> and <a href="https://wewelcomerefugees.com/"><strong>We Welcome Refugees</strong></a>. Talk to me after the service if you’d like more ideas and reading recommendations, by the way.</p>
<p>However, many Christians in this country are <strong>falling prey to the fear excuse</strong>.</p>
<p>We’re being tempted to turn away these vulnerable people because of the <strong>supposed risk of a terrorist attack</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong>I’m here this morning to plead with you: Do not fall prey to this nonsense.</strong> </u></strong></p>
<p>Even if the fear were <em><strong>legitimate</strong></em>, it is no <strong>excuse</strong> for Christians not to show concrete love to the powerless.</p>
<p>Whoever said that following Jesus would not involve any risks?</p>
<p>We dare not worship the <em><strong>American gods</strong></em> of <strong>comfort</strong> and <strong>security</strong> while neglecting to follow the True God’s commands.</p>
<p>However, <strong>these fears of refugees are VASTLY overblown.</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf">a September 2016 <strong>Policy Analysis</strong> from the <strong>CATO</strong> institute</a>,</p>
<ul>
<li>“the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a <strong>refugee</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>1 in 3.64 billion per year.”</strong></li>
<li>The chance of being murdered in a terrorist attack committed by an <strong>asylum-seeker is 1 in 2.73 billion per year.</strong></li>
<li>And “the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an <strong>illegal</strong> <strong>immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison: <a href="http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx">according to the National Safety Council</a>, <strong>your chance of dying from a lightning strike is 1 in 174,426</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong><u><strong>That means it’s about 20,868 times more likely that you will get killed by lightning than by a refugee terrorist attack.</strong></u></strong></em></p>
<p>While we’re worried about astronomical odds, these people are dying. The death toll from the Syrian conflict is approaching half a million, including 50 thousand children.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, please don’t mishear me. I’m not saying that the USA shouldn’t change anything about its policies. Surely there are many problems which need fixed.</p>
<p>However, I beg you: please do not fall prey to the fear-mongering. Please think and reason as <strong>Christians</strong> first.</p>
<p>After all, you can only give your “total allegiance” to one thing.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ will not settle for second place to the United States.</strong></p>
<p>So, stand up for the unborn and the refugees, not to mention the countless other marginalized, oppressed, and powerless people around us.</p>
<p>And I don’t even have time to get into how Christians should be concerned for religious liberties for all faiths. That’s a whole other sermon…</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But, if our Gospel is true, then we of all people should be willing to put our lives and our reputations at risk for the sake of others – especially for the poor and the needy.</strong></p>
<h2 id="closing-prayer">Closing Prayer</h2>
<p>So, again, God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would transform us from the inside out</p>
<ul>
<li>So that we would promote your <strong>justice</strong></li>
<li>So that we would embody your <strong>steadfast faithful love</strong></li>
<li>and so that we would <strong>humbly</strong> obey Your will,</li>
<li>even if it costs us our <em>reputations</em>,</li>
<li>and even if it costs us our <em>lives</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ask that this transformation would begin with me, and that it would extend to the ends of the earth. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Christian theologians Karl Barth (1886-1968) and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) inherited a particular understanding of religion. In the broadly post-Kantian milieu, nineteenth-century thinkers such as Friedrich Schleiermacher, Albrecht Ritschl, and Adolf von Harnack defined religion essentially, anthropologically, and subjectively. That is, religion has a particular essence, and is in some manner inalienable from our humanity. The emphasis of this conception is on the experience of the religious subject, instead of the knowledge of religion’s object (let alone its reality).&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; It is this notion of religion that both Barth and Bonhoeffer challenged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Christian theologians Karl Barth (1886-1968) and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) inherited a particular understanding of religion. In the broadly post-Kantian milieu, nineteenth-century thinkers such as Friedrich Schleiermacher, Albrecht Ritschl, and Adolf von Harnack defined religion essentially, anthropologically, and subjectively. That is, religion has a particular essence, and is in some manner inalienable from our humanity. The emphasis of this conception is on the experience of the religious subject, instead of the knowledge of religion’s object (let alone its reality).<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> It is this notion of religion that both Barth and Bonhoeffer challenged.</p>
<p>(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/">Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?</a>“)</p>
<p>However, despite the challenge they issued to their shared intellectual heritage, Barth and Bonhoeffer appear to diverge on both the definition and, therefore, the critique of religion – at least during the stage of Bonhoeffer’s 1943-45 imprisonment. While Barth unleashed a thoroughgoing theological critique of religion as faithlessness [<em>Unglaube</em>], he also insisted that humans were always and unavoidably religious.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Barth maintained that, despite the liabilities of religion, we cannot and should not be religion<em>less</em> because we are not truly godless.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> Bonhoeffer, however, spoke in 1944-45 of a desirably “religionless Christianity.”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> This, despite the fact that he ostensibly intended to carry forward Barth’s theological critique of religion – which was, in Bonhoeffer’s opinion, Barth’s “greatest merit” as a theologian.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Whether Barth and Bonhoeffer share a common theological critique of religion has been subject to intense scholarly debate. To answer this question, we need first to ask another: What did Barth and Bonhoeffer mean by the term “religion”? <strong>I propose that, although Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s <em>definitions</em> of religion diverge, their <em>critiques</em> of religion converge. Barth developed a systematic/dialectical concept of religion as self-justification, which the early Bonhoeffer inherited. However, in prison, Bonhoeffer developed a historical/psychological definition of religion as an inward and partial approach to human life.</strong> We must realize that these are two different definitions of religion, lest we compare apples to oranges, as it were, and conclude that Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s critiques of religion also diverged.</p>
<p><strong>Once we realize the divergent definitions, we can see the convergent critiques of a particular essence of religion: the self-justifying projection of a deity – a projection which calls for theological analysis. That is, for both Barth and Bonhoeffer, at the heart of “religion” is the impulse to posit and make room for a “God,” in order to secure our own identities by means of and over against this deity. Although religion, thus understood, is inescapable, it is not constitutive of our humanity.</strong></p>

      <title>A Disappointing Christmas Homily</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/a-christmas-homily/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! And Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, let us pray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good morning! And Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>Together, let us pray:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. <strong><em>Amen</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Almighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. <em><strong>Amen.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know, they say that Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. I’ve even heard it said that it’s the “hap-happiest season of all”!</p>
<p>But, can I take a poll real quick?</p>
<p>Please raise your hand if you’ve ever had a disappointing Christmas.</p>
<p>I mean a Christmas that didn’t live up to your expectations. You wanted it to be filled with love, happiness, and peace, and instead all you got was stress, anxiety, and loneliness.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-ever-had-a-disappointing-christmas">Have you ever had a disappointing Christmas?</h3>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>Now, why am I being such a downer? Isn’t this supposed to be a joyful occasion?</p>
<p>I mean, joy, triumph, and exultation practically drip out of every song we’ve sung and every passage we’ve read this morning! Why talk about the disappointments of Christmas?</p>
<p>Well, because we too often try to combat the disappointments of Christmas with shallow denial or escapism.</p>
<p>When things go wrong at Christmas,</p>
<ul>
<li>we tell the kids to shut up and turn the Christmas music up a little louder.</li>
<li>We throw money at our problems.</li>
<li>We withdraw into our shells,</li>
<li>and delude ourselves into thinking that next year will be different.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe, we’ve encountered so many disappointments, heartbreaks, and disasters in this world that we’ve given up hope completely.</p>
<p>We come to Church – perhaps just once a year, around Christmas – for the sake of relatives or nostalgia. But the story of Christ’s birth rings just as hollow as any other Christmas story.</p>
<p>I mean, can we really sing “Joy to the World” in Aleppo, Syria?</p>
<p>In South Sudan?</p>
<p>In Berlin?</p>
<p>In the intensive care unit?</p>
<p>In our own troubled homes?</p>
<p><strong>Yes, we can. In fact, we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span>.</strong></p>
<h3 id="we-must-sing-joy-to-the-world--even-through-tears--in-the-deepest-and-darkest-disappointments-of-this-world">We must sing Joy to the World – even through tears – in the deepest and darkest disappointments of this world.</h3>
<p>No matter how painful things get, we cannot celebrate Christmas by ignoring, denying, and detaching from the world around us.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because, although we live in a deeply disappointing world, we do not worship a disappointing God.</p>
<p>Although we frequently feel distant and detached from God and from one another, he is not distant or detached from us!</p>
<p>Instead, he has dwelt among us – as one of us! – in order to bring us back into perfect relationship with Him, with each other, and with all of creation.</p>
<p>Although we rebel against God, and run in the opposite direction – away from light and life into darkness and death – he does not abandon us. He does not keep us at arm’s length.</p>
<p>No, instead He dives from heaven’s heights into the muck and the mire of our sin- and death-stained world. He joins us in the thick of things, in order to bring us back to God.</p>
<h3 id="consider-the-disappointing-circumstances-of-his-birth">Consider the disappointing circumstances of his birth!</h3>
<p>We have thoroughly romanticized the nativity scene. Sure, there were glimpses of the extraordinary – such as the appearance of angels and the fact that Jesus was born to a virgin.</p>
<p>But when you consider that this is the arrival of the eternal and divine Son of God to the world he created, Christ’s birth is remarkably ordinary and humble – you may even call it disappointing, if you didn’t know any better.</p>
<p>It happened in a feeding trough, surrounded by animals and poor shepherds. He was born to poor parents, not yet fully wed! And this all took place in a tiny, po-dunk sheep town!</p>
<p><strong><em>This</em>?! <em>This</em> is Christ the King? Whom shepherds guard and angels sing?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This</em> is the eternal Son of God?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this baby in a feeding trough?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> is the heir of all things? The creator of heaven and earth?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this homeless itinerant preacher with a penchant for lepers, prostitutes, and tax-collectors?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact of imprint of his nature?</strong></p>
<p>You mean, this criminal hanging on a bloodstained Roman cross?</p>
<p><strong><em>He</em> upholds the universe by the word of his power?</strong></p>
<h3 id="are-you-sure">Are you sure?!</h3>
<p>Because at his birth, throughout his life, and at his death, he is surrounded by the <strong>outcasts</strong> of this world! By the broken bits that the universe churns out!</p>
<p><strong>Are you sure this is God? Are you sure this is how he saves the world?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yes</strong></span>. Although, I do understand that this is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shocking</span>.</p>
<h3 id="christmas-is-shocking">Christmas is shocking.</h3>
<p>It’s either a shocking disappointment or a shocking hope.</p>
<p>As we read in Hebrews, <em><strong>in these last days, God has spoken to us through his Son, Jesus Christ.</strong></em></p>
<p>But what he has spoken can, at least for now, be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rejected</span> and ignored.</p>
<p>Consider again the words of John 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-would-we-reject-jesus">Why would we reject Jesus?</h3>
<p>Perhaps we’re not interested in such humble Savior. We’re interested in power, and we’re interested in staying in control.</p>
<p>We think that, despite life’s disappointments, we can fix this on our own. We can give our own lives some sense of meaning and purpose. We think we can save ourselves…</p>
<p>But <strong>we can’t save ourselves from Sin and Death</strong>. And it’s about time we admit that.</p>
<h3 id="thankfully-however-that-baby-born-in-bethlehem-can-save-us-all">Thankfully, however, that baby born in Bethlehem can save us all</h3>
<p>– even those at the <strong>bottom</strong> of this world – because he himself went to the bottom, to the outcasts, to the borders, and to the grave.</p>
<p>But he didn’t stay there!</p>
<p>He rose again victorious over the grave.</p>
<p>His death put Death itself to death.</p>
<p>And, as Hebrews 1 says, <strong>“After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.”</strong></p>
<p>And from there we await his <strong>return</strong>.</p>
<p>The Word who became flesh and made his dwelling among us will dwell with us once more, as Revelation 21 tells us.</p>
<p>He will wipe away every tear from our eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-be-a-part-of-this-hope">How can we be a part of this hope?</h3>
<p>Not by rejecting Jesus, but by receiving him. As John 1 continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have not yet <strong>received</strong> Jesus, entrusting your life to him as your Lord and Savior, then I beg you to <strong>do so</strong> this morning.</p>
<p>As we’ll sing in a bit, this is the meaning of Christmas! Christ was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>born that we no more may die, born to raise us from the earth, born to give us second birth!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now! He stands ready and willing to save you, to forgive you, and to welcome you into eternal life – if you will turn to him in <strong>repentance</strong> and <strong>faith</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s the response some of you are called to make this Christmas.</p>
<p>What about the rest of us?</p>
<h3 id="we-are-all-of-us-called-to-worship-the-god-who-has-dwelt-among-us-in-order-to-save-us">We are, all of us, called to worship the God who has dwelt among us in order to save us.</h3>
<p>We are, all of us, called to sing to the Lord a fresh, new song, for he has done marvelous things!</p>
<p>In the midst of the sorrows and disappointments of this world, with which our God is well-acquainted, we are, all of us, called to make a joyful noise to the Lord, to break forth into joyous songs and sing praises!</p>
<p>Amen?</p>

      <title>Christians and Wealth: An Argument for Downward Mobility</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Great news! If you only have a minute to read about wealth, here’s my argument in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;outline-of-my-argument&#34;&gt;Outline of My Argument&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Claim: American Christians should reduce their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor and oppressed.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is the firmest advocate for human flourishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pursuit of wealth is spiritually dangerous and crippling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our culture’s inclinations toward upward financial mobility go against the message of the New Testament and the life of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God is revealed in Scripture to have a special concern for the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians will be held accountable for how they treat the poor and the oppressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objections:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This line of reasoning is advocating asceticism and is unbiblical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians have every right to keep what they have earned and to do what they wish with their excess funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the poor are lazy, Christians should not feel pressured to give, in case their generosity is taken advantage of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warrant:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christians want to remain true to Scripture and submit to God’s way of life in order to find satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<p>Still interested in reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_poverty_and_wealth">this contentious topic</a>? Continue below.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In our current context of wealth and poverty existing side by side in a milieu of materialistic consumerism, the Christian gospel of denying ourselves and making much of God is being abandoned for the American gospel of denying others and making much of ourselves.</p>
<p>American Christians have become content to live a baptized version of the American dream, a hollow faith that is about maximizing your earthly portfolio once your salvation is secured.</p>
<p>My main contention is that <strong>Christians in the United States should lower their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor</strong>. In doing so, they will remain faithful to Scripture and discover a more satisfactory way of life.</p>
<h2 id="isnt-that-asceticism">Isn’t That Asceticism?</h2>
<p>At this point, some may claim that I am trying to advocate for a form of asceticism.</p>
<p>While my claim might appear that way when viewed through our culture’s thick lens of materialistic consumerism, I believe that I am actually advocating for a more satisfactory way of life.</p>
<p>God is revealed in Scripture to be the firmest advocate for human flourishing. That is, he desires what is truly best for his creation and his people. He created everything to be structurally good and is currently in the process of redeeming the universe from its directional digression away from its intended God-exalting purposes.</p>
<p>Things like hunger and poverty are on the chopping block in this redemptive mission. The standard to which everything is being drawn is not an eternally unsatisfying state of Spartan living and ascetic suffering. It is the eternally satisfying and rich state of glorifying God like creation was intended to.</p>
<p>I am advocating for a <em><strong>return</strong></em> to standards of living necessary for human flourishing, realizing that this standard will vary greatly from person to person and culture to culture.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> The problem is that <strong>what appears to be the standard of human flourishing to us is often quite damaging</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="false-wealth-the-dangers-of-materialism">False Wealth: The Dangers of Materialism</h2>
<p>The Bible pulls no punches in describing the dangers of a materialistic pursuit of wealth.</p>
<p>While money is nowhere declared to be intrinsically evil, Scripture makes it clear that we are all sin-stained creatures prone to greed and self-justification, and that an abundance of wealth and possessions makes it very hard to rise above our idolatrous inclinations and serve God well.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In addition, although it exceeds the scope of this essay, a strong argument can be made that our society’s pragmatic commitment to “getting ahead” is destroying our ability to experience genuine delight in the small things in life which do not increase our bottom line.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Despite our initial reactions, it appears as though what our culture is encouraging us to pursue is actually quite destructive to our ability to serve God well and genuinely enjoy life.</p>
<h2 id="downward-mobility">Downward Mobility</h2>
<p>While the culture around us is calling us towards a lifestyle of upward financial mobility, “the emphasis of the New Testament lies not on the acquisition side of things…but on sacrifice and divestiture”.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The incarnation of Jesus is a clear example of the kind of God we serve, one who emptied himself of the riches of heaven in order to take on human flesh and demonstrate a fiercely sacrificial obedience that took him all the way to the cross. Although there is a big gap between <em>kenosis</em> and a Christian’s obligation to give to the poor, it nonetheless serves as an example of the kind of living we are called to by the gospel.</p>
<p>At the very least, it is reasonable to say that the life of Jesus the Messiah was an atrocious failure when judged by our society’s standards of materialistic consumerism, and yet as Christians, we would all (presumably) confess that we are called to follow his example.</p>
<p>Again, keep in mind that we are not all called to live ascetically and to spurn the legitimate pleasures of this life. However, one would be hard pressed to find biblical support for our culture’s view of wealth and success.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-my-rights">What About My Rights?</h2>
<p>At this point, we are all tempted to rebuff and claim that we have every right to keep all of what we have “earned” and do as we wish with our excess funds.</p>
<p>However, the Bible presents us with the uncomfortable truth that <strong>everything we “own” is in fact owned by God and has been given to us to steward well</strong>.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>A prosperous Christian is not an intrinsic oxymoron, and there are examples in Scripture of wealthy people who seem to have genuinely loved God and served him well. However, there is no example of a person who selfishly viewed their possessions as their own, lived a lifestyle of extravagant wealth, and honored God by doing so.</p>
<p>Even more uncomfortable is the fact that, if God expects us to follow his example in our stewardship of his resources, then we are faced with a strong biblical mandate to give generously to the poor and fight for their justice.</p>
<h2 id="arent-the-poor-just-lazy">Aren’t the Poor Just Lazy?</h2>
<p>In my own experience, our culture’s stereotype of the poor consigns their condition to <em><strong>laziness</strong></em>. Evangelical Christians seem to use this stereotype to effectively avoid giving generously to the poor under the pretense of good stewardship and not wanting their giving to be taken advantage of by lazy individuals.</p>
<p>With regards to being taken advantage of, <strong>Christians should perhaps be the most willing people to be taken advantage of in their giving</strong>. After all, we frequently take advantage of God’s grace in our own lives, and if he modeled the same attitude to us that we display to the poor, we would be in a sorry state of affairs.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>However, <strong>the biblical picture of the poor emphasizes their destitution, need, lack of resources, and suffering under oppression.</strong><a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In contrast to our frequently apathetic response, God seems to have a bias to the poor. Karl Barth claimed that “<em><strong>God always takes his stand unconditionally and passionately on this side and this side alone: against the lofty and on behalf of the lowly; against those who enjoy right and privilege and on behalf of those who are denied it and deprived of it</strong></em>”.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Consider the biblical account.</p>
<ul>
<li>God intervened to save his people from the oppression and poverty they suffered in at the hands of the Egyptians.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn9">[9]</a></li>
<li>He made his frustration at his people’s improper treatment of the impoverished known through the prophets.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn10">[10]</a></li>
<li>Jesus the Messiah cited his own mission as one that was inextricably tied to the poor and oppressed.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn11">[11]</a></li>
<li>The final judgment will be executed (at least partially so) with regards to the treatment (or mistreatment) of the poor.<a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steele/My%20Documents/Downloads/WEALTH%20ESSAY.docx#_ftn12">[12]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture makes it abundantly clear that <strong>God’s heart is for the impoverished, destitute, and oppressed</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As Christians, we must take seriously the words of our Savior that how we treat “the least of these” has serious import on how we treat and serve Christ himself.</p>
<p>We must take the whole witness of Scripture into account and realize that the God we serve and whose resources we steward shows special concern for the poor and oppressed.</p>
<p>We must be willing to acknowledge that our culture’s values of materialistic consumerism run against the grain of the gospel of “sacrifice and divestiture,” opening our eyes to the spiritual dangers of pursuing wealth and possessions.</p>
<p>Above all, perhaps, we must be willing to eschew the idolatry in our hearts and trust that our Heavenly Father knows what is best for us and desires to see us truly flourish in our sacrifice and generosity.</p>
<p>Then, and only then, will we be able to reduce our extravagant standards of living, give to the poor from our excess resources out of genuine generosity, and flourish as human beings by fulfilling our primary purpose: exalting and making much of our Maker.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(A chapel message in a Christian school.)</em></p>
<p>There are a few things you should know about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a student at a <em>Christian</em> seminary.</li>
<li>Before that, I went to a <em>Christian</em> college.</li>
<li>Before that, I went to a <em>Christian</em> high school, and a <em>Christian</em> middle school.</li>
<li>Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a <em>Christian</em> home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, also: I’m <strong>the world’s worst sports fan</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every week, they’re like, “Josh, did you see the game?!” “Josh, are you going to watch the game?”</p>
<p>And I’m like, “Game? What game? I don’t even know which sport’s season it is!”</p>
<p>World’s. worst. sports fan. I’m telling you.</p>
<p>The one redeeming quality about my sports fandom is that I’ve stuck with one team through thick and thin: the University of Michigan Wolverines. Go Blue!</p>
<p>Now, I know that the rivalry between the Wolverines and the Ohio State Buckeyes is but a pale imitation of the rivalry between Alabama and Auburn down here. But up North, this rivalry was and is a big deal.</p>
<p>And it was really interesting, back when I was in middle school and high school, to observe what would happen each year in November when the Wolverines and the Buckeyes went at it.</p>
<p>I’m from Toledo, OH, which is on the border with Michigan, so the fan split was about 50/50 – Wolverines on one side, Buckeyes on the other.</p>
<p>And each year, on the day after the big game, you could tell who the true fans were…</p>
<p>It was the people still cheering for the team that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>lost</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>Why not the winning fans? Weren’t they just as legit?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. Perhaps they were legitimate, lifelong fans. But, on the other hand, they could just be cheering for the winning team because they won, right?</p>
<p>They could, in other words, just be <strong>bandwagon</strong> fans.</p>
<h2 id="bandwagon-fans-are-the-worst-right">Bandwagon fans are the worst. <em>Right</em>?</h2>
<p>I mean, you can’t trust them. Sure, they look like a die-hard fan now, when the team is doing well. But, when things get rough, when those wins stop coming, they disappear! On to the next team, at least as long as they keep on winning…</p>
<p>Bandwagon fans. <em>Those people</em> are the worst.</p>
<p>But, you know, if we’re honest with ourselves, <em><strong>we</strong></em> tend to ride a lot of bandwagons in life, and not just in sports.</p>
<p>We ride the bandwagon when it comes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>How we speak</li>
<li>What we wear</li>
<li>What we read</li>
<li>What we listen to</li>
<li>What we watch</li>
<li>What we eat and drink</li>
</ul>
<p>We ride bandwagons when it comes to our friends. Our hobbies.</p>
<p>And, if we’re really honest with ourselves, our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faith</span>.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-bandwagon-christians">We are Bandwagon Christians</h2>
<p>Hear me out. Hear me out. I’m not saying that there are no genuine followers of Jesus Christ here.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that, to some extent, being a Christian is built into the very fabric of our lives. I am, after all, speaking here at a Christian school, which meets in a church!</p>
<p>And me? I’m no better. I’m a student at a Christian school, and always have been! I’ve been around Christians my entire life!</p>
<p>Now, is being around Christians a bad thing? Should we all stop going to church?</p>
<p>No! That’s not what I’m saying.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that, if we’re not careful, following Jesus Christ will be just another thing we do to go with the flow, to follow the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Following Jesus will become just a matter of convenience, instead of devotion.</strong></p>
<p>And, just like any bandwagon fan, the danger for us bandwagon Christians is that, when things get tough, we’ll be exposed for who we really are – followers of ourselves, instead of followers of Jesus.</p>
<p>Friends, we’re all, to some extent, bandwagon Christians.</p>
<p>And here’s the bad news:</p>
<h2 id="jesus-doesnt-want-bandwagon-followers">Jesus Doesn’t Want Bandwagon Follower<strong>s!</strong></h2>
<p>Turn with me, if you’ve got your Bible, to Luke, chapter 14. Verse 25.</p>
<p>Now, for a bit of context, Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem. You know, where he’s about to be tortured and killed. And he’s got this big ol’ crowd of people with him.</p>
<p>I want you to imagine that we – all of us – are in that group of people, following Jesus.</p>
<p>And Jesus is about to drop a truth-bomb on all of us, that he is not interested in bandwagon followers. He doesn’t want them.</p>
<p>What does he want? Let’s read to find out. Verse 25 begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>25 </sup>Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them,<sup>26 </sup>“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="jesus-doesnt-want-bandwagon-followers-instead-he-wants-your-ultimate-loyalty">Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers. Instead, he wants your ultimate loyalty.</h3>
<p>See, he’s not urging us to get really angry at our family. And he’s not telling you to hate yourself or beat yourself up.</p>
<p>No, instead the word “hate” here emphasizes a <em>decision</em> to be made: <strong>who are you going to be loyal to, above all else?</strong></p>
<p>In that culture, your family was your source of identity. You were supposed to be loyal to them, no matter what.</p>
<p>Is Jesus saying that families are bad? No. Not at all.</p>
<p>But he is saying that, for his followers, he needs to be even more important to them than whatever else they give their loyalty to.</p>
<p>So, what is that for you and I, today? Is it your family? Or is it your friends? Is it your popularity, or the way you look? Is it your athletic or musical ability?</p>
<p><strong>Where do you find your identity? What gets your ultimate loyalty?</strong></p>
<p>Is it Jesus? Or is it ______?</p>
<p>Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers; he wants your <strong>ultimate loyalty</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="he-also-wants-your-life">He also wants your life.</h3>
<p>Let’s read verse 27:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>27 </sup>Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus is saying that his followers are to live as if they’re condemned to die. Pick up your electric chair and follow Jesus!</p>
<p>Yes, it sounds gruesome. But think about it. If you were really condemned to be executed soon, how would you live differently?</p>
<p>You see, death has a weird way of revealing what’s really important to us. If you knew you were going to die soon, would you spend your time chasing after status, money, or fame?</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>Jesus wants us to live differently than the world around us. He wants us to live in a way that screams to the world “There is more to life than being powerful! There is more to life than being popular! There is more to life than being pretty!”</p>
<p>And, if we live that way, we might suffer for it. We might lose friends, money, and influence. We might even get ourselves killed.</p>
<p>But Jesus wants our <strong>loyalty</strong>, and he wants our <strong>lives</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="ok-how-do-we-get-there">OK, how do we get there?</h2>
<h3 id="the-first-step-is-to-count-the-cost">The first step is to count the cost.</h3>
<p>Let’s read verses 28-32:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>28 </sup>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? <sup>29 </sup>Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, <sup>30 </sup>saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’</p>
<p><sup>31 </sup>Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? <sup>32 </sup>And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Jesus wants our loyalty and our lives, then it’s a good idea to stop and consider what we’re getting ourselves into before we claim to be his followers!</p>
<p>We need to count the cost, just like the tower-builder or the king going to war.</p>
<p>But, did you catch something else? We’re not just supposed to count the cost for no good reason. No! It’s supposed to teach us something.</p>
<h3 id="were-supposed-to-count-the-cost-and-to-realize-that-we-dont-have-what-it-takes">We’re supposed to count the cost, and to realize that we <em>don’t</em> have what it takes!</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Jesus says, we’re going to get embarrassed if we try and rush into things on our own. We don’t have what it takes.</p>
<p>What a motivational chapel message this is turning out to be! Hate your family and hate yourself, because you don’t have what it takes! Amen?!</p>
<p>Let’s read one more verse, verse 33:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>33 </sup>So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friends, it might not feel like it, but we’ve actually arrived at the good news. Remember, the bad news is that we’re all riding the bandwagon, and that Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-news-is-that-jesus-died-for-bandwagon-followers-like-you-and-me">The good news is that Jesus died for bandwagon followers, like you and me.</h2>
<p>Jesus rose again from the dead for bandwagon followers, like you and me.</p>
<p>And Jesus offers a new life to bandwagon followers, like you and me.</p>
<p>When our loyalty runs out, he remains faithful to us. When we fail, over and over again, to give our own lives meaning, he gives us the love, the purpose, and the meaning in life that we’re searching for.</p>
<p>When we come up short, Jesus carries us through.</p>
<p>Because no, we don’t have what it takes. But he does.</p>
<p>And he delights to give us what it takes to follow him into new, eternal life.</p>
<p>So, even though it’s incredibly hard to get off the bandwagon and pick up our cross, even though it’s really hard to give Jesus complete control over our lives, and to give him ultimate loyalty, above everything and everyone else, <strong>even though it’s the hardest, most difficult thing we will ever do,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Following Jesus is also the easiest, most joyful thing we will ever do.</strong></p>
<p>It’s easier than living life on the bandwagon. Why?</p>
<p>Because you don’t have to <strong>lie</strong> anymore, pretending you’re a follower of Jesus when really you’re the one calling the shots.</p>
<p>You don’t have to exhaust yourself trying to give your own life meaning. It doesn’t all depend on you and your effort and your strength and your skills…</p>
<p>NO, it depends on your Heavenly Father, who created you.</p>
<p>It depends on Jesus Christ, who died and rose again for you.</p>
<p>It depends on the Holy Spirit, who strengthens and empowers you to live life God’s way.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-does-jumping-off-the-bandwagon-to-follow-jesus-really-look-like">So, what does jumping off the bandwagon to follow Jesus really look like?</h2>
<p>Does it have to be this super-emotional, tear-filled conversion experience?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But I think that, for most of us, it’s going to look a lot more <strong>boring</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s why: we’re never going to <strong>become</strong> the people who pick up their crosses and renounce all they have, if we’re not becoming that kind of a person <strong>today</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, we need to pick up the little crosses each day. We need to say the small goodbyes to all we have each day.</p>
<p>What’s this look like? I think it looks like <strong>taking more risks for Jesus</strong>.</p>
<p>You know, it’s crazy. I think I’m more afraid of standing up to peer pressure than standing up to martyrdom!</p>
<p>It’s like, sure, I’ll take a bullet for you, Jesus. But please don’t make me call out my friend for that inappropriate joke,</p>
<p>Sure, I’ll go on that missions trip. But please don’t make me skip the game to go to church.</p>
<p>Sure, I’ll risk my life to spread the gospel. But please don’t make me risk my reputation by reaching out to that weirdo.</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our popularity?</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our athletic accomplishments?</p>
<p>Are we willing to risk our everyday comfort?</p>
<h3 id="what-risk-is-jesus-asking-you-to-take-for-him-right-now-todayu-u">What risk is Jesus asking you to take for him right now, today?<u> </u></h3>
<p>Maybe it’s a conversation you need to have.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s an addiction or habit you need to break.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a fear you need to let go of.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s admitting that, although you really are a Christian, you’ve been riding the bandwagon, and you need to get off.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s admitting that, although you look like a Christian, you’ve only been riding the bandwagon, and you really aren’t following Jesus at all.</p>
<p>That’s a very difficult thing to admit.</p>
<p>But I promise you, you’re better off admitting it <strong>now</strong> than hiding it for years.</p>
<p>Jesus knows who you really are. Jesus knows who <strong>we</strong> really are, all of us.</p>
<p>He doesn’t want bandwagon followers. He doesn’t want people who think they have what it takes to give their lives meaning.</p>
<p>But Jesus is waiting with open arms to catch us, if we’re willing to jump off the bandwagon and follow him.</p>
<p>Are we willing to take the leap? To take the risk?</p>

      <title>Barth, Bonhoeffer, and The Theological Critique of Religion: My Reading List This Fall</title>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-bonhoeffer-the-theological-critique-of-religion-my-reading-list-this-fall/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Read more about my work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-bonhoeffer-and-the-bible/&#34;&gt;Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This semester — my final one at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt; — I’m doing a directed study with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/piotrjmalysz&#34;&gt;Piotr Malysz&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of “Religion” in Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impetus for this study was a discussion question in Dr. Malysz’s Spring 2015 20th Century History and Doctrine course. On March 24, our third class period on Dietrich Bonhoeffer, our second question for discussion read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(Note: Read more about my work on <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-bonhoeffer-and-the-bible/">Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the Bible here</a>.)</em></p>
<p>This semester — my final one at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a> — I’m doing a directed study with <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/piotrjmalysz">Piotr Malysz</a> on the topic of “Religion” in Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer.</p>
<p>The impetus for this study was a discussion question in Dr. Malysz’s Spring 2015 20th Century History and Doctrine course. On March 24, our third class period on Dietrich Bonhoeffer, our second question for discussion read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is religion for Bonhoeffer? What are its anthropological manifestations (in Bonhoeffer’s day)? In what ways is Bonhoeffer’s understanding of religion similar to, and different from, that of Barth?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having taken Malysz’s Fall 2014 seminar on Karl Barth, I was intrigued by the question. We only spent a few minutes on the topic in class, focusing on how Bonhoeffer’s definition of religion focuses on a “necessary God of the gaps,” but I wrote down the following questions for further consideration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a tension in how Barth and Bonhoeffer describe “religion,” or an underlying harmony?</li>
<li>Barth speaks of boundary, Bonhoeffer of finding God at the center. Are they getting at the same thing?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between Barth’s “No-God” and Bonhoeffer’s God as “stopgap”?</li>
</ol>
<p>It has been over a year since that class discussion, but these questions are still on my mind. I’m convinced that Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion can provide resources for the Church today.</p>
<p>In addition to that class discussion question, <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/sdhp/people/profiles/t.greggs">Tom Greggs</a>‘ <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2bWb4cI">Theology Against Religion: Constructive Dialogues with Bonhoeffer and Barth</a></em> [affiliate links throughout] has been an enormous catalyst for this project.</p>
<p>After graduating from Beeson in December, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in historical/systematic theology. If all goes well, I’d like to expand my Barth/Bonhoeffer project this semester into a doctoral project – perhaps focusing on the relationship between Barth’s “No-God” and Bonhoeffer’s “God-as-stopgap,” or on the relationship between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological interpretation[s] of Scripture and their theological critiques of religion.</p>
<h2 id="my-reading-list">My Reading List</h2>

      <title>The Feast of St. James the Apostle: A Homily for Ministers</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-feast-of-st-james-the-apostle-a-homily-for-ministers/</link>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/the-feast-of-st-james-the-apostle-a-homily-for-ministers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Readings: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+34%3B+Jeremiah+16%3A14-21%3B+Mark+1%3A14-20&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34;&gt;Psalm 34; Jeremiah 16:14-21; Mark 1:14-20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many other feast days – scheduled, as they are, on the days of the namesakes’ deaths – the feast day of St. James the Apostle is &lt;strong&gt;a strong rebuke to our aspirations&lt;/strong&gt;. To our aspirations as human beings, and especially to our aspirations as ministers of Christ’s Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, &lt;strong&gt;James started off as a mere fisherman&lt;/strong&gt;. An admirable one, to be sure, because he and his brother John answered Jesus’ call in Mark 1. They left behind their father, their family, and – they grew to hope! – their family’s fishing profession.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="james-amp-john-fishermen-no-more">James &amp; John: Fishermen No More?</h2>
<p>You see, <strong>James started off as a mere fisherman</strong>. An admirable one, to be sure, because he and his brother John answered Jesus’ call in Mark 1. They left behind their father, their family, and – they grew to hope! – their family’s fishing profession.</p>
<p>James was off on a new adventure, hopeful and headstrong. So much so that, along with his brother John, he earned the nickname “<strong>Son of Thunder</strong>”! Coming from the Son of Man, that’s no small compliment!</p>
<p>But their headstrong passion proved to be a <strong>weakness</strong> as well. In Luke 9, after getting rejected in Samaria, the Sons of Thunder offer to call fire down from heaven to consume the Samaritan village! This earns them a stern rebuke from Jesus.</p>
<p>And, even more famously, they approached Jesus with the following request in Mark 10:37:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="princes-or-fishermen">Princes? Or Fishermen?</h2>
<p>Now, their request is, in effect: <strong>“O King Jesus, would you please make us <span style="text-decoration: underline;">princes</span>?”</strong></p>
<p>And, granted, this is <em>Apocryphal</em>, but I imagine Jesus putting his arms around them and saying the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Princes? Princes?! Boys, if I had wanted princes, I would have called princes! But, I don’t need <strong>princes</strong>!</p>
<p>No, no, no. What I need are new <strong>fishermen</strong>! And that’s why I’ve called <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></strong>!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, <strong>James had been hoping for a new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">position</span>. And instead he received his <span style="text-decoration: underline;">old profession</span> – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">transformed</span>!</strong></p>
<h3 id="james-was-no-longer-to-be-a-mere-fisherman-but-a-fisher-of-men">James was no longer to be a mere fisherman, but a fisher of men.</h3>
<p>And not even just a fisher of men like Jeremiah 16 spoke of – for there the fishermen and hunters are instruments of judgment and exile.</p>
<p>No! Instead, James was to go fishing <em>with</em>, go fishing <em>for</em> Jesus, <strong>to bring people back from exile</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="now-undoubtedly-this-is-a-step-up-from-fishing-for-literal-fish">Now, undoubtedly, this is a step up from fishing for literal fish.</h3>
<p><em><strong>Or is it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Not necessarily. At least, not in the world’s eyes.</p>
<h2 id="the-death-of-st-james-the-apostle">The Death of St. James the Apostle</h2>
<p>Here’s Jesus’ actual answer to the “prince” request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”</p>
<p>And they said to him, “We are able.”</p>
<p>And Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, granted, this isn’t one of the assigned lectionary passages for today, but I’d like us to look at the beginning of Acts 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He killed James the brother of John with the sword</span>, and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Swept aside, in just one verse!</strong> I doubt that sort of an abrupt, violent end awaited most of the fishermen working for Zebedee’s family business.</p>
<h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h2>
<p>Was it worth it? Did James receive any sort of a promotion, after all?</p>
<p>Of course, we know the <strong>right</strong> answer. But <strong>do we live it out?</strong></p>
<p>Are we thankful, are we satisfied with our roles as servants within Christ’s Church?</p>
<p>Are we willing to be “just” fishermen, even if it costs us our ambitions? Even if it costs us our lives?</p>

By God’s grace, <strong>I hope so</strong>.</p>
<p>By God’s grace, may we – with the Apostle James – be able to confess the final words of Psalm 34 with open eyes, and open hearts. Perhaps it will help to imagine the following words on the dying Apostle’s lips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<br>
but the Lord delivers him out of them all.<br>
He keeps all his bones;<br>
not one of them is broken.<br>
Affliction will slay the wicked,<br>
and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.<br>
The Lord redeems the life of his servants;<br>
none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <title>Frustrated with Church? You&#39;re the Problem!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I asked you &lt;a href=&#34;http://frustrated&#34;&gt;to join the Church if you, like me, are frustrated with the Church&lt;/a&gt;. The strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community. Plus, your frustrations are likely shared by many others within the Church!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not enough to point the finger at others from your pew, instead of doing so from the public square. Yes, that’s a good first step, but another one is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I asked you <a href="http://frustrated">to join the Church if you, like me, are frustrated with the Church</a>. The strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community. Plus, your frustrations are likely shared by many others within the Church!</p>
<p>However, it’s not enough to point the finger at others from your pew, instead of doing so from the public square. Yes, that’s a good first step, but another one is necessary.</p>
<h5 id="you--and-i--need-to-be-willing-to-take-ownership-for-the-churchs-failures">You – and I – need to be willing to take ownership for the Church’s failures.</h5>
<p>Now, (1) does this mean that we’re to always play the scapegoat, even when the problems aren’t directly our fault? (2) Wouldn’t this open us up to the risk of ignoring the persecution of others by corrupt and power-hungry leaders within the Church?</p>
<p>(1) No, because (2) yes, it potentially could.</p>
<p>What I’m getting at, however, is that <strong>we must always be willing to admit that the Church’s biggest flaws find their roots in the fact that every single churchman and churchwoman is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sinner</span>.</strong></p>
<p>And let’s not kid ourselves – we’re sinners not in the vague, abstract sense of having broken an esoteric list of rules. We are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>concrete sinners</strong></span>, each corrupt, selfish, and violent.</p>
<p>The moment we attempt to distance ourselves from “those sinners over there,” we open ourselves to the risk of committing the very worst sins against others – within and without the Church.</p>
<p>Only when we Christians begin to take ownership for the failings of the Church (of which we are a part) can the Church adopt its most successful posture: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>repentance</strong></em></span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Were the Church to appear before men as a Church under judgement; did it know of no other justification save that which is in judgement; did it believe in the stone of stumbling and rock of offence, instead of being offended and scandalized at it; then, with all its failings and offences – and certainly one day purified of some of them – it would be the Church of God.” ~ Karl Barth, <em>The Epistle to the Romans</em>, 370.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repentance requires the realization that we are under judgement.</p>
<p>When the Church self-righteously condemns the world, it refuses repentance. But the answer is not to join the world and self-righteously condemn the Church! It is rather to model realization and repentance from within the Church.</p>
<p>I’m frustrated with the Church, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I’m</strong></span> the problem.</p>
<p>Are you?</p>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/frustrated-with-church-join-the-club/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;…and by “club” I of course mean “Church”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I getting at? Am I calling the Church a mere “club”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Although, unfortunately, it often feels that way, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A club full of hypocrisy, idolatry, indifference, and platitudes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A club full of power-plays, fear-mongering, and Bible-thumping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A club full of saints too afraid to admit that they are sinners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’re sick of this “club,” and you’re ready to leave, if you haven’t left already.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>No. Although, unfortunately, it often feels that way, doesn’t it?</p>

</ul>
<p>Perhaps you’re sick of this “club,” and you’re ready to leave, if you haven’t left already.</p>
<p>I’m asking you to stay. To come back. To join for the first time.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the Church must be composed of people who realize the Church’s shortcomings and failures.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>is</strong></em></span> <strong>just a club.</strong></p>
<p>I’m asking you to stay, because most leaders within the Church share your frustrations.</p>
<p>Because the strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community.</p>
<p>And because, as I’ll talk about tomorrow, you’re part of the problems. And so am I.</p>
<p>So, let’s work toward solving them together. Within the Church.</p>

      <title>Thank God, I Went to Cedarville</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I prepare for my final semester at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt;, it strikes me just how well I was prepared for my seminary education by my undergraduate professors at Cedarville University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things considered, my time at CU &lt;strong&gt;exposed me to the riches of biblical and theological studies, and it left me hungry for more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College gave me a &lt;strong&gt;love for Christ’s gospel and Christ’s Church&lt;/strong&gt; – which has only increased since I arrived at Beeson.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I prepare for my final semester at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>, it strikes me just how well I was prepared for my seminary education by my undergraduate professors at Cedarville University.</p>
<p>All things considered, my time at CU <strong>exposed me to the riches of biblical and theological studies, and it left me hungry for more</strong>.</p>
<p>College gave me a <strong>love for Christ’s gospel and Christ’s Church</strong> – which has only increased since I arrived at Beeson.</p>
<p>Plus, I met my wife there! 🙂</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pablo-10-300x300.png" alt="pablo (10)"  />
</p>
<p>And yet, college also <em><strong>left a bad taste in my mouth</strong></em>.</p>
<p>See, in the year before I graduated, <a href="https://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">some crazy things went down</a> at my alma mater.</p>
<ul>
<li>It all started with some <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Job-Openings/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">sketchy White Papers</a> getting sprung on the faculty right before contract renewal.</li>
<li>Then, it led to the secret summer firing of a professor.</li>
<li>I reacted <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/">on</a> <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/21/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-2/">my</a> <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/22/an-explanation/">blog</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november/crisis-of-faith-statements.html">Christianity Today</a> picked it up. As well as <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/cedarville-plays-professor-on-leave/nSwDJ/">a local newspaper</a>.</li>
<li>The same day the Christianity Today piece ran, the President “resigned.”</li>
<li>So did the Vice President of Student Life.</li>
<li>You know what? It’s a long story, just <a href="https://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">read it here if you’re interested</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Between my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/">original blogpost</a> and my “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/04/24/a-farewell-to-cedarville/">final farewell,</a>” I tried to take a pretty active role in the student protests against what was going on at CU.</p>
<p>I’d like to think we made a bit of a difference – perhaps in slowing things down enough to let professors find jobs elsewhere before they got fired. Heck, we even made it into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/us/a-christian-college-struggles-to-define-itself.html">The New York Times</a>. (Although, I will say: I’m embarrassed of the picture they chose for the article.)</p>
<p>However, in the long run, <strong>we failed</strong>.</p>
<p>Cedarville is now a much different place than when I arrived. What’s more, I became so entangled in the mess that I arrived to seminary with some burn wounds – from a prophetic fire that burnt a bit too hot.</p>
<p>I’m <strong>thankful</strong> for my time at Cedarville, however.</p>
<p>God has been healing those wounds. Beeson Divinity School and Anglicanism have both been balms to my spirit. And, with the healing has come the realization that I would not be who I am today were it not for my four years in Cedarville, Ohio.</p>
<p>Many of the lessons I learned there were sealed with blood, sweat, and tears – as it were. However, those kinds of lessons are often the most important and enduring.</p>
<p>By God’s grace, I hope to carry forward into my future ministry a combination of prophetic fire and patient faithfulness in the face of injustice and suffering.</p>
<h2 id="heres-the-thing-though-im-worried-about-the-other-members-of-the-cedarville-diaspora">Here’s the thing, though: I’m worried about the other members of the “Cedarville Diaspora.”</h2>
<p>“Cedarville ex-pats”? Take your pick of terms.</p>
<p>No, not so much the professors who were pushed out. They’ve miraculously landed on their feet, and I’ve witnessed God’s powerful work of redemption through them in their current careers and ministries.</p>
<p>No, I’m talking about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>alumni</strong></em></span> who got burned by fundamentalism and may have already <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/08/on-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater-a-message-for-abused-ex-fundamentalists/">thrown out the Christian baby with the fundamentalist bathwater</a>. Or perhaps they’re seriously considering doing so.</p>
<p>See, God has blessed me with a wonderful seminary and church community in which to grow and heal after Cedarville. Without those things, I don’t know where I’d be after the awful ending to my Christian college experience.</p>
<p>Others, however, may be feeling very <strong>lonely</strong> and <strong>angry</strong> right now.</p>
<p><strong>If that’s you, or if you know someone to whom this applies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would you let me know if there’s any way I can help you</span>?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll gladly listen to you vent. I’d love to pray for you specifically, and perhaps to share what I’ve found helpful along the journey.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know what the worst thing about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;dying&lt;/span&gt; itself – its the &lt;strong&gt;separation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, we don’t suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sad reality, to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-if-however-we-could-use-death-to-our-own-advantage&#34;&gt;What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 –&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know what the worst thing about <em><strong>death</strong></em> is?</p>
<p>It’s not the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dying</span> itself – its the <strong>separation</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, we don’t suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.</p>
<p>A sad reality, to be sure.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-however-we-could-use-death-to-our-own-advantage">What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage?</h3>
<p>I’m convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 –</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Eccl-7-2" id="en-NIV-17432">It is better to go to a house of mourning</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">than to go to a house of feasting,</span></span><br>
<span class="text Eccl-7-2">for death is the destiny of everyone;</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">the living should take this to heart.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, obviously, simply taking death to heart isn’t enough to defeat our most ancient enemy. For that, we need (and have been given) a <em><strong>resurrection</strong></em>.</p>
<p>But, have you taken your own death to heart? I believe there’s something to be gained by considering how you’d like to be remembered by others after you die.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-want-to-be-remembered">How do you want to be remembered:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="by-god">by God?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-spouse">by your spouse?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-children">by your children?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-parents">by your parents?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-family-and-friends">by your family and friends?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-colleagues">by your colleagues?</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, I’d like to be remembered:</p>
<ul>
<li>…as God’s faithful servant.</li>
<li>…as my wife’s best friend.</li>
<li>…as my children’s most important teacher.</li>
<li>…as my parents’ legacy.</li>
<li>…as my family and friends’ loyal brother.</li>
<li>…as my colleagues inspiring teammate.</li>
</ul>
<p>…which sounds great, right? But here’s the rub:</p>
<h2 id="what-span-styletext-decoration-underlinechangesspan-do-you-and-i-need-to-make-in-our-lives-to-start-making-those-hypothetical-memories-more-realistic-each-day">What <span style="text-decoration: underline;">changes</span> do you and I need to make in our lives, to start making those hypothetical memories more realistic each day?</h2>
<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on this in the comments below, as I consider how taking death to heart should impact one’s entire life.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to lie. My first reaction when I saw the cover of this book? &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0502.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0502-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

<p><a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a>, bald marketing extraordinaire, is convinced that a paradigm shift has taken place. I’ll quote from his annotated table of contents (which, by the way, I wish all books had):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have gone from two teams (management and labor) to a third team, <strong>the linchpins. These are people who own their own means of production, who can make a difference, lead us, and connect us. The death of the factory means that the entire system we have built our lives around is now upside down. This is either a huge opportunity or a giant threat.</strong> Revolutions are frightening because the new benefits sometimes lag behind the old pain. This time, the opportunity is to bring your best self to the marketplace and be rewarded for it (vii).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the past few generations, we’ve grown used to the implicit deal: If you go to school, learn how to follow instructions, work hard, and show up on time, we’ll take care of you.</p>
<p>But, at least in many sectors, the bargain has fallen apart.</p>
<p>So, Godin advises us to become linchpins in whatever industry we find ourselves. We must treat our work as art, and combine a variety of skills to address complex situations.</p>
<p>We must be able to figure out what to do next, without it being spelled out for us in an instruction manual.</p>
<h2 id="ok-great-but-what-does-this-have-to-do-with-span-styletext-decoration-underlinechurchspan">OK, great. But what does this have to do with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CHURCH</strong></span>?</h2>
<h5 id="i-believe-pastors-are-uniquely-situated-to-be-linchpins"><strong>I believe pastors are uniquely situated to be linchpins.</strong></h5>
<p>They are the leaders of a largely volunteer organization. And, Pastoral Epistles notwithstanding, there is no instruction manual (God forbid we treat the Bible like an instruction manual!).</p>
<p>So they must treat their work as art. If they just phone it in and serve their time, they’ll be left with only the people who phone it in and serve their time as church members!</p>
<h5 id="i-believe-christians-are-uniquely-situated-to-be-linchpins-in-their-workplaces"><strong>I believe Christians are uniquely situated to be linchpins in their workplaces.</strong></h5>
<p>I plan to write more about this in future posts, but it’s ridiculous how much of the self-help advice out there these days aligns with the things Christians should be the very best at!</p>
<p>A bunch of Godin’s advice centers around <strong>treating other people as full human beings, and on giving freely without the expectation of debt or compensation</strong> (See chapters “The Powerful Culture of Gifts” and “The Culture of Connection”).</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but that sounds familiar.</p>
<p>As pastors focus on leading by example – by being linchpins themselves – they could start explicit conversations about the connections between worship on Sunday and work (which should also be worship) on<a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/work"> the other six days</a>.</p>
<h5 id="finally-i-believe-that-each-church-is-uniquely-situated-to-be-a-linchpin-in-its-community">Finally, I believe that each church is uniquely situated to be a linchpin in its community.</h5>
<p>What if churches were known for showing artful, personal, and prodigal love to their communities, without expectation of increased attendance on a Sunday morning?</p>
<p>What if we were seeker-sensitive, without selling out to the “latest” corporate and marketing strategies (which, often enough, rely upon the old paradigm)?</p>
<p>What if, especially in North America, we stopped complaining about “persecution,” and started creatively taking advantage of the situations in which we find ourselves?</p>
<p>I don’t have all the answers to these questions, but I’m convinced they’re worth asking!</p>
<h5 id="godin-is-convinced-that-people-are-starving-for-personal-connection-in-a-world-filled-with-faceless-factories-and-multinational-corporations">Godin is convinced that people are starving for personal connection in a world filled with faceless factories and multinational corporations.</h5>
<h5 id="im-convinced-that-the-church--the-body-of-christ--has-just-the-food-to-feed-those-starving">I’m convinced that the Church – the Body of Christ – has just the food to feed those starving.</h5>

      <title>What are you afraid of?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/what-are-you-afraid-of/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2016 20:02:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/what-are-you-afraid-of/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m scared. Are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, as I wrote in my journal this very morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m scared – I’m scared of wasting my life, I’m scared of not being worth anything outside of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear drives so many aspects of our lives – from how we dress, to how we raise our children, to how we elect our leaders. And, if we’re honest with ourselves, fear can play a large role in what/whom we worship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m scared. Are you?</p>
<p>Specifically, as I wrote in my journal this very morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m scared – I’m scared of wasting my life, I’m scared of not being worth anything outside of the classroom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fear drives so many aspects of our lives – from how we dress, to how we raise our children, to how we elect our leaders. And, if we’re honest with ourselves, fear can play a large role in what/whom we worship.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps we worship God out of a fear of going to hell, or a fear of our inherited religion being wrong. We secretly worry that, like Donald Miller’s father accuses him in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1758575/quotes?item=qt1678309">Blue Like Jazz</a>, we “<em><strong>only believe that stuff ‘cuz [we]’re afraid to hang out with people that don’t</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Or perhaps we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don’t</span> worship God – and instead worship a god of our choice/invention – because we’re afraid of the implications of God’s existence.</p>
<p>Now, there is, I’m persuaded, a holy fear. A salutary reverence and awe in the face of the divine.</p>
<p>But that’s not what I’m talking about here, I’m talking about the <em><strong>paralyzing</strong></em> fear – the cold sweat, the white knuckles, the tension headaches.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the same kind of fear as <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/10/the-power-of-fear.html">Seth Godin</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-power-of-fearhttpsethgodintypepadcomseths_blog201510the-power-of-fearhtml"><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/10/the-power-of-fear.html">The power of fear</a></h3>
<p>Fear will push you to avert your eyes.</p>
<p>Fear will make you think you have nothing to say.</p>
<p>It will create a buzz that makes it impossible to meditate…</p>
<p>or it will create a fog that makes it so you can do nothing but meditate.</p>
<p>Fear seduces us into losing our temper.</p>
<p>and fear belittles us into accepting unfairness.</p>
<p>Fear doesn’t like strangers, people who don’t look or act like us, and most of all, the unknown.</p>
<p>It causes us to carelessly make typos, or obsessively look for them.</p>
<p>Fear pushes us to fit in, so we won’t be noticed, but it also pushes us to rebel and to not be trustworthy, so we won’t be on the hook to produce.</p>
<p>It is subtle enough to trick us into thinking it isn’t pulling the strings, that it doesn’t exist, that it’s not the cause of, “I don’t feel like it.”</p>
<p>When in doubt, look for the fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Courage isn’t the absence of fear. It’s knowing how to deal with fear. And, for me, <strong>the first step toward dealing with my fears is frankly admitting them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m scared, because I don’t know what’s next after I graduate from <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson</a> in December.</li>
<li>I’m scared, because the thing I’ve felt called to for the longest time – getting a PhD in systematic theology – seems like an impractical pipe dream.</li>
<li>I’m scared, because I don’t know if I’ll get into a PhD program. And, if I don’t, I don’t know how I’ll react to not being able to rely upon good grades for self-worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, none of these fears prevent me from being faithful with the day I’ve been given – today. <strong>The greatest failure would be to use fears of the future as an excuse for present faithlessness</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-are-you-afraid-of-how-are-you-dealing-with-those-fears">So, what are you afraid of? How are you dealing with those fears?</h3>
<h3 id="have-you-admitted-them-to-anyone-if-not-i-challenge-you-to-do-so-today">Have you admitted them to anyone? If not, I challenge you to do so today.</h3>
<p>If you’ve got no one, not even a journal, to listen to your admission, I’m all ears, for what it’s worth.</p>

      <title>Kettlebell Swings: Back Balm for the Sedentary [Seminarian]</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/kettlebell-swings-back-balm-for-the-sedentary-seminarian/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2016 23:53:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/kettlebell-swings-back-balm-for-the-sedentary-seminarian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love books. Books, however, do not like my back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you relate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s not sitting around reading books all day, but I imagine plenty of you out there suffer from back pain/fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me share a time-saving solution I’ve recently found: &lt;a href=&#34;http://breakingmuscle.com/kettlebells/how-to-do-the-perfect-kettlebell-swing&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;two-handed kettlebell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;swings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-3810&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34; id=&#34;attachment_3810&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34;&gt;![Our small kettlebell family](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0472-e1464220672909-300x225.jpg)&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34; id=&#34;caption-attachment-3810&#34;&gt;Our small kettlebell family&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can these cannonballs with handles help your back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the kettlebell swing is one of the many exercises out there that activates your &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_chain&#34;&gt;posterior chain&lt;/a&gt; – the muscles along the back of your body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love books. Books, however, do not like my back.</p>
<p>Can you relate?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not sitting around reading books all day, but I imagine plenty of you out there suffer from back pain/fatigue.</p>
<p>Let me share a time-saving solution I’ve recently found: <a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/kettlebells/how-to-do-the-perfect-kettlebell-swing"><em><strong>two-handed kettlebell</strong></em> </a><em><strong>swings.</strong></em></p>
<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3810" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_3810" style="width: 300px">![Our small kettlebell family](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0472-e1464220672909-300x225.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-3810">Our small kettlebell family</figcaption></figure>
<p>How can these cannonballs with handles help your back?</p>
<p>Well, the kettlebell swing is one of the many exercises out there that activates your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_chain">posterior chain</a> – the muscles along the back of your body.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/kettlebells/the-kettlebell-swing-why-its-the-perfect-exercise">BreakingMuscle.com clarifies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for those with lower back issues traditional posterior chain exercises such as deadlifts, good mornings, etc. may exacerbate the condition, while swings may not. For those looking to strengthen the lower back and unable to use these traditional exercises the swing may be just the thing they’re looking for</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the full-body movement of the swing, <strong>you really don’t need to use a lot of weight to feel a difference</strong>. For example, I’ve been squatting 225 lbs. in maintenance mode recently, and after the first day of kettlebell swings with a 35 lb. kettlebell, my glutes and hamstrings were more sore than they’d been in months!</p>
<p>I’ve been very impressed with the results of <a href="http://rkcblog.dragondoor.com/the-best-and-simplest-one-kettlebell-workout/">a basic kettlebell workout</a>, and it will enable me to get exercise at home during the semester, when going to the gym is more of a stretch.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like to give kettlebell swings a try?</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, learn the proper form</strong> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then</span> look for a kettlebell to give it a try.</p>
<p>For the CliffsNotes version, here’s <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2011/01/08/kettlebell-swing/">the Tim Ferriss blogpost on the matter</a>. For a more in-depth approach, BreakingMuscle.com, in addition to their <a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/kettlebells/the-kettlebell-swing-why-its-the-perfect-exercise">article on why the kettlebell swing is such a great exercise</a>, has this piece on <a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/kettlebells/how-to-do-the-perfect-kettlebell-swing">how to do the perfect kettlebell swing</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re more of a visual learner, here’s a helpful instructional video from Eric Moss:</p>
<p><a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_XjJjLc7NE">http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_XjJjLc7NE</a></p>
<p><strong>What weight should you start with?</strong> I began with a 35 lb. (16 kg.). Kettlebells USA has <a href="https://www.kettlebellsusa.com/what-size-kettlebell-should-i-buy-guidelines-for-men-and-women-to-choose-a-starter-kettlebell-weight">one of the best guides on choosing a starting weight</a>, based upon your gender and current fitness level.</p>
<p><strong>What brand of kettlebell should you purchase?</strong> I went with <a href="http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-kettlebell/">Sweethome’s budget pick</a>: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I6CRMP0/">CAP Cast Iron Competition Weight Kettlebell</a>. But, <a href="http://thesweethome.com/reviews/best-kettlebell/">the in-depth review of different brands by Mark Bixby at Sweethome</a> can’t be beat. I like the CAP, but I now agree with his assessment that the grip tears up your hands a bit on one-handed excercises.</p>
<p>Give two-handed kettlebell swings a try! Your back and body will thank you (although, full disclosure, you’ll be sore after the first time).</p>
<p>If you have any comments or questions about kettlebell swings or other methods of easing back pain in the midst of a sedentary lifestyle, please leave them below!</p>

<p>What makes a great wedding?</p>
<p>Is it the fragrance and color of the flower arrangements? The particular grandeur of the venue?</p>
<p>Is it the number and camaraderie of the guests? Or the quality and sound of the music?</p>
<p>Is it the menu at the reception? Or perhaps the selection at the (hopefully open) bar?</p>
<p>I hope it’s not the quality of the sermon!</p>
<p>But, really, <strong>what makes a wedding great?</strong></p>
<p>Surely (gestures toward bride and groom) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">these two</span> have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Is it, perhaps, their physical appearance? His rugged handsomeness? Her stunning beauty?</p>
<p>What about their relationship? Is the wedding great because of the intensity of their love for one another? Their glorious dreams for the future? The optimism of this moment between them?</p>
<p><em><strong>What is it that makes a wedding great?</strong></em></p>
<p>I guess, if most of us had to pick, we’d say that a wedding is great <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if the bride is happy</span>. Right? I mean, even if the weather stinks, the singers are off-key, and the sermon is just absolutely awful – if the bride is happy, everything is OK. Right?</p>
<p>Which is a great reminder that <strong>weddings are about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people</span>, not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">performances</span>.</strong></p>
<p>However, I’m here today to tell you all that, sure, you can have a <em><strong>good</strong></em> wedding if the <em><strong>bride</strong></em> is happy.</p>
<p>But, <strong>if you want a really great wedding – if you want a really great marriage – then it’s really all about the <u>groom</u></strong>.</p>
<h4 id="ugreatu-weddings-might-i-even-say-heavenly-weddings-are-all-about-the-span-styletext-decoration-underlinegroomspan"><u>Great</u> weddings, might I even say <em>heavenly</em> weddings, are all about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>groom</strong></span>.</h4>
<p>Now, either you’re not listening or I’ve probably upset you!</p>
<p>Really? Has the preacher lost his mind? Is he some sort of chauvinist pig?</p>
<p>This is the bride’s big day! That’s why her outfit is more impressive! That’s why we all stand when the bride walks down the aisle!</p>
<p>Are we really going to take this moment away from her and say that it’s all about this handsome chump here?</p>
<p>Well, <strong>no.</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly weddings <em><strong>are</strong></em> all about the groom, but you (gestures to the groom) better <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>not</strong></em></span> use this sermon as an excuse for anything resembling male chauvinism!</p>
<p>Because, for one thing, I’m an egalitarian!</p>
<p>And, for another, I’m not talking about <strong>you</strong> (gestures to groom), <em><strong>her</strong></em> (to bride) bridegroom, but rather to <strong><u>Christ</u></strong>, <em><strong>our</strong></em> (gestures to everyone) bridegroom.</p>
<h4 id="great-weddings-and-great-marriages-are-all-about-christ-our-bridegroom"><strong>Great weddings, and great marriages, are all about Christ, our Bridegroom.</strong></h4>
<p>Take a glance at the Bible readings on your order of service everyone.</p>
<p>Did you catch the names on the wedding invite in Revelation 19? We’re not invited there to this wedding, of this woman to this man, but the wedding of the <strong>Church</strong> to <strong>Christ</strong> himself!</p>
<p>This is the same marriage Paul speaks of in Ephesians 5. In both passages, the Groom, Christ, takes center stage.</p>
<p>You see, in the ancient Jewish culture out of which the Bible came, weddings were done a bit differently.</p>
<p>Modern weddings often center around the arrival of the <strong>bride</strong> to her groom, but these ancient Jewish weddings really hinged on the arrival of the <strong>groom</strong> to his bride.</p>
<p>First, what would happen is the groom would pay the bride’s father her bride price.</p>
<p>After this, the couple was betrothed – legally joined together, although not physically, for they still were not fully married.</p>
<p>Instead, they went their separate ways. He went to prepare their future living quarters as an addition to his father’s household. She went back to her father’s household to prepare <strong>herself</strong> – including the preparation of her beautiful wedding dress.</p>
<p>After the groom had completed their home, he would gather his friends to go and get his bride. She and her companions would have a ballpark idea of when he would come, but the exact hour was a surprise. So, <strong>the bridal party had to stay ready.</strong></p>
<p>This is the scene we read in Matthew 25, where things went <strong>wrong</strong>. Five members of the bridal party were ready for the bridegroom to arrive, but the other five were not ready to join the evening’s lamp-lit procession.</p>
<p>Ideally, the bride and all her friends and family would be awake and ready to join the groom on the journey back to his father’s household and their new living quarters. Once there, the real party began!</p>
<p>Which, by the way, if things have sounded real intense up to this point, let me assure you: these people knew how to party! The wedding celebration would go on for days and days, launching the couple into their new life together.</p>
<p>Now, why in the world am I telling you all this? I mean, first I steal the bride’s thunder, and then I give you a Jewish history lesson?!</p>
<p>Here’s why (looks directly at bride and groom): <strong>your wedding, and your marriage to each other, finds its true meaning and glory as a part of Christ’s Bride – the Church – preparing herself for the Bridegroom’s return.</strong></p>
<h4 id="great-weddings-and-marriages-are-all-about-the-bridegroom"><em><strong>Great weddings and marriages are all about the Bridegroom.</strong></em></h4>
<p>What does that mean for you? Well, as we read in Ephesians 5, it means <strong>you are to love each other sacrificially and humbly</strong>.</p>
<p>After all, our Bridegroom died for us. He cleanses us from sin. And he sets us apart as his holy people. Will your marriage be an image of this kind of love for each other?</p>
<p>Look around the room, you two.</p>
<p>Now look at each other.</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say that you will each bring the other more <strong>joy</strong> than anyone else in this room. However, I think it’s also safe to say that you will cause each other more <strong>pain</strong> than anyone else in this room.</p>
<p>Because you are sinners.</p>
<p>You each, like us all, have fallen short of the glory of God. And marriage is about to make you especially aware of your spouse’s sinful flaws!</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, that’s not the end of the story. Thankfully, <strong>your marriage can point beyond itself</strong>, and therefore be truly <strong>heavenly</strong>.</p>
<p>For you both have been <strong>bought</strong> by the very blood of Christ – a steep bride price if there ever was one!</p>
<p>You have both been <strong>betrothed</strong> to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who is preparing a place for you both in his Father’s household.</p>
<p>And you are therefore both called to <strong>prepare</strong> your wedding garments through holy living – especially in how you <strong>love</strong> one another as husband as wife.</p>
<p>Should you love each other as Christ loves his Bride, your marriage will be a powerful witness – through both laughter and tears – to a world which desperately needs the Bridegroom. It desperately needs the Bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong, and to make everything <strong>new</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you know what that’s going to be like?</p>
<p>It’s going to be like <strong>a wedding banquet</strong>.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21(:2-4), John writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a <em><strong>bride</strong></em> beautifully dressed for her husband.</p>
<p>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.</p>
<p>‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we can anticipate that <strong>joy</strong> and <strong>celebration</strong> at the reception later today!</p>
<p>But we also get a glimpse of what’s coming when we partake of the <strong>Lord’s Supper</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as God has not left the two of your alone, but has blessed you with each other’s companionship, <strong>Jesus has not left his Church on her own</strong>, but promises to <strong>be with her</strong> in the breaking of the bread and the sharing of the wine.</p>
<p>Therefore, every time someone comes into contact with you as a Christ-centered couple, I pray they are reminded of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And every time the two of you, and all of you, partake of the Lord’s Supper, I pray you’ll remember that <strong>heavenly weddings, and the very best marriages, are all about the Bridegroom</strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="what-would-it-have-been-like-on-the-first-holy-saturday"><strong>What would it have been like, on the first Holy Saturday?</strong></h3>
<p>What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?</p>
<p>All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.</p>
<p>And so, some sorry snots get up to try and encourage us. They open up the Hebrew Scriptures and read about our great God.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, when He made the heavens, earth, and humans?</li>
<li>Remember, when He rescued Noah?</li>
<li>Remember, when he stayed Abraham’s knife-laden hand?</li>
<li>Remember, when he rescued us from Egypt?</li>
<li>Remember, when he promised to bring us back from exile, restore our fortunes, and open our… graves?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s too much, too soon. Shut up and sit down! Leave us mourn and weep awhile! Jesus is dead! The one we thought would save us is dead!</p>
<p>It’s been over a day. It’s been almost 2,000 years.</p>
<p><strong>Can these bones live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can these bones live?</strong></p>
<p>The question haunts us. The answer is so obviously “No! Of course not! They’re bones! No flesh, no breath, no life!”</p>
<p>And yet, God asks Ezekiel. And He asks us. Can these bones live?</p>
<p>And sure, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.</p>
<p>Can these bones live? Can <strong>Christ’s</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Surely this question must have flickered in someone’s mind on the first Holy Saturday. And, yes, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.</p>
<p>Look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">world</span>! Dealing in death, day by day. Wars. Famines. Floods. Diseases. Droughts. Death.</p>
<p>Can <strong>these</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Church</span>! Claiming with her lips to follow Jesus Christ, and yet so often proving with her life that she wants no such thing. Scandal. Hypocrisy. Idolatry.</p>
<p>Can <strong>these</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yourselves</span>! I’ll be honest, the question “can these bones live?” is put to every preacher facing a congregation! If the Spirit doesn’t move, I’m throwing hot air at dry bones!</p>
<p>Can <strong>your</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>But then, look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>! Just as scandalous, hypocritical, and idolatrous as any – and yet here I stand, presuming to proclaim the Word of God to you.</p>
<p>Who do I think I am? Can <strong>my</strong> bones live?</p>
<p><strong>Can all these dry, dead bones live?</strong></p>
<p>Friends, there’s a reason why we’re here, though it’s so dark, so late. Sure, it’s to bring in, bright and oh so early, the celebration of Easter.</p>
<p>But it’s also because <strong>keeping vigil is what the Church does every day</strong>. We keep vigil for the sake of a suffering and dying world. We keep watch for our bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong. We stay awake at the world’s late hour, surrounded by so many dry, dead bones.</p>
<p>Can these bones live?</p>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> They can. But, what do they need in order to do so?</p>
<p>First, they need some WATER. Did you notice how often water has appeared in tonight’s readings?</p>
<ul>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">creation</span>, out of which God called the dry ground – out of which He formed human beings.</li>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">judgment</span>, through which God saved Noah and his family in the Ark.</li>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">redemption</span>, through which God rescued Israel from the Egyptian house of slavery.</li>
<li>And the waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cleansing</span>, by which the Lord promised in the prophets to wash away His people’s guilty stains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Water, water, everywhere! Except the dry valley.</p>
<p>I think the dry bones need some sort of <strong>water</strong>.</p>
<p>They also need some sort of SPIRIT. You know, God’s Spirit, His breath, His wind, who hovered over the waters at creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who filled the first humans with life.</li>
<li>Who led God’s people.</li>
<li>Who inspired and preserved the words of Scripture we read this evening.</li>
<li>Who rushed upon the dry bones in Ezekiel’s vision – making them into a great army, alive!</li>
</ul>
<p>Dry bones need the <strong>Spirit</strong>.</p>
<p>But, the question isn’t “Can these bones get <strong>wet</strong> and <strong>windy</strong>?” It’s “Can they <strong>LIVE</strong>?!”</p>
<p>And, if they’re going to live, they’re going to need a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>RESURRECTION</strong></em></span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>They need the defeat of their most ancient enemy: Death!</li>
<li>They need Death’s reversal! They need Death’s death!</li>
<li>They need exactly what God promised Ezekiel: to open their graves, and lift them up, living!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amen! Glory, glory, hallelujah!</strong></p>
<p>But, if I hear Ezekiel’s glorious vision read at the first Holy Saturday, I’m tempted to <strong>lose it</strong> at this point. To bitterly ask those gathered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>When</strong>?! That sounds great, but <strong>when</strong>?! <strong>When</strong> is God going to do this?!</p>
<p>For over <strong>five hundred years</strong> since Ezekiel, we’ve been falling into our graves over and over again – and staying there! Sure, it’s no longer in Babylon, but we’ve been invaded and harassed and dominated here in Judah ever since!</p>
<p>Is it really that much better to fall into the grave under Rome’s heavy heel, like Jesus?</p>
<p>Why not Babylon’s?</p>
<p>Why not Assyria’s?</p>
<p>Heck, why not Pharaoh’s?</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> is God going to turn things around?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, I wasn’t in the audience back then. But we’re here, tonight. And maybe you’re similarly tempted to lose it and freak out sometimes in church!</p>
<p>All this pretty Jesus-talk, when for over 2,000 years the Church has travailed in the midst of a deadly and dying world.</p>
<p>We thank Jesus for our oversized meals, cars, and houses, while thousands fall into their graves around us – tired, hungry, destitute, and alone.</p>
<p>So, on the first Holy Saturday and the 2,000th, the question is roughly the same:</p>
<p><strong>When</strong>?! <strong>When</strong> is God going to turn things around?!</p>
<p>And the answer is likewise the same. We sang it, earlier:</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS THE NIGHT.</strong></p>
<p>When did God open the grave?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>THIS IS THE NIGHT</strong>, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <strong>can these bones live? Yes!</strong></p>
<p>Can <strong>Christ’s</strong> bones live? Yes! For on this night, some 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ got up from the tomb. He was alive. He was dead. But he is now alive again.</p>
<p>Can <strong>our</strong> bones live? Yes!</p>
<p>How? Because Christ has provided the <strong>resurrection</strong>, the <strong>Spirit</strong>, and the <strong>water</strong> we need.</p>
<p>Because, through the waters of <strong>baptism</strong>, we receive the Spirit and the resurrection.</p>
<p>Now, we aren’t going to baptize anyone tonight. We’ll have to wait until later this morning to do so. But we are about to renew our baptismal vows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>preserved</strong>, like Noah, from the waters of Sin and Death, in the Ark, the Church.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>ransomed</strong> and rescued, like Israel, through the waters of the Red Sea.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>cleansed</strong> with the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, as God promised through Isaiah and Ezekiel.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>buried</strong> with Christ in his death, and are <strong>raised</strong> with him in newness of life.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>empowered</strong> and <strong>emboldened</strong> to <strong>proclaim</strong> the good news to a desperate world that JESUS CHRIST IS RISEN.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we can assure the world that their bones can live, because <strong>Christ has died</strong>.</p>
<p>We can rest assured that our bones can live, because <strong>Christ is risen</strong>.</p>
<p>And we can keep watch for the sake of a suffering world, because <strong>Jesus Christ will come again</strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <title>Reading Recommendations? Barth&#39;s and Bonhoeffer&#39;s False Gods</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/reading-recommendations-barths-bonhoeffers-false-gods/</link>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/reading-recommendations-barths-bonhoeffers-false-gods/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi internet – especially all you Barthians and Bonhoefferians (-ites?) out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the process of compiling a reading list, and I could use your suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my goal: &lt;strong&gt;to explore the possible relationship between Barth’s critique of the “No-God”&lt;/strong&gt;(Nich-Gott) &lt;strong&gt;and Bonhoeffer’s critique(s) of viewing God as a “stopgap”&lt;/strong&gt; (Lückenbüßer) &lt;strong&gt;or “working hypothesis.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as primary sources go, I plan to focus on the &lt;em&gt;Romans&lt;/em&gt; commentary, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098&#34;&gt;Garrett Green’s recent re-translation of &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;CD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098&#34;&gt; §17&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Letters and Papers from Prison&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi internet – especially all you Barthians and Bonhoefferians (-ites?) out there.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of compiling a reading list, and I could use your suggestions.</p>
<p>Here’s my goal: <strong>to explore the possible relationship between Barth’s critique of the “No-God”</strong>(Nich-Gott) <strong>and Bonhoeffer’s critique(s) of viewing God as a “stopgap”</strong> (Lückenbüßer) <strong>or “working hypothesis.”</strong></p>
<p>As far as primary sources go, I plan to focus on the <em>Romans</em> commentary, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098">Garrett Green’s recent re-translation of </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098"><em>CD</em></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098"> §17</a>, and <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em>.</p>
<p>As for secondary sources, right now I’m starting the list with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theology-against-Religion-Constructive-Bonhoeffer/dp/0567104230/">Tom Greggs’ <em><strong>Theology Against Religion</strong></em></a>. I’ve read this twice now, and it has been a major inspiration for the project.</p>
<p>I’ve also got my eye on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bonhoeffers-Theological-Formation-Protestant-Theology/dp/0199639787/">Michael DeJonge’s <em><strong>Bonhoeffer’s Theological Formation</strong></em>,</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theology-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Ernst-Feil/dp/0800662407/">Ernst Feil’s <em><strong>The Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer</strong></em></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Karl-Barth-Theology-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer/dp/080284281X/">Andreas Pangritz’s <em><strong>Karl Barth in the Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer</strong></em></a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Religionless-Christianity-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Troubled/dp/0567032590/">Jeffrey Pugh’s <em><strong>Religionless Christianity</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>I’m also working my way through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theology-Resource-Christian-Religions-Systematic/dp/0567666727/">Sven Ensminger’s <em><strong>Karl Barth’s Theology as a Resource for a Christian Theology of Religions</strong></em></a>. While this looks very helpful for a larger project on Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the theological critique of religion, <strong>I’m still looking for sources that deal more directly with Barth’s “No-God” and Bonhoeffer’s God as “stopgap” or “working hypothesis.”</strong></p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-any-reading-recommendations-for-me"><em><strong>Do you have any reading recommendations for me?</strong></em></h3>
<p>OR, even better: Have any of you translated Hans-Joachim Kraus’ <em><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theologische-Religionskritik-Neukirchener-systematischen-Theologie/dp/3788706724/">Theologische Religionskritik</a></strong></em> into English yet? Because that would be fantastic.</p>

      <title>Three Recent Sermons</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/three-recent-sermons/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a grueling past few weeks at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson&lt;/a&gt;. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can’t come quickly enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have preached twice in the past month on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032&#34;&gt;Psalm 32&lt;/a&gt;. First, I delivered a sermon (“The Refreshment of Forgiveness”) designed for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearC_RCL/Lent/CLent4_RCL.html&#34;&gt;Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C&lt;/a&gt;, for Dr. Doug Webster’s Preaching Practicum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a grueling past few weeks at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson</a>. Our Spring Break happens to coincide with Holy Week this year, and it can’t come quickly enough!</p>
<p>Part of the hard work has been preparing to preach three sermons for class. However, the opportunity to study and preach God’s Word is a joy that outweighs the burdens of preparation!</p>
<p>I have preached twice in the past month on <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032">Psalm 32</a>. First, I delivered a sermon (“The Refreshment of Forgiveness”) designed for the <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearC_RCL/Lent/CLent4_RCL.html">Fourth Sunday in Lent, Year C</a>, for Dr. Doug Webster’s Preaching Practicum.</p>

<p>Then, I preached/presented on the same passage for Dr. Allen Ross’s Exegesis of Psalms (“Psalm 32: Psalm 1 for Screw-Ups”).</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248878329″ params=”color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>
<p>Preparing and preaching these very <strong>different</strong> sermons on the <strong>same</strong> passage was a good reminder of the inexhaustible richness of Scripture.</p>
<p>Most recently, I got to compose a “crisis sermon” for Dr. Webster’s Preaching Practicum (“Lamenting into Worship”). One of my classmates preached a post-9/11 sermon. Another, post-Pearl Harbor! These were great sermons, but I chose a different route: <strong>preaching to a congregation after the death of a well-known church family’s baby</strong>.</p>
<p>[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249874403″ params=”color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false” width=”100%” height=”166″ iframe=”true” /]</p>
<p>This was a stretching experience, to say the least. I pray I never have to preach this sermon in real life, but it was a good reminder to preach the good news to myself that God hates death more than we do.</p>
<p>You can listen to and/or read “The Refreshment of Forgiveness,” “Psalm 1 for Screw-Ups,” and “Lamenting into Worship,” along with my other sermons <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/sermons/">at the <strong>Sermons Page</strong> of this site</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there are much better preachers out there in the world, so if you’re short on time, go listen to them preach! But, if you’ve got the time to give these sermons a listen, I would greatly appreciate your <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/contact/"><strong>feedback</strong> </a>as I try to improve as a preacher and teacher of God’s Word!</p>

      <title>Improvising Church and State: Overaccepting as a Synthesis of Anglican and Anabaptist Approaches</title>

&lt;p&gt;From the church’s perspective, is the state a promising offer, or a threatening one?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="introduction-accepting-blocking-and-status">INTRODUCTION: ACCEPTING, BLOCKING, AND STATUS</h3>
<p>From the church’s perspective, is the state a promising offer, or a threatening one? At the risk of breathtaking oversimplification, Anglicans have tended to adopt the former perspective, leading to accommodation, and Anabaptists the latter, resulting in separation.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Following Samuel Wells in his theological appropriation of terms from theatrical improvisation, the Anglican tradition has tended to respond to the promising <em>offers</em> (invitations to respond) of the state by <em>accepting</em> – maintaining the premise(s) of the state’s action(s).<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> The historical legacy of the Church of England has given Anglicanism, as Anderson notes, an “inheritance of a strong loyalty to the state and a conservatism that has led the church to promote the status quo more often than it agitates for reform.”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> This inheritance from the established Church of England has coincided with a dual tendency to adopt a high <em>status</em> (a strategy for getting one’s way), in terms of relative privilege and political optimism, and a low status, in terms of frequent subservience in church-state relations.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/">Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?</a>“)</p>
<p>However, the Anabaptist tradition has tended to respond to the threatening offers of the state by <em>blocking</em> – undermining the premise(s) of the state’s action(s).<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> For many contemporary Anabaptists, as Joireman summarizes, “[T]he state has the function of ordering the social world, and the church should be the visible witness of believers, the primary affiliation of Christians, and separate from the state.”<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Passively, blocking the state can be “a choice to shut oneself away and keep oneself unsullied by the world.”<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> Most often, drawing upon their sixteenth-century inheritance of facing persecution from Catholics and Protestants alike, Anabaptists have adopted a low status as somewhat of a fringe movement. Actively, however, blocking can be “a choice to take up arms,” as seen during the (admittedly rare) example of high status Anabaptist opposition during the Münster Rebellion of 1534.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<h3 id="questioning-givens">QUESTIONING GIVENS</h3>
<p>The differences between accepting and blocking are apparent in the Anglican Articles of Religion of 1563 and the Anabaptist Schleitheim Confession of 1527. Although the former document, in article 37 (“Of the Civil Magistrates”), restricts administration of Word and Sacraments to the Church alone, it grants the monarch “the chief power in this Realm of <em>England</em>, and other his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil,” claiming that Scripture grants monarchs the authority to “rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.” Article 37 also accepts the death penalty and Christian military service.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> In contradistinction, the Schleitheim Confession forbids Christian participation in civic affairs, swearing oaths, bearing the sword, and serving as a magistrate.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>In interpreting these texts, we must remember that, as Bell notes, “[I]t is anachronistic to speak of the church and the state as if these were two distinct social entities prior to the advent of modernity.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> And the subsequent historical realities of both movements have been much more complex and nuanced than the glaring differences between these two documents would suggest. Nevertheless, a political-theological impasse seems to exist between the two traditions, and I argue that both Anglican and Anabaptist movements – to the extent that they have engaged in the kinds of socio-political accepting and blocking sketched above – share a common weakness, which Wells’ improvisation framework highlights. Both are prone to accept the realities of the state as a <em>given</em>: a nonnegotiable fact of existence that must be either accepted (by Anglicans) or rejected (by Anabaptists).<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>For example, in his explanation of the thirty-seventh Article of Religion, Bray demonstrates an Anglican acceptance of sinful socio-political realities as given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like it or not, the world is in the grip of Satan and secular rulers who are Christians must come to terms with that fact. It is all very well to believe in peace, but pacifism is not a realistic option in a fallen creation. There have always been groups of Christians who have advocated it, but they have only been able to exist and maintain their principles because they are small and because the majority has been prepared to tolerate them.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, though it disagrees on the corresponding duties of the church, the Schleitheim Confession agrees with the givenness of state violence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sword is ordained of God outside the perfection of Christ. It punishes and puts to death the wicked, and guards and protects the good. In the Law the sword was ordained for the punishment of the wicked and for their death, and the same [sword] is [now] ordained to be used by the worldly magistrates (Article 6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resulting disagreements between Anabaptists and Anglicans frequently take place on the level of either accepting or blocking the state, not questioning the state itself as a given.</p>
<p>Wells is right to invert the normal relationship between givens and gifts when it comes to Christian ethics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God takes the place in Christian ethics normally reserved for time, death, sin, bodily limitation[, socio-political realities], and so on – the conventional boundaries. The only boundary, in other words, is the boundary of God. And meanwhile the place that God conventionally takes in Christian ethics – that of a perhaps helpful but largely peripheral and certainly not essential figure – in other words, a gift, a ‘bonus’ – should be taken by those familiar perennial so-called ‘givens.’ […] [T]he only given is God’s story, the theo-drama, the church’s narrative: all else is potentially gift.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the state is indeed an actor within the theo-drama, the “five-act play of God” (creation, Israel, Jesus, church, eschaton), the church must remember that the state’s role pertains only from the fall and until the eschaton.<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> Arguably, Anglicans have overemphasized Act Two (Israel) in accepting the state, by tending to read the Old Testament (rather than Christ) as a model for political theology.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> And Anabaptists have perhaps overemphasized Act Five (eschaton) in blocking the state, when, for instance, “Mennonites have sacrificed the study of politics, and this has led to a lack of sophistication in efforts to advocate for the worldwide church and an ineffectiveness in efforts to promote development and the well-being of Christians around the globe.”<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> Both traditions, at their worst, have defined politics as mere <em>statecraft</em> – the management of “a centralized power holding monopoly on violence within a defined territory,” a “civil society.”<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> Anglicans tend to join in the statecraft, and Anabaptists are more likely to withdraw.</p>
<h3 id="incorporating-gifts-and-forming-habits">INCORPORATING GIFTS AND FORMING HABITS</h3>
<p>There is a way beyond the impasse between accepting and blocking the state: <em>overaccepting</em> it. As Wells defines it: “Overaccepting is accepting in light of a larger story,” in this case, the five-act story of God. To translate Wells’ language into the current topic, the Anglican risk of accepting is that the church “will be determined by the [state] and thus lose [its] integrity and identity.” The Anabaptist risk of blocking is that the church “will seal [it]self off from the world and thus lose [its] relevance in humanity.” However, “Overaccepting is an active way of receiving that enables one to retain both identity and relevance. It is a way of accepting without losing the initiative.”<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> It therefore offers the possibility of a synthesis between Anabaptist and Anglican approaches to the <em>gift</em> of the state.</p>
<p>Overaccepting involves the realization that politics is not primarily about statecraft, but about true power and a just community. The church already has something to say about both. To the former, it confesses that “Jesus is Lord,” and that the most significant power-act in history has already occurred in Act Three of God’s five-act play. To the latter, it maintains that true community and communal justice are to be found in fellowship with the Triune God – a fellowship which takes place now in Act Four through Word and Sacrament, the church’s life of worship, in anticipation of Act Five. The church must therefore become <em>more political</em>, not less. As Cavanaugh rightly states: “The role of the church is not merely to make policy recommendations to the state, but to embody a different sort of politics, so that the world may be able to see a truthful politics and be transformed.”<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p>Although a more political church sounds superficially similar to Anglican accepting, overaccepting the state involves countering the state’s apparent givenness – its myth of politics as community-through-dominion – by out-narrating it into the true givenness of God’s story, and remembering that the church, not the state, is catholic.<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a> Therefore, this approach resembles the Anabaptist view of the church and the state, as Joireman puts it, “as separate and unequal, with an elevation of the church over the state.”<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> Nevertheless, the church’s overaccepting of the state is not the same as blocking through withdrawal. The church is public and political for the sake of the world, whose socio-political realities can be overaccepted as gifts, not givens.<a href="#_ftn23">[23]</a> As Bell clarifies, this need not lead to “a wholesale rejection of other political formations like modern states and civil society,” for it is possible that some forms of statecraft may serve the church “by maintaining an order that enables the church to carry out its properly public and political mission, which is the proclamation and ingathering of the true human communion/community.” Overaccepting the state can thereby overcome the weaknesses of both traditions and exploit their strengths.</p>
<p>In its liturgical worship, the church already has the resources to live a habitual life as a true polity for the sake of the world – even though liturgical manifestations differ between Anglicans and Anabaptists. The truly political worship that takes place in the church’s liturgy is, as Wannenwetsch clarifies, “meant neither to merely mirror existing political structures and procedures not to provide them with a religious rationale, but rather represents the unique politics of God.”<a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> Through Word and Sacrament, the church reminds the world (and itself), that true politics is not found in wielding dominion, but in worshipping <em>Dominum Iesum Christum</em>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-reincorporating-the-lost">CONCLUSION: REINCORPORATING THE LOST</h3>
<p>One final way in which Anabaptists and Anglicans can unite in their approaches to the state is by entering the public sphere to advocate for the many victims of statecraft. During this, the Fourth Act of God’s story, the world’s false sense of politics has made a bloody habit of trampling upon exactly the kinds of people who will be exalted in Act Five to God’s heavenly banquet: widows, orphans, immigrants, and refugees. As Wells poignantly maintains: “The church has got to get used to the faces of the poor, because it will see them on the thrones in Act Five.”<a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> The church’s test of the state’s offer is therefore liturgical: does the state resemble the liturgy by creating a polity in which the victims of statecraft can flourish? For that matter, does the church itself embody such a liturgy worth resembling? Very often, the answer is “no.”</p>
<p>And yet, by the grace of God, this depressing given can be received as a gift, if these people are received as God’s gifts. Christians – Anabaptists, Anglicans, and others – can enter the public sphere and invite the oppressed to leave the ghettos, refugee camps, and killing fields into which they have been discarded by the world’s statecraft. We can eschew the twin errors of accommodation and separation, and instead invite these “others” to become “us” – to cross the borders, which states have erected to cling to their false and fear-driven dominions, and to enter into the true polity and politics of the Triune God.</p>
<h3 id="notes">===NOTES===</h3>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Rowland briefly describes the “complex oscillations between accommodation and separation” throughout church history, citing Anglicanism as an example of the former and Anabaptists of the latter. <strong><u>Note</u></strong>: if this oversimplification is too breathtaking, please substitute “Anglicans” with “accomodationists” and “Anabaptists” with “separationists” throughout. See Christopher Rowland, “Scripture: New Testament,” in <em>The Blackwell Companion to Political Theology</em>, eds. Peter Scott and William T. Cavanaugh (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2004), 21.</p>
<p>Due to length requirements, my analysis of these two Christian traditions will be primarily theoretical and theological. For a better historical analysis of Anglican and Anabaptist views on the relationship between church and state than I can provide in this paper, see, among others: Leah Seppanen Anderson, “The Anglican Tradition: Building the State, Critiquing the State,” in <em>Church, State, and Citizen: Christian Approaches to Political Engagement</em>, ed. Sandra F. Joireman (New York, NY: Oxford, 2009), 93-114; Peter Hinchliff, “Church-State Relations,” in <em>The Study of Anglicanism</em>, eds. Stephen Sykes, John Booty, and Jonathan Knight, rev. ed. (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 1998), 392-405; and Sandra F. Joireman, who provides an extensive Anabaptist bibliography in “Anabaptists and the State: An Uneasy Coexistence,” in <em>Church, State, and Citizen: Christian Approaches to Political Engagement</em>, ed. Sandra F. Joireman (New York, NY: Oxford, 2009), 73-91.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a> Anderson, 104. Hinchliff provides a thorough examination of this historical legacy, before concluding that “historically, establishment has tended to make the Church, at least in some respects, the servant of the state. It might be thought, then, that the Anglican tradition would have been one which was conservative politically and disinclined to challenge the government. This has not, however, been the universal pattern.” He then cites a few examples which give nuance to the portrait of Anglicanism. However, the strong sense remains that the dominant Anglican approach has been politically conservative in terms of state loyalty. Hinchliff, 404.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theology is confusing enough, much more so when you attempt to summarize it all in a single essay! Nevertheless, such was my assignment in seminary in 2015. Here are the results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“At the centre of Christian faith is the history of Christ. At the centre of the history of Christ is his passion and his death on the cross.” ~ Jürgen Moltmann&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>We believe that, during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, God died on a Roman cross.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> We also believe that, the third day thereafter, Jesus of Nazareth – the same person who had been crucified – rose again from the dead.</p>
<p>How can these things be?</p>
<p>How can the immortal, transcendent, omnipotent One come to a weak, immanent end?</p>
<p>How can a dead human leave his grave, living?</p>
<p>At this point, we face a crucial choice between:</p>
<ol>
<li>the posited “God” of metaphysical theism and</li>
<li>the revealed God of the Christian faith.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Should we choose the <em>former</em>, our Christ, canon, and confession are irreducibly <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>docetic</strong></em></span> – the true “God” is aloof, and merely play-acting, at best.</p>
<p>Yet, should we choose the <em>latter</em>, God is irreducibly, ineluctably Triune – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe, we <strong>trust</strong> that the Triune God is who God has revealed Godself to be.</p>
<h2 id="the-holy-trinity-the-main-characters-of-theology">THE HOLY TRINITY: The Main Character(s) of Theology</h2>
<p>The narrative of <strong>Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.”</strong><a href="#_ftn4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Andrej_Rubl%C3%ABv_001.jpg" alt="Icon of the Holy Trinity, the main character(s) in Christian theology"  />
</p>
<p>These three <em>dramatis personae Dei</em>, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a <em>persona</em> in Israel’s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.”<a href="#_ftn5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>YHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the <strong>Father</strong> by virtue of Jesus’ address of him as such.<a href="#_ftn6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a></li>
<li>The <strong>Son</strong> is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address.<a href="#_ftn7"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a></li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>Spirit</strong> appears as a <em>persona</em> of the story, first in the OT as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the NT as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church.<a href="#_ftn8"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, Jesus of Nazareth prayed to God, calling him Father. Yet this Son of God, confessed by Christians as “very God of very God” (Niceno-Constantinopolitan [Nicene] Creed), also cried out to the Father: “<strong>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</strong>” (Mark 15:34).</p>
<p>As Jenson rightly observes: “Therewith it becomes problematic that anything specified by listing ‘Father, Son, and Holy Spirit’ can be one God and not rather a mutually betraying pantheon.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>A simple solution to this problem of God’s unity would be to maintain that either <strong>just one</strong> (Subordinationism) or <strong>none</strong> (Modalism) of the three identities mentioned is <em>really</em> God. However, because the Church trusts Scripture as divine revelation, it believes that it knows the real God, whom it worships – delusion, according to Modalism. Furthermore, the Church worships all three divine Persons – idolatry, according to Subordinationism.</p>
<p><strong>We believe that we can truly know God in revelation, that God can give Godself to be known as an object, because God is first known by Godself – as Subject (Father), Object (Son), and Act of Revelation (Holy Spirit).<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></strong></p>
<p>In order to do justice to worship and the Word of God (or better, worship <em><u>of</u></em> the Word of God: Jesus), the Church confesses “that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed">Athanasian Creed</a>). One in three, three in one: Father, Son, and Spirit – each Person equally and essentially God, and yet each distinct from the other two.</p>
<p><strong>What about the “mutually betraying pantheon” revealed in Christ’s cry of dereliction?</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, the Spirit preserves God’s unity at the most frayed moment – maintaining the bond of love between the forsak<em>ing</em> Father and the forsak<em>en</em> Son, a love so powerful it conquered death.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> Through the power of the Holy Spirit, Christ is <em><strong>raised</strong></em> from the grave, <em><strong>revealed</strong></em> to be who he has always been: the Son of God (Rom. 1:4), and thereby <em><strong>restored</strong></em> to the Father.</p>
<p>The Trinity is one God, not three, because it is concerned with “a relationship between persons in which these persons constitute themselves in their relationship with each other.”<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> The doctrine of the Trinity holds together Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – as well as Crucifixion and Resurrection.</p>
<p>And yet, we are still faced with the difficulty of the Incarnation: <strong>how can the eternal God be so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">temporal</span>, the transcendent One so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immanent</span>?</strong></p>
<p>(For more on the Trinity, see my essay: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/">“The Holy Trinity: What Is It? (Why) Is It Important?”</a>)</p>
<h2 id="election-amp-creation">ELECTION &amp; CREATION</h2>
<p>There is no escape from time, not even for God. The Trinity holds together not just Crucifixion and Resurrection, but time itself.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p>“<strong>Eternal</strong>” most properly means “without beginning, without end,” and not “<strong>timeless</strong>,” which means “without past, present, or future.”</p>
<p><strong>If we remove “timeless” from our definition of God’s eternality, the Trinity’s identification of itself with its temporal <em>opera ad extra</em> poses less of a theological threat (to divine transcendence), beginning with its first external work: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">election</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Or is it <strong>creation</strong>?</p>
<p>Barth is right to expose the dialectical relationship between the two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The creation of God, and therefore His positing of a reality distinct from Himself, is the external basis and possibility of the covenant. And the covenant itself is the internal basis and possibility of creation, and therefore of the existence of a reality distinct from God” (CD III/2, 204).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creaturely form and covenant content of the Triune God’s external works find their basis in the election of Jesus as the nexus of God and humanity – <strong>Christ is the electing God and the elected human, before the act of creation.</strong></p>
<p>That Jesus exists as the elect(ing) God-human before humanity itself exists – that <strong>he can precede himself, as it were</strong> – is but an illustration of <strong>the Triune God’s temporal transcendence, which is not threatened by (but rather displayed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through</span>) immanence.</strong></p>
<p>By, for, and to Jesus Christ “the universe is created as a theatre for God’s dealings with man and man’s dealings with God” (CD II/2, 94). Without a fully-orbed view of the Trinity, this extension outward from Godself to that which is not God, from Creator to creature, seems <strong>arbitrary</strong>. And yet, while God’s freedom can never be reduced to mere <span style="text-decoration: underline;">necessity</span>, the eternal love which characterizes the life of the Trinity makes God’s free decision to elect and create most <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>fitting</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Through Christ, there is a correspondence between the existence and love of God <em>ad intra</em> – between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – and the existence and love of God <em>ad extra</em> to humanity.</strong></p>
<p>Humanity only exists within this Christological correspondence, on the basis of a shared sphere with Christ.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> Therefore, “to be a man is to be with God,” for no matter what else each individual is, “he is on the basis of the fact that he is with Jesus and therefore with God” (CD III/2, 135). <strong>The Incarnation grounds anthropology in the Triune God’s address to humanity through Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<h2 id="reconciliation">RECONCILIATION</h2>
<p>However, the Incarnation also yields the clearest view of sin’s absurdity.</p>
<p><strong>Although the distinction between Creator and creation entails the <em>possibility</em> of creaturely conflict with God, it does not necessitate <em>actual sin</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Given the Christological and theological basis of human existence, <strong>it makes no sense</strong> for a human to actualize this possibility, for “if he denies God, he denies himself” and “chooses his own impossibility” (CD III/2, 136).</p>
<p>Just as there is no God behind God, there is no humanity beyond the divine summons, beyond existence in the same sphere inhabited by Christ. It is therefore unthinkable that humanity should try to be the source of its own existence, and yet this is precisely that which occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, sin is not merely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">moral</span> – it is both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ontological</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">incomprehensible</span></strong>: the inherent contradiction of a nothingness which opposes God as the very ground of all existence and reality.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-cross-and-the-empty-tomb">Back to the Cross and the Empty Tomb</h2>
<p>Pardon the cyclical nature of this discussion, but it is time to return to the Crucifixion and Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>Why did God the Father forsake?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why was God the Son forsaken?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did the Spirit need to overcome the divine distancing?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to these questions begins with the eternal (before creation, but not timeless) election of Jesus Christ – for <strong>he is not just the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">electing</span> God and elected human, but also the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">damned</span> human and the damned God.</strong></p>
<p>Election is therefore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>double</strong></span>, in that (1) God elects unto <em><strong>Godself</strong></em>, through Jesus Christ, the incomprehensible nothingness – the terrible “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">No</span>” – that is the inevitable outworking of human sin. However, (2) God elects unto <em><strong>humanity</strong></em>, through Jesus Christ, the unmerited invitation – the wonderful “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yes</span>” – into the love and life of the Triune God.</p>
<p><strong>An eternal exchange. A “Yes” and a “No.”</strong></p>
<p>This is all beginning to sound rather <em>timeless</em>.</p>
<p>And yet, a proper appreciation of the <em><strong>timeliness</strong></em> of the Trinity is necessary to make sense of the divine revelation we have actually received, <strong>for the Bible contains but an account of the Trinity’s external works in the midst of time – first through the story of Israel, and then through the story of the Church.</strong><a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<h2 id="the-story-of-scripture">THE STORY OF SCRIPTURE:</h2>
<p>Between creation and the Incarnation lies the story of <strong>ISRAEL</strong>, lamentably overlooked in many formulations of the Christian faith.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Despite the invasion of <strong>SIN</strong> (Gen. 3) – which ruptured the perfect relationships between God and humanity, humanity and itself, and humanity and the rest of creation (with ontological implications, as mentioned above) – God does not abandon creation to its exile. Neither does God instantaneously fix things. Instead, <strong>God takes time.</strong></p>
<p>God calls Abraham and the nation of Israel back to unity with himself through <strong>COVENANT</strong>. He endeavors to pull them – and through them as a priestly nation, the world – back from the ruptured relationships into covenantal fellowship and oneness.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>However, the faithless Israelites repeatedly eschew the loving faithfulness of their God, leading to the <strong>EXILE</strong> of the nation.<a href="#_ftn18"><sup><sup>[18]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>In fulfillment of God’s eternal election, at the <strong>INCARNATION</strong>, the Trinity stretches through the Son to meet all humanity – as a Jewish man in the midst of Israel – in its state of partial exile, to fulfill the global mission of Israel.<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>As God enters our midst as Jesus Christ, he pushes us to the side in our perverted attempts to secure our own existence.<a href="#_ftn20"><sup><sup>[20]</sup></sup></a> Without succumbing to sin’s siren call, he is fully affected by it, bringing sinful human nature into the life of God and thereby intensifying the divine reaction against it into an ultimate tension.<a href="#_ftn21"><sup><sup>[21]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p><strong>The one ultimately worthy <em><u>to</u></em> exile is now also the one ultimately worthy <em><u>of</u></em> exile.</strong></p>
<p>Once more, to the <strong>CROSS</strong>. There, the Trinity stretches to the utmost, as the Son of God, worthy to mete out the sentence of exile, instead <em>goes into exile</em> – into the far country of the grave – bearing the consequences of sin for the sake of humanity’s salvation.<a href="#_ftn22"><sup><sup>[22]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Matthias_Gr%C3%BCnewald_-_The_Crucifixion_-_WGA10723.jpg/696px-Matthias_Gr%C3%BCnewald_-_The_Crucifixion_-_WGA10723.jpg" alt="depiction of the crucifixion, the crisis point of Christian theology"  />
</p>
<p><strong>At the death of Christ, the Trinity has stretched to its limit, and yet humanity is left in a state of partial exile as before.</strong></p>
<p>However, through the power of the Holy Spirit, the exiled Son of God is vindicated as the Savior of the world and brought back from the far country of death!</p>
<p>(For more on the Resurrection, see my sermon: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/03/29/son-of-man-can-your-bones-live/">“Son Of Man, Can Your Bones Live?”</a>)</p>
<p>Through this movement of the Son into the utmost exile and back again, <strong>sin itself is offered up to destruction</strong>.<a href="#_ftn23"><sup><sup>[23]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>And crucially, <strong>all humanity who is united to him by grace through faith – everyone who is therefore <em>in Christ</em> – gets caught up with the Son in his return to the life and love of the Triune God.</strong><a href="#_ftn24"><sup><sup>[24]</sup></sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-church">THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>And yet, getting caught up with Christ in this return to Triune fellowship does <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>not</strong></em></span> take place <strong>timelessly</strong> or <strong>instantaneously</strong>.</p>
<p>It is, rather, an <em><strong>already, not-yet</strong></em> phenomenon. Between the Resurrection and the present moment lies the ongoing (for about two millennia, now) story of the Church.</p>
<p>And while all Christians confess some sort of belief in the future return of Jesus to set things right, to “judge the living and the dead” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed">Apostles’ Creed</a>), it is a particular (though not unique) strength of <strong>Anglicanism</strong> that it <strong>endeavors to take seriously both the timeliness and diversity of the Trinity’s external work throughout the Church’s history</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically, since the Holy Spirit has been faithful to sustain the Church and supply it with leaders and teachers throughout its existence as a community “in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments,” timely works of the Trinity, if you will, “be duly ministered” (<a href="https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx">Articles of Religion</a>, 19), Anglicans feel free to draw upon the <strong>diverse breadth of thought throughout the history of Christ’s Body</strong>.</p>
<p><em>[For example, I do not expect to be reprimanded for drawing heavily upon Barth, Moltmann, and Jenson (non-Anglicans, all) throughout this paper!</em><a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a>]</p>
<p>On one hand, Anglicans believe that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>[i]t is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly like</strong>; for at all times they have been divers[e], and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men’s manners, so that nothing be ordained against God’s Word” (Articles of Religion, 34).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Church history is not homogeneous, nor is it infallible.</strong></p>
<p>And yet, on the other hand, Anglicans are convinced that <strong>it is not <em>necessary</em> to jettison the great tradition(s) of the Church in order to achieve reform</strong>. Usually, one should only dispense with Church traditions that appear directly to contradict God’s Word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whosoever, through his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church…” (Articles of Religion, 34).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The history of the “one, holy, catholic, and apostolic” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed">Nicene Creed</a>) Church, despite its frequent descent into divided, profane, sectarian innovation, has <strong>great value</strong>.</p>
<p>Because it is a part of the history of the temporally-eternal, transcendently-immanent, Triune God – because it matters to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – <strong>the life and history of the Church ought to matter to all who call themselves Christians, Anglicans or not.</strong></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref13">[13]</a> “And for this reason, too, we have no need to project anything into eternity, for at this point eternity is time, i.e., the eternal name has become a temporal name, and the divine name a human. […] [I]n so far as these works are done in time, they rest upon the eternal decision of God by which time is founded and governed” (CD II/2, 98-9). See also Jenson, <em>Story and Promise</em> (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 1973), ch. 7.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref14">[14]</a> “The ontological determination of humanity is grounded in the fact that one man among all others is the man Jesus” (CD III/2, 132).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref15">[15]</a> Scripture itself seems to glimpse at the tension (but not the rift) between time and eternity in the midst of redemption. Christ, the “Lamb of God that was slaughtered from the foundation of the world” (Rev. 13:8), “was chosen before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for [humanity’s] sake” (1 Pet. 1:20), in order to overcome Sin and Death – God’s cosmic enemies which infected and affected every level of creation at the Fall (Gen. 3).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref16">[16]</a> Although, thankfully, the Old Testament is addressed in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion! Consider the beginning of Article VII (Of the Old Testament): “The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transitory promises.”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref17">[17]</a> See foundational covenant passages, such as Gen. 12, 15, throughout the Old Testament.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref18">[18]</a> Consider, for example, the curses for covenantal unfaithfulness found in Deut. 27:14-26; 28:15-68, culminating with the threat of exile.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref19">[19]</a> As Irenaeus and Athanasius proclaimed: “God became what we are so that we might become what He is.”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref20">[20]</a> In Barth’s words, “because our evil case otherwise meant our inevitable destruction, God willed to make it His own in Jesus Christ. What we are He Himself willed to become, in order to take and transform it from within, to make of it something new, the being of man reconciled with Himself” (CD IV/1, 242).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref21">[21]</a> According to Barth, “in the place of all men [Christ] has himself wrestled with that which separates them from him. He has himself borne the consequence of this separation to bear it away “(CD IV/1, 237-8).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref22">[22]</a> CD IV/1, 247.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref23">[23]</a> “In the suffering and death of Jesus Christ it has come to pass that in his own person he has made an end of us as sinners and therefore of sin itself by going to death as the One who took our place as sinners. In his person he has delivered up us sinners and sin itself to destruction” (CD IV/1, 253).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref24">[24]</a> Cf. 1 Cor 15:20-22. As the nexus of redemption and re-creation, the resurrection is crucial – for the focus of the atonement is not merely to sentence sin with its proper exile, but to fulfill God’s creative purposes for unity and participation in the divine life.</p>

<h1 id="i-introduction-the-prodigal-son-part-2">I. Introduction: The Prodigal Son, Part 2</h1>
<p>What a relief, to get out of that house.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey!</p>
<p>But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that <em>prodigal</em>) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.</p>
<p>So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.</p>
<p>But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.</p>
<p>“Dad has <em><u>changed</u></em>. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the <u>only</u> son. Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally <u>proud</u> of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.</p>
<p>And then Ethan threw it all away.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what, as it that weren’t bad enough, <u>dad</u> threw it all away…<u>for</u> Ethan.</p>
<p>He received much more love than I ever did.</p>
<p>I used to get punished for much slighter infractions than throwing my entire life (along with our hard-earned savings) away!</p>
<p>I never got a <em>banquet</em> when I broke Sabbath…I got a <em>beating</em>!”</p>
<p>At this point, Jude’s unpleasant thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the homestead on the horizon.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the amount of trash bags on the front porch.</p>
<p>Not much later, the smell hit him. Odors he’d only ever experienced in faraway marketplaces, and therefore that much more memorable.</p>
<p>Barely believing his eyes and his nose, Jude took a closer look at the trash.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grilled pork chop remnants.</li>
<li>Crusty booze bottles.</li>
<li>Bacon pizza fragments.</li>
<li>Ashen cigarette butts.</li>
<li>The slimy shells of shellfish.</li>
</ul>
<p>His blood pressure rising, Jude spit on the refuse-pile and stormed in the front door.</p>
<p>“Dad! Where are you!? He’s done it again! Brought his dirty Gentile friends into our home! Dad?!”</p>
<p>A very obviously hungover Ethan stumbled into the main room, nibbling on a piece of bacon. “Jude! You’re back…”</p>
<p>And Jude <strong><u>broke</u></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Ethan! You <em>ethnoi</em>, you <u>Gentiles</u>!</p>
<p>How can you continually scorn <u>our</u> father’s, <u>the</u> Father’s, <strong><u>righteousness</u></strong>!?</p>
<p>First, you go and throw away your life and our life-savings to <strong>run away with swine</strong>?!</p>
<p>Then, after the Father <em><strong>somehow</strong></em> took you in – adopted you like some bastard, orphaned children – <em><strong>you bring the swine back into this house?!</strong></em></p>
<p>You think you’re so <u>strong</u>, so <u>powerful</u>, but you’re <strong>weak</strong>!</p>
<p>You think you know <u>who the Father is</u>, <u>what he’s like</u>, but you’re <strong>wrong</strong>!</p>
<p>We’re <u>strong</u>! We’re the <u>firstborn sons</u> of God!</p>
<p><em><strong>Who in the hell do you Gentiles think you are?!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>If you really loved God, you would <u>follow</u> the Law and <u>keep</u> the traditions…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>How can the Father love you? It’s embarrassing, really.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We never should have allowed you back into this <u>house</u></strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now, Ethan was boiling over as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“Damn you, Jude! You Judaioi, you Jews!</strong></em></p>
<p>How can you continually forget <u>our</u> father, <u>the</u> Father’s <strong><u>grace</u></strong>?!</p>
<p>Don’t you realize by now that all your stupid <u>rituals</u>, all your hard <u>lessons</u> learned, were <strong><u>a complete waste of time</u></strong>!?</p>
<p>We Gentiles and God have moved on into the <strong><u>age of grace</u></strong>!</p>
<p>You Jews have FORGOTTEN the point of God’s grace, and so <u>He’s practically forgotten you</u>!</p>
<p>We’re the <u>firstborn</u>, <u>best-loved</u> sons now.</p>
<p>We’re the <u>strong</u> ones, and we <u>outnumber</u> you all at least three to one, so <strong>shut up and deal with it</strong>!</p>
<p>You’ve SCREWED UP so often, you got KICKED OUT of your land!</p>
<p>And you didn’t learn any lessons then, because you got yourselves THROWN OUT of Rome!</p>
<p><em><strong>How could Nero have let you back into this city? It’s shameful, really.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We never should have allowed you back into this Church, you…”</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]</p>
<p>Someone at the door.</p>
<p>The Roman Christians – Jew and Gentile alike – froze in fear.</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong> looked at the other <strong>Gentile leaders.</strong></p>
<p>Was it a centurion? Had their gathering been reported? Would they be asked to bow the knee, to offer a sacrifice, to the new emperor, Nero? If they weren’t willing to do so, would this be the end?</p>
<p><strong>Jude</strong> glanced at his wife, their children, and the other <strong>Jewish families.</strong></p>
<p>Had they already outstayed their recent welcome back to the city? After exile, they’d spent four hard, hard years rebuilding their life in Rome. Would they again be driven from their homes? Where would they go?</p>
<p>The <strong>slaves</strong> in the room – and there were <u>many</u> – anxiously retraced their steps throughout the day.</p>
<p>Which one of their fellow slaves had discovered their secret? Had followed them to this meeting? Had told their master? Would they merely get whipped again? Or had their master’s patience run out?</p>
<p>Jude whispered to Ethan, “You’re in charge here, get the door.”</p>
<p>He trudged to the threshold and pulled it open.</p>
<p>A hooded figure stepped through, walked to the middle of the room, and pulled the hood back.</p>
<p>Long brown hair flowed down.</p>
<p>The woman said <strong>“Christ is Risen!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“…He is…risen…indeed,”</strong> they all stammered in reply.</p>
<p>She smiled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“He is risen indeed. For twenty-five years now, in fact!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greetings. My name is Phoebe of Cenchreae.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rummaging in her pack, she began to explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I bring something for all of you from Paul, the apostle…</strong></p>
<p><strong>It’s in here, somewhere. Not this theology textbook. Not this to-do list…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ah! Here it is, a <u>letter</u>.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After carefully opening the document, she began to read the following words.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, her first audience didn’t have the benefit of reading these words off a page, but that’s no excuse for you not to follow along in your Bible, if you’ve got it with you.</p>
<p>Open up to Romans 1, and as I read these words, imagine Phoebe reading them for the first time to a room full of Roman Christians.</p>
<p>Reading these words like she was convinced they were absolutely true.</p>
<p>She began:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ our Lord,<sup> </sup>through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles, among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called as saints:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God’s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you — that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.</strong></p>
<p><strong><sup> </sup>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, although that concludes the chunk of Romans we’ll consider today, Phoebe went on to read the rest of the <u>7,114 Greek words</u> in the letter.</p>
<p>And, as far as we know, as the one to deliver this letter, she would have also been its first <u>interpreter</u>. That is, she would have answered the <u>questions</u> of the first audience regarding what had been read.</p>
<p>Now, despite Paul’s wide influence in the early Church, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that at least one woefully-uninformed Christian at Rome would have raised his hand and asked: <strong>“Who is Paul?”</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>I mean, Who <u>was</u> Paul, really?</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="ii-from-paul">II. From Paul</h1>
<p>Well, as sister Phoebe mentioned, about <u>twenty-five years</u> separated the <u>Resurrection</u> of our Lord Jesus Christ and <u>Paul’s penning</u> of the letter to the Christians at Rome in 57, 58 AD.</p>
<p>If you wanted to find <strong>Paul</strong> in the <u>same year</u> that Jesus of Nazareth walked out of his grave, you might be a bit frustrated as you repeatedly flip through the “P” section of your Palestinian Phonebook. Because, see, <em><strong><u>Saul</u></strong></em>, of Tarsus, is your guy.</p>
<p>And, like some others whose names have changed, Paul had a <strong><u>past</u></strong>.</p>
<p>He’d <strong><u>done some things</u></strong>.</p>
<p>And I’m not going to spoil this with some alliterated list. I’ll let Paul tell you about his past:</p>
<p>In Acts 22:3-4, he says, if you’ll indulge the paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I’m a Jew. Sure, I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up right here in Jerusalem, educated in Dr. Gamaliel’s strict, strict seminary to learn and live the Law of Moses. I was just as zealous for God as any Jew. How zealous? I persecuted this Way, these Christians, to the death! I’d throw any of them I could, men or women, into prison!”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Acts 26:5b, 9-11, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I wasn’t just any zealous Jew, either. I was a Pharisee! […] I hated and opposed the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Jerusalem was my first Christian-hunting ground! I asked my superiors for permission, then threw those Christians in jail! And when it was time for their death-row judgment, I always cast a kill-vote. Just for fun, sometimes, I’d try to trip them up in synagogue – ask them just the right theological questions to get them to show their heretical cards. But deep down, I hated them. When they fled Jerusalem, I pursued them.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Galatians 1:13-14, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:10px;line-height:10px;">“</span>You know what I did in my Jewish-only days, how I tried to wipe the church of God from the face of the earth. I was climbing the rungs of Judaism faster than anyone else my age. I was more zealous for the traditions than any of my old seminary buddies.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Philippians 3:5-6, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I was circumcised, I was as Hebrew as Hebrew could be; as to the law, a righteous Pharisee – no one followed it better!; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church;”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:13, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I once was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Jew.</li>
<li>A Pharisee.</li>
<li>A blasphemer.</li>
<li>A persecutor.</li>
<li>An insolent opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Such was Saul of Tarsus.</strong></em></p>
<p>And YET, here, Paul, to the Christians at Rome, declares himself, <u>first</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2 id="a-slave"><em><strong>A SLAVE.</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as previously, to his own <u>zeal for the traditions</u> and the so-called “righteousness” of the Law of Moses.</p>
<p>But a SLAVE of CHRIST JESUS. Taking orders from the one whose name he had <u>previously</u> and <u>viciously</u> endeavored to <u>oppose</u>!</p>
<p>Paul declares himself, second:</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2 id="called"><em><strong>CALLED</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as he had previously supposed, to <u>persecute the Church</u>.</p>
<p>But to <u>plant churches</u>! To serve the church as an APOSTLE, as an ambassador, as an envoy – with a message from his master, Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>A slave. Called an apostle. Paul declares himself, third:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2 id="set-apart"><em><strong>SET APART</strong></em></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOT, as previously, for the sake of the Law as a Pharisee, which literally meant “one set apart.”</p>
<p>But set apart for the sake of the GOSPEL! The good news regarding his master!</p>
<p>Paul wants to <u>serve</u> the Church at Rome by <strong>preaching the gospel</strong> there, in order to <u>strengthen them spiritually</u>. This <u>letter</u> to the Romans will preach the gospel <u>in his stead</u> until he can do so <strong>face to face.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No longer a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But now a slave, an apostle, set apart for the gospel…Such was Paul!</strong></p>
<p>**Quite the transition! Don’t you think?**</p>
<p>It almost make us wonder:</p>
<p>“<strong>What could be <u>powerful</u> enough to <u>transform</u> someone like this?</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>What could be <u>powerful</u> enough to <u>transform</u> someone like this?</strong>”</p>
<p><u>But</u>…c’mon, we’re not studying Paul himself. We’re taking a look at <strong><u>Romans</u></strong>, remember? And, while no one would have asked sister Phoebe this question back then, we need to ask it today:</p>
<p><em><strong>**Who <u>were</u> the Romans? Who <u>were</u> these Christians at Rome?**</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="iii-to-the-roman-christians"><strong>III. To the Roman Christians</strong></h1>
<p>Well, like everyone, name-change or not, they had a <u>past</u>.</p>
<p>At <u>one</u> time – the Jews and the Gentiles alike – were both <strong><u>faithless</u></strong>. They were more or less <u>groping</u> along in the darkness until they came to know Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<p><u>Now, we don’t know much</u> about how Christianity first spread westward from Jerusalem to the center of the Roman Empire. However, it was <u>probably</u> taken there by Jewish Christians – perhaps by the Jewish “visitors from Rome” who, according to Acts 2:10, were present at Pentecost.</p>
<p>Regardless, those Christians present in Rome when Phoebe arrived were, in general, <strong>no longer <u>completely</u> faithless.</strong> After all, Jesus the Messiah had <u>enough</u> of a claim on their lives for them to risk attending <u>a potentially unpopular meeting</u>.</p>
<p>And yet, much like Saul had been <strong>ashamed</strong> of the <u>Jews</u> who had chosen to follow a <u>crucified Messiah</u> (…not to mention how much that Pharisee would have been ashamed of Gentile sinners!)…</p>
<p>Now, not just <u>annoyed</u>, or <u>irritated</u>. But ashamed. Embarrassed. Disgusted by the very existence of something, because it is humiliating.</p>
<p><u>Come on and feel</u> this for a second. We know what it’s like, <strong>to look in the mirror, to look back into our past, and feel gut-wrenching shame – at our high-handed sins, our careless words, our lies and our lusts. Because we’ve DONE some things. We have a PAST.</strong></p>
<p><em>**Shameful, really.**</em></p>
<p>Well…Much like the previous Paul, the Christians at Rome were <strong><u>ashamed</u></strong>.</p>
<p><u>First</u>, they were at least <u>tempted</u> to be ashamed of a <u>Savior</u> who didn’t exactly live up to the Roman ideals of <strong>power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>. This was real, this was raw. It may have been a bit <u>embarrassing</u> sometimes, to walk by the <u>huge buildings</u> and <u>striking soldiers</u> of the Empire to go and worship in secret a guy who had been</p>
<ul>
<li>mocked,</li>
<li>beaten,</li>
<li>stripped naked,</li>
<li>and nailed to a tree</li>
<li>until he died like a common criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ashamed, of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Second, they were ashamed of <strong><u>each other</u>.</strong></p>
<p>I hope my, admittedly apocryphal introduction gave you at least a <u>taste</u> of what it <u>could</u> have been like to be a Christian at Rome. Based on <u>historical evidence</u> and what Paul has to say at the <u>end</u> of this letter, we can surmise that the Roman church <u>shifted</u> from <u>predominantly <strong>Jewish</strong></u> to predominantly <strong>Gentile</strong>.</p>
<p><u>Positively</u>, this could have happened through <strong>new Gentile converts</strong>. <u>Negatively</u>, Emperor <strong>Claudius</strong> expelled the Jews from the city of Rome in <strong>AD 49</strong> due to a Jewish dispute about Christ. <strong>Acts 18:2</strong> mentions <strong>Priscilla</strong> and <strong>Aquila</strong> as two of the Jews thus exiled. With <u>most</u> of the Jews forced to leave the city, the churches would have become <strong>predominantly Gentile</strong>.</p>
<p>However, after Claudius’ death in <strong>AD 54</strong>, the Jews began to return to Rome under the new emperor, <strong>Nero</strong>. …To return to churches now <u>led by</u> and <u>populated with</u> <strong>Gentiles</strong> – Gentiles who no longer followed certain restrictions in the Mosaic Law.</p>
<p><strong>Jewish</strong> Christians were ashamed of their libertine <strong>Gentile</strong> brothers and sisters in Christ. How could these people so quickly forget the Jewish origins of their faith?</p>
<p><strong>Gentile</strong> Christians were ashamed of their <strong>Jewish</strong> brothers and sisters in Christ, because they were <em><strong>personae non gratae</strong></em> – <strong>unwelcome persons – to many Romans.</strong> They only <u>increased</u> the risk that the next knock on the door would be an unhappy centurion.</p>
<p><strong>Ashamed</strong> and <strong>divided</strong>. Such were <u>the Christians at Rome</u>.</p>
<p>And yet Paul writes to them, to <strong><u>call</u></strong> them – as <u>Christ</u> had called them – to something <em><strong><u>better</u></strong></em>. What was it?</p>
<p>The <strong><u>“obedience of faith”</u></strong> – and here <u>Paul’s</u> transformation links up with <u>theirs</u>.</p>
<p>Look at what he says in verse 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>through Christ <strong>“we have received grace and apostleship</strong> (Paul’s transformation) <strong>to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles</strong> (the Roman Christians’ transformation)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what does this <em><strong>obedience of faith</strong></em>, this <strong><u>obedient faithfulness</u></strong>, if you will, <strong>look like</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest with you, Paul doesn’t have <u>much</u> to say about this in these introductory paragraphs. <strong>He’s starting his audience off on a long trajectory</strong>, but he does <strong>return</strong> to the obedience of faith at the end of this letter! The exact phrase appears in the letter’s last sentence, in fact.</p>
<p>But the idea of obedient faithfulness appears a bit earlier.</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapters 1-3,</u></strong> we see what the <strong>opposite</strong> of obedient faithfulness looks like. At the end of chapter 3, we see what <strong>God’s saving faithfulness</strong> looks like (…It looks like Jesus!)</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapter 4</u></strong>, we see that obedient faithfulness still looked pretty similar in the Old Testament – with father <em><strong><u>Abraham</u></strong></em>, of whom it’s said in verses 20-21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in faith as he gave glory to God, (even before he was circumcised, mind you), fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>In chapters 5-8</u></strong>, we see various facets of God’s saving faithfulness as the foundation of our obedient faithfulness.</p>
<p><strong><u>In chapters 9-11</u></strong>, we are reminded that there is HOPE for obedient faithfulness among the Jewish people, because God remains utterly faithful to his promises.</p>
<p>And, I suggest to you that Paul refers to this <em><strong>obedient faithfulness</strong></em> in the well-known beginning of chapter 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your <u>spiritual worship</u>,”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or your “<em><strong>rational service</strong></em>,” or your “<em><strong>obedient faithfulness</strong></em>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <strong>the rest of</strong> <strong><u>chapter 12</u></strong>, we find out that obedient faithfulness looks like <strong><u>humility</u></strong> (12:3-8) and love (12:9-21).</p>
<p>In <strong><u>chapter 13</u></strong>, we find out what <strong><u>humility</u></strong> and <strong><u>love</u></strong> look like when translated from another person to an impersonal government.</p>
<p>And then <strong><u>in chapters 14 and 15</u></strong> we get to the pastoral heart of Paul’s letter. The <strong>Christians at Rome were letting holy days and food laws come between them</strong>.</p>
<p>I find two verses of rebuke especially poignant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Romans 14:15 – <strong>“For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.”</strong></li>
<li>Romans 14:20 – <strong>“Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what I’m getting at: Paul calls the <u>ashamed</u> and <u>divided</u> Christians at Rome to the <strong><u>obedient faithfulness of UNITY</u></strong>.</p>
<p>Consider 15:5-7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,<sup> </sup>that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it: this is a far cry from Jude and Ethan’s passionate argument at the beginning! Again, we must ask:</p>
<p><em><strong>What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?</strong></em></p>
<p>The same thing that was powerful enough to change Saul to Paul: <em><strong><u>the gospel.</u></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><u>What is the gospel?</u></strong></em></p>
<h1 id="iv-through-the-gospel">IV. Through the Gospel</h1>
<p>Well, much like God’s people, including Paul and the Roman Christians, God’s gospel <strong><u>has a past</u></strong>.</p>
<p>See, it was once a <u>partial promise to the people of Israel</u>. Writing to his divided and divisive audience of Jew and Gentile Christians, Paul begins with the gospel’s Jewish roots:</p>
<p>Look at verses 2-3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God had promised the gospel <strong>“beforehand through his prophets in the holy [Hebrew] Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Jewish mission.</li>
<li>A Jewish hope.</li>
<li>A Son of David, in <u>human flesh.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>But how is this <u>powerful</u> enough to <strong>transform</strong>?</p>
<p>How does this <u>Jewish</u> mission have a claim on the faithful obedience of the <strong>Gentiles</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>**Because the Son of <u>David</u> is the Son of <u>God</u>.**</strong></p>
<p>The one <u>born</u>, and <u>crucified</u>, in the <u>weakness</u> of human flesh, is <strong>RAISED</strong> by the Holy Spirit in the <strong>power</strong> of <strong>resurrection</strong>! And this powerfully risen Messiah is the <strong><u>LORD</u></strong>. The <strong><u>Lord</u></strong> over more than Emperor Nero’s puny Roman playground. He is the Lord of heaven and earth! Of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p>You know, <u>merely</u> <u>crucified</u> Messiah is a <em><strong>poor</strong></em> Messiah indeed – worthy of <em><strong><u>shame</u></strong></em>. But a RISEN Messiah is a TRUE Messiah – worthy of <em><strong><u>obedience</u></strong></em> and <em><strong><u>faithfulness</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>Paul is therefore not ashamed of the gospel, because he recognizes its resurrection <strong>power</strong> – a power to <u>save</u> and <u>transform</u> <strong>ALL</strong> those who believe – both Jews and Gentiles who <u>trust</u> that <strong>Jesus Christ is who he says he is – the Son of God!</strong>,</p>
<p>Who <u>trust</u> that <strong>he has done what he set out to do –</strong> <strong>to <u>save</u> and to <u>redeem</u> through his life, death, resurrection and ascension.</strong></p>
<p>The gospel is therefore powerful enough to <u>save</u> and <u>transform</u> all those who <strong><u>trust</u></strong> that <strong>God is who he says he is</strong> – which is to say all those who <strong><u>believe</u></strong> that God himself is <strong><u>righteous</u></strong>.</p>
<p>He is <strong><u>faithful to keep his promises</u></strong> – his <strong><u>covenants</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to Adam,</li>
<li>to Noah,</li>
<li>to Abraham,</li>
<li>to Moses,</li>
<li>to David,</li>
<li>to Jeremiah,</li>
<li>and to all of creation –</li>
</ul>
<p>his <em><strong><u>promises</u></strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>to put the world back together again,</li>
<li>to not let Sin and Death have the final word,</li>
<li>but to <u>raise</u> his people from their graves,</li>
<li>to <u>melt</u> their hearts of stone,</li>
<li>to <u>breathe</u> breath, his <u>Spirit</u>, into their dry bones and lifeless flesh,</li>
<li>to bring the dead back to <u>life</u>,</li>
<li>to bring <u>US</u> back to life, read Romans 8!</li>
<li>to make the <u>faithless</u> ones <strong>faithful</strong>, to make <u>US</u> <strong>faithful</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>**God’s saving faithfulness to all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – through Jesus the Messiah calls forth, by the Holy Spirit, obedient faithfulness from all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – <u>to</u> Jesus the Messiah.**</strong></span></p>
<p>His <u>saving</u> faithfulness <strong>demands</strong> <u>obedient</u> faithfulness, and his Holy Spirit <strong>enables</strong> it.</p>
<p>God’s saving faithfulness <strong>demands</strong> and the Holy Spirit <strong>enables</strong> obedient faithfulness:</p>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as Paul says in 5:21,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as in 8:38,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“neither <u>death</u>, nor <u>life</u>, nor <u>angels</u>, nor <u>heavenly rulers</u>, nor things that are <u>present</u>, nor things to <u>come</u>, nor <u>powers</u>, nor <u>height</u>, nor <u>depth</u>, nor <u>anything</u> else in creation will be able to <u>separate</u> us from the <u>love</u> of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>So that</u></strong>, as in 15:5-6,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“the God of endurance and comfort [may] give you <u>unity</u> with one another in accordance with Christ Jesus, so that <u>together</u> you may with <u>one voice</u> glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<li>to transform Saul into Paul,</li>
<li>to unite Jews and Gentiles, to transcend their divisions!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>***BUT: Do we have faith that the gospel is powerful enough to transcend OUR divisions?**</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>…Is the gospel powerful enough to transcend our differences?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>…Is the gospel powerful enough:</strong></em></p>
<p>To unite liturgy-loving Anglicans with Bible-thumping Baptists?</p>
<p>To bring together, in LOVE:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contemporary and the traditional,</li>
<li>The “smells and bells” with the seeker-sensitive,</li>
<li>The 1928 Prayer Books with the 1979 Prayer Books,</li>
<li>with the “What’s a Prayer Book?”s</li>
<li>The Lutherans and the Reformed</li>
<li>The Democrats and the Republicans</li>
<li>The Calvinists and the Arminians</li>
<li>The Blacks and the Whites</li>
<li>The Piperites and the N.T. Wrightians</li>
<li>The Latinos and the Asians</li>
<li>The egalitarians and complementarians</li>
<li>The rich and the poor</li>
<li>The paedobaptists and the credobaptists?</li>
</ul>
<p>…the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>“Do not destroy someone for whom Christ died.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of _______,</strong></p>
<p><strong>be it your prayer-book preferences or your theological idiosyncrasies.”</strong></p>
<p>See, Paul <strong><u>could</u></strong> have attempted to <u>unify</u> the Roman Christians by <strong>turning their faith in on itself</strong>. By encouraging them to <u>admire</u>, as if in a mirror, the <em><strong>surprising fact that their diverse church existed in the center of a pagan empire!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><u>But he did NOT do that! </u></strong></em></p>
<p>Instead, he maintained that the <u>gospel</u> reveals God’s righteousness <em><strong><u>“from faith to faith”</u></strong></em> –</p>
<p><strong>FROM</strong> the Faithful God <strong>TO</strong> his <em>previously</em> <strong>faithless</strong>, but <em>potentially</em> <strong>faithful</strong> and <strong>unified</strong>, people! <strong>FROM GOD TO US</strong></p>
<p>That <strong><u>order</u></strong> is important! <u>Because it will not do</u> to engage in <em><strong>ecclesiastical navel-gazing!</strong></em> We can’t just look at <u>ourselves</u> and marvel at the fact that <em><strong>our diverse seminary exists in the center of a pagan empire!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><u>No! We must look to Christ!</u></strong> For he himself is our <strong><u>peace</u></strong>, first with <u>God</u> and then with <u>one</u> <u>another</u>!</p>
<p>If we look at <u>one another</u>, before looking at <u>Christ</u>, and try to transcend our differences <u>on our own</u>, then <em><strong>we will inevitably become <u>ashamed</u> of one another</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em>Ashamed.</em></p>
<p><em>I can’t believe that God let some of y’all into his Church!</em></p>
<p>I’m embarrassed and frustrated by some of you. Sure, on my better days, I’ll admit you’re my brothers and sisters. But most days, we don’t feel much like siblings. Or maybe, we feel a bit TOO MUCH like human siblings, <u>bickering</u> and <u>nagging</u> and <u>fighting</u>.</p>
<p>And sure, I know I embarrass and frustrate some of you. And if that doesn’t apply to you <u>yet</u>, just <strong><u>wait</u></strong>! I’ll get there.</p>
<p>Friends, Sisters, Brothers, If we are <u>on our own</u> in this crazy thing called <strong>Church</strong>, it’s a hopeless, frustrating <em><strong><u>mess</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>But <u>if we trust that Paul knew what he was doing</u> when he began with the <strong>GOSPEL</strong> in this <u>lengthy pastoral letter to a <strong>divided</strong> church</u>,</p>
<p>If <u>we look to Christ Jesus</u> and <strong>trust</strong> that the gospel is <strong><u>powerful</u></strong> enough, not just to save, transform, and unify <em><strong>them</strong></em>, back <em><strong>then</strong></em>… but <strong>US, RIGHT NOW…</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>If we look to Christ and trust: </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Then,</u></strong> TOGETHER we <strong>“may with <u>one</u> voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Then,</u></strong> TOGETHER we may <strong>“<u>receive</u> one another, just as Christ also received [us], to God’s glory.”</strong></p>
<p>Then, TOGETHER we may <u>sing</u> and <u>believe</u> the words of the following hymn:</p>
<p>You’ve got a handout with the words. Would you stand and sing it with me?</p>
<p><strong>The Church’s one foundation<br>
Is Jesus Christ her Lord,<br>
She is His new creation<br>
By water and the Word.<br>
From heaven He came and sought her<br>
To be His holy bride;<br>
With His own blood He bought her<br>
And for her life He died.</strong></p>
<p><strong>She is from every nation,<br>
Yet one o’er all the earth;<br>
Her charter of salvation,<br>
One Lord, one faith, one birth;<br>
One holy Name she blesses,<br>
Partakes one holy food,<br>
And to one hope she presses,<br>
With every grace endued.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Though with a scornful wonder<br>
Men see her sore oppressed,<br>
By schisms rent asunder,<br>
By heresies distressed:<br>
Yet saints their watch are keeping,<br>
Their cry goes up, “How long?”<br>
And soon the night of weeping<br>
Shall be the morn of song!</strong></p>
<p><strong>’Mid toil and tribulation,<br>
And tumult of her war,<br>
She waits the consummation<br>
Of peace forevermore;<br>
Till, with the vision glorious,<br>
Her longing eyes are blest,<br>
And the great Church victorious<br>
Shall be the Church at rest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;relief&lt;/span&gt;, to get out of that house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey! But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand. But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">relief</span>, to get out of that house.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey! But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.</p>
<p>So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand. But now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.</p>
<p>“Dad has <em><strong>changed</strong></em>. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span> son.</p>
<p>Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally <span style="text-decoration:underline;">proud</span> of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.</p>
<p>And then Ethan threw it all away.</p>
<p>Actually, you know what, as it that weren’t bad enough, dad threw it all away…<span style="text-decoration:underline;">for</span> Ethan!</p>
<p>He received <span style="text-decoration:underline;">much</span> more love than I ever did. I used to get punished for much slighter infractions than throwing my entire life (along with our hard-earned savings) away! I never got a <em>banquet</em> when I broke Sabbath…I got a <em>beating</em>!”</p>
<p>At this point, Jude’s unpleasant thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the homestead on the horizon.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed was the amount of trash bags on the front porch. Not much later, the smell hit him. Odors he’d only ever experienced in faraway marketplaces, and therefore that much more memorable.</p>
<p>Barely believing his eyes and his nose, Jude took a closer look at the trash.</p>
<p>Grilled pork chop remnants.</p>
<p>Crusty booze bottles.</p>
<p>Bacon pizza fragments.</p>
<p>Ashen cigarette butts.</p>
<p>The slimy shells of shellfish.</p>
<p>His blood pressure rising, Jude spit on the refuse-pile and stormed in the front door.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Dad! Where are you!? He’s done it again! Brought his dirty Gentile friends into our home! Dad?!”</strong></em></p>
<p>A very obviously hungover Ethan stumbled into the main room, nibbling on a piece of bacon. <em><strong>“Jude! You’re back…”</strong></em></p>
<p>And Jude <span style="text-decoration:underline;">broke</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Ethan! You <em>ethnoi</em>, you Gentiles! How can you continually scorn our father’s, the Father’s, righteousness!?</p>
<p>First, you go and throw away your life and our life-savings to run away with swine?! Then, after the Father somehow took you in – adopted you like some bastard, orphaned children – you bring the swine back into this house?!</p>
<p>You think you’re so strong, so powerful, but you’re <strong>weak</strong>! You think you know who the Father is, what he’s like, but you’re <strong>wrong</strong>!</p>
<p>We’re strong! We’re the firstborn sons of God! Who in the hell do you Gentiles think you are?!</p>
<p>If you really loved God, you would follow the Law and keep the traditions…</p>
<p>How can the Father love you people? It’s embarrassing, really.</p>
<p>We never should have allowed you back into this house.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now, Ethan was boiling over as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Damn you, Jude! You <em>judaioi</em>, you Jews!</p>
<p>How can you continually forget our father, the Father’s grace?!</p>
<p>Don’t you realize by now that all your stupid rituals, all your hard lessons learned, were a complete waste of time!? We Gentiles and God have moved on into the age of grace!</p>
<p>You Jews have forgotten the point of God’s grace, and so He’s practically forgotten you! We’re the firstborn, best-loved sons now. We’re the strong ones, and we outnumber you all at least three to one, so shut up and deal with it!</p>
<p>You’ve screwed up so often, you got kicked out of your land! And you didn’t learn any lessons then, because you got yourselves thrown out of Rome!</p>
<p>How could Nero have let you people back into this city? It’s shameful, really.</p>
<p>We never should have allowed you back into this Church, you…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]</p>
<p>Someone at the door.</p>
<p>The Roman Christians – Jew and Gentile alike – froze in fear.</p>
<p>Ethan looked at the other Gentile leaders.</p>
<p>Was it a centurion? Had their gathering been reported? Would they be asked to bow the knee, to offer a sacrifice, to the new emperor, Nero? If they weren’t willing to do so, would this be the end?</p>
<p>Jude glanced at his wife, their children, and the other Jewish families.</p>
<p>Had they already outstayed their recent welcome back to the city? After exile, they’d spent four hard, hard years rebuilding their life in Rome. Would they again be driven from their homes? Where would they go?</p>
<p>The slaves in the room – and there were many – anxiously retraced their steps throughout the day.</p>
<p>Which one of their fellow slaves had discovered their secret? Had followed them to this meeting? Had told their master? Would they merely get whipped again? Or had their master’s patience run out?</p>
<p>Jude whispered to Ethan, “You’re in charge here, get the door.”</p>
<p>He trudged to the threshold and pulled it open.</p>
<p>A hooded figure stepped through, walked to the middle of the room, and pulled the hood back. Long brown hair flowed down.</p>
<p>The woman said “Christ is Risen!”</p>
<p>“…He is…risen…indeed,” they all stammered in reply.</p>
<p>She smiled: “He is risen indeed. For twenty-five years now, in fact! Greetings. My name is Phoebe of Cenchreae.”</p>
<p>Rummaging in her pack, she began to explain:</p>
<p>“I bring something for all of you from Paul, the apostle… It’s in here, somewhere. No, not this theology textbook. No, not this to-do list… Ah! Here it is, a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>letter</strong></span>.”</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A homily on Mark 8:11-21 (ESV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-11&#34;&gt;The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-12&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24508&#34;&gt;And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, &lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;“Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-13&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24509&#34;&gt;And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-14&#34;&gt;Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-15&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24511&#34;&gt;And he cautioned them, saying, &lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;“Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-16&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24512&#34;&gt;And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-17&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24513&#34;&gt;And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, &lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;“Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-18&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24514&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-19&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24515&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?”&lt;/span&gt; They said to him, “Twelve.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-20&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24516&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;“And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?”&lt;/span&gt; And they said to him, “Seven.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Mark-8-21&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-24517&#34;&gt;And he said to them, &lt;span class=&#34;woj&#34;&gt;“Do you not yet understand?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1974feb23-00025">In an interview, published in 1974</a>, with famed thinker Bertrand Russell, Leo Rosten asked Russell the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let us suppose, sir, that after you have left this sorry vale, you actually found yourself in heaven, standing before the Throne. There, in all his glory, sat the Lord—not Lord Russell, sir: God.”</p>
<p>Russell winced.</p>
<p>“What would you think?”</p>
<p>“I would think I was dreaming.”</p>
<p>“But suppose you realized you were not? Suppose that there, before your very eyes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, was God. What would you say?”</p>
<p>The pixie wrinkled his nose. “I probably would ask, ‘Sir, why did you not give me better evidence?’ “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Numbers 14:11, YHWH says to Moses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we return to consider our passage from Mark 8, keep in mind that in the region of Tyre, Jesus has just performed a long-distance exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman’s daughter (7:24-30). He has just healed a deaf mute in the region of the Decapolis (7:31-37). He has just fed at least four thousand people with just seven loaves of bread in a desolate place (8:1-10).</p>
<p>And yet, in the region of Dalmanutha, the Pharisees have the audacity to <em><strong>demand a sign</strong></em> from heaven, to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>test</strong></span> Jesus in a manner not unlike the Adversary tested him in the wilderness (Mark 1:13).</p>
<p>Why does this demand <span style="text-decoration:underline;">exasperate</span> Jesus? Surely, given his recent actions, he is not averse to the supernatural in-breaking of God’s kingdom as demonstrated in his miracles. Instead, he astutely recognizes <strong>the incompatibility of this sign-seeking pharisaical power-play with true trust, true faith.</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.catholiccommentaryonsacredscripture.com/volumes-authors/mary-healy/">Catholic scholar Mary Healy </a>rightfully observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“to insist on irrefutable evidence is really a demand for control, as if to say ‘Force us to believe, so that we will not have to trust you or change our hearts.’ But faith that is compelled is not faith at all” (<em>The Gospel of Mark</em>, 153).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am here reminded of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the twin-error of fundamentalism and liberalism</span> when it comes to biblical and theological studies: the insistence that <strong>we will only believe what is scientifically verifiable according to the standards we have inherited from Enlightenment Rationalism</strong>. The former group thinks <span style="text-decoration:underline;">everything</span> can be verified, the latter group, very <span style="text-decoration:underline;">little</span>.</p>
<p>Sure, OK, but <u>we’re</u> not fundamentalists or liberals, at least not on our <em>good</em> days. But, following the example of the disciples in the second half of our passage, <em>don’t we often pine for various other kinds of bread while we misunderstand and ignore the true bread of heaven among us</em>?</p>
<p>Will we be satisfied by God’s faithful provision of Word and Sacrament to nourish our faith? Or will we long for the more extraordinary manifestations? (As if Word &amp; Sacrament were ordinary!)</p>
<p>Now, can we, should we long for miracles, for healing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can God, will God continue to work wonders, heal sickness, and reverse death in our midst?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But we must be constantly <em><strong>vigilant</strong></em>, first, that we do not begin to value the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">healing</span> more than the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Healer</span>, the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">wonders</span> more than the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">One who works them</span>.</p>
<p>And, second, that we do not, like the Pharisees (and even the disciples, for a time!), close our eyes, ears, and hearts to the miraculous things that God, in Christ, is <em><strong>already</strong></em> and <em><strong>always</strong></em> doing.</p>
<p>Whether we can discern it or not, <strong>God is making the world right again. He will not be thwarted in this mission</strong>.</p>
<p>Friends, God knows that we need some sort of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sign</span>, that we cannot keep the faith on our own, unaided. So he has given us sign-seekers His very <span style="text-decoration:underline;">self</span>, His very <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Son</span>!</p>
<p>He will not bow down to our demands for <em>verification</em>, but he will graciously meet our every need. He will give us enough to trust him along the road to cosmic redemption, even when that road passes through the deepest, darkest valley of doubt.</p>
<p>So, as we rightfully pray that God’s Kingdom would come, that His will might be done, let us pray to be satisfied in our King, in God’s Son.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Today’s Gospel lesson consists of at least three distinct episodes.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Mark 1:29-34, Jesus heals Peter’s mother-in-law before a night-long, town-wide round of healings and exorcisms.</li>
<li>Then, in Mark 1:35-39, Jesus absconds to a desolate place in the early morning hours to pray. When Peter and the others find him, he reaffirms the preaching focus of his ministry, before taking the disciples along with him as he proclaims the kingdom in Galilee, and demonstrates the kingdom by casting out demons.</li>
<li>Finally, in Mark 1:40-45, a leper courageously and somewhat scandalously approaches Jesus, asking to be made clean. Jesus, moved with compassion, grants his request, makes him clean, charges him with silence, and – partially because the request for silence went unheeded – is forced to remain in desolate places to avoid the growing attention his ministry is receiving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, what to make of these things? As ministers within the Church, as followers of Jesus, I think we naturally (and rightly) tend to place ourselves in the place of Christ’s <em><strong>disciples</strong></em> when we work our way through Gospel texts.</p>
<p>However, with today’s episodes, I’d like us to consider what we can learn about our vocations from <strong>Peter’s mother-in-law</strong>, from <strong>Jesus himself</strong>, and from the <strong>leper</strong>. These, I believe, demonstrate the importance of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">service</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">prayer</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">proclamation</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">worship</span></p>
<p>First, as with several of Jesus’ miraculous healings, Peter’s mother-in-law is raised from her bed as a <em>foreshadowing of Christ’s resurrection</em>. And although the use of the verb <em>diakoneo</em> to mean “to serve, to wait upon,” is perfectly within the term’s semantic range, we should not fail to notice that the woman provides an apt example of the Christian life: just as she was raised from her bed and began to serve Christ and the disciples, we are raised from our sickness of Sin and Death for a purpose, unto a life of <em><strong>service</strong></em> within Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>Secondly, after an eventful night of healings and casting out demons, Jesus demonstrates for us the sustaining importance of <em><strong>prayer</strong></em>, even and especially in the lives of ministry big shots, by retreating to a deserted place in the early morning hours to pray to the Father. This lifestyle of prayer is what sustains his healing ministry, and also, thirdly, it sustains his <em><strong>preaching</strong></em> ministry.</p>
<p>Jesus does not lose focus in the midst of growing crowds. He takes time to be alone, to pray – and he relentlessly proclaims the coming Kingdom of God to the people. May we strike the same balance as our Lord in our ministries today.</p>
<p>Service. Prayer. Proclamation. And finally, <em><strong>Worship</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Notice the leper, condemned to a life of painful illness and perhaps even more painful social exclusion. Taking the risk that Jesus might recoil in horror at his presence, like countless others would have, the leper boldly asks, notice, not primarily for physical healing, but for <em>restoration to the worshiping community</em>!</p>
<p>We must keep the biblical, and not the clinical, meaning of “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">clean</span>” in mind here: <em><strong>acceptable and ready to worship the living God</strong></em>! Jesus reverses the normal contagion movement, transferring his cleanliness to the unclean man, restoring the leper to a life of worship. A beautiful exchange, one which Christ is still willing to make with us today! <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>However, are we as eager as the leper to be healed in order to worship God? To serve God? To pray to God? To proclaim God’s Kingdom?</strong></span></p>
<p>Let us not make healing a <em>self-centered</em> occurrence. Christ offers us healing and restoration for this fourfold purpose: <strong>service</strong>, <strong>prayer</strong>, <strong>proclamation</strong>, and <strong>worship</strong>.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A homily on James 2.1-13 (ESV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-1&#34;&gt;“My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,the Lord of glory.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-2&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30279&#34;&gt;For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-3&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30280&#34;&gt;and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-4&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30281&#34;&gt;have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-5&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30282&#34;&gt;Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-6&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30283&#34;&gt;But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;text Jas-2-7&#34; id=&#34;en-ESV-30284&#34;&gt;Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A homily on James 2.1-13 (ESV):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Jas-2-1">“My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,the Lord of glory.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-2" id="en-ESV-30279">For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,</span> <span class="text Jas-2-3" id="en-ESV-30280">and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”</span> <span class="text Jas-2-4" id="en-ESV-30281">have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-5" id="en-ESV-30282">Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-6" id="en-ESV-30283">But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?</span> <span class="text Jas-2-7" id="en-ESV-30284">Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?</span></p>
<p><span class="text Jas-2-8" id="en-ESV-30285">“If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-9" id="en-ESV-30286">But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-10" id="en-ESV-30287">For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.</span><span class="text Jas-2-11" id="en-ESV-30288">For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-12" id="en-ESV-30289">So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.</span> <span class="text Jas-2-13" id="en-ESV-30290">For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse immediately preceding this morning’s lesson, James 1:27, says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em><strong>religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world</strong></em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">purity from the world</span></em> on one hand, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>social justice for the oppressed</em></span> on the other. And yet, in a world which is stained by rampant injustice, <strong>these are not two different pursuits, but different facets of the same agenda</strong>. Just as we must not allow the manifold sins of the world to stain our souls, we must take care to not allow the deathly and selfish perspectives of the world to stain our vision!</p>
<p>The world says that this [slaps Bible] is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just a book</span>. We <strong>disagree</strong>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The world says that this [slaps altar] is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">just a table</span>. Just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">bread</span>. Just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">wine</span>. We <strong>disagree</strong>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>.</p>
<p>This [gestures to room] is <strong>more</strong> than mere <span style="text-decoration:underline;">meditation</span>. Our God is <strong>more</strong> than a divinized <span style="text-decoration:underline;">delusion</span>.</p>
<p><strong>We have wiped the world’s mud out of our eyes, to see more clearly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Very good!</strong></p>
<p>The world says that a poor, homeless, drug-addled woman is a broken human being. We <strong>agree</strong>.</p>
<p>The world says that a rich, well-dressed, influential man is a less-broken human being, or at least broken in a more comfortable way.</p>
<p>We <strong>agree</strong>. Or at least we’re constantly tempted to in the everyday moments of our lives! Sure, theoretically, in the midst of a homily perhaps, we’d give the right answer. But practically, brothers and sisters, we’re <em><strong>partial</strong></em>. Our vision is still <em><strong>stained</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We’ve been wooed by the world’s wisdom.</p>
<p>We allow the stratified contents and contours of the world <span style="text-decoration:underline;">around</span> us to dictate the distinctions <span style="text-decoration:underline;">among</span> us.</p>
<p>We make evil judgments – very subtle, to be sure, but just so, that much more evil judgments! – based on the way things <em><u>are</u></em>.</p>
<p>We are naïve newcomers to the law of liberty – to the law which gives freedom <em><strong>from</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are</span>, <em><strong>from</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">have been</span> as long as we can remember, and freedom <em><strong>for</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">once were</span>, in a garden unstained by Sin and Death. A freedom <em><strong>for</strong></em> the way things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ought to be</span>, and will be in a city illuminated by Christ himself.</p>
<p>Christ himself, the One of whom Isaiah spoke thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear, but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth</span>; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins”</strong></em> (Isaiah 11:1-5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friends, the rich are not inherently evil because of their possessions. We know this. They, <strong>we</strong>, have their own pains and problems, which we will need to address thoughtfully as a church providentially located in one of the world’s most affluent communities – and <strong>this is no easy task</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>But</strong></em></span> it would be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">easy</span> for us to allow the stratified realities around us to stain our vision, to keep us short-sighted, to keep us complacent that <strong>it would be just as unusual for the homeless and shabbily-clothed to join <span style="text-decoration:underline;">our</span> community</strong> (really <span style="text-decoration:underline;">join</span> us, not just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">visit</span>), <strong>as it would be for the rich and well-dressed to have joined the earliest Christians, or many of our impoverished brothers and sisters around the world today</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us fight hard against this subtle temptation.</p>
<p>Let us consider how we should best love and welcome those the world <span style="text-decoration:underline;">calls</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">treats</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sees</span> as “<em><strong>the least</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Let us <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>disagree</strong></span>! And <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>see much more</strong></span>!</p>
<p>Let us treat them as “<em><strong>the loved</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

(I began with a bit of a mic issue. Ignore the garbled first 10 seconds or so!)</strong></p>
<p>—</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The “hometown,” “home court” advantage is a very real occurrence in many areas of life. Familiar fans and supportive surroundings help us humans to perform better at many tasks, from singing to sports.</p>
<p><em><strong>But not in sermons.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is very seldom a home court advantage in preaching!</p>
<p>Family and close friends may inspire us to make the game-winning shot, or hit the highest note, but when it comes to the intimate affair of preaching God’s Word — of transcending the divide between <em>there &amp; then</em> and <em>here &amp; now</em>, making it clear how the words of Scripture should enlighten, encourage, confront, and challenge us — when it comes to preaching to family and friends, it’s <em><strong>hard</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Granted, it might be easier to impress, to invigorate, to lay on the rhetorical relish with grandiose gestures, dazzling diction, and absolutely awesome alliteration.</p>
<p>But that’s not preaching. That’s a <em><strong>show</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Preaching takes guts… It takes bravery to do the necessary hard work at the intersection between the stuff of God and the stuff of life.</p>
<p>Because, <strong>if what we Christians believe is TRUE, everything changes</strong>, and a preacher’s job is to make that clear.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to family and friends, it’s difficult to preach repentance to those who changed your diapers, calmed your tantrums, kept your secrets.</p>
<p>But every stressed out seminarian, every nervous young pastor preparing to preach to the home crowd, can take heart that the very One we preach, Jesus the Messiah, faced a similar challenge during his earthly preaching ministry.</p>
<h2 id="mark-1-5">Mark 1-5</h2>
<p>Please turn with me to the Gospel of Mark, beginning on page 836 of your pew Bibles.</p>
<p>To understand today’s Gospel text from Mark 6, we first need a bit of context from Mark chapters 1 through 5. Please follow along with me in your Bibles, glancing at the pages as I summarize these chapters.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I’d like us to note is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>Jesus is on a roll</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>Mark’s Gospel takes off quickly into the narrative of Jesus, who, after he is baptized by his forerunner John, is affirmed of his identity by the very voice of God. He is then driven yet sustained by the Spirit through the wilderness testings of Satan.</p>
<p>Jesus then returns from the wilderness and begins his preaching ministry in Galilee — boldly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.&rsquo;” (1:15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then calls his first disciples, who join him in his whirlwind ministry of preaching and teaching with authority, healing the sick, and casting out demons. So much for chapter 1!</p>
<p>In chapter 2, he challenges Jewish conceptions about the forgiveness of sins, fasting, and keeping Sabbath.</p>
<p>In chapter 3, we witness the first hints of outright opposition to Jesus on account of his unorthodox Sabbath practices, yet this is immediately followed by a description of Jesus’ growing crowd of followers.</p>
<p>Unfazed, Jesus calls and appoints the twelve apostles. He challenges the experts in Jewish Law, and scandalously stretches the boundaries of family.</p>
<p>In chapter 4, he teaches in parables, before commanding and calming the wind and the sea.</p>
<p>In chapter 5, he upsets an entire region by casting out a legion of demons. And before we get to chapter 6, he reverses death itself for the sake of a synagogue official, and reverses disease for the sake of a woman with a discharge of blood.</p>
<p><strong>In the face of FAITH,Jesus tells the dead to get up. He calls the physically, financially, and relationally destitute one “daughter.”</strong></p>
<p>Jesus is on a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>roll</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Jesus is up to something <strong>BIG</strong>, something <strong>NEW</strong>. He is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>bringing in the very kingdom of God</strong></span>, unexpectedly centered around HIMSELF, and NOTHING, NO ONE –</p>
<ul>
<li>not winds,</li>
<li>not waves,</li>
<li>not Pharisees,</li>
<li>not scribes,</li>
<li>not disease,</li>
<li>not destitution,</li>
<li>not demons,</li>
<li>not even DEATH – can stand in his way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, maybe <em><strong>one</strong></em> thing can.</p>
<h2 id="our-text-mark-61-13">Our Text: Mark 6:1-13</h2>
<p>We’re now on page 841, Mark chapter 6 begins this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He [Jesus] went away from there and came to his hometown [Nazareth], and his disciples followed him.</p>
<p>And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?”</p>
<p>And they took offense at him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, before I get to two negative aspects of the Nazarenes’ reaction, let’s consider two positives:</p>
<h3 id="first-in-verse-2-they-are-asking-the-right-questions">First, in verse 2, they are <strong>asking the right questions</strong>.</h3>
<p>They recognize that Jesus has wisdom, mighty works, mighty hands – things which should have reminded them of God himself:</p>
<p>The God who, according to Jeremiah (51:15),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“made the earth by his <strong>power</strong>, who established the world by his <strong>wisdom</strong>, and by his <strong>understanding</strong> stretched out the heavens.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The God who, according to Deuteronomy (4:34 and 7:19), rescued Israel from the house of slavery with a “<strong>mighty hand</strong> and an outstretched arm.”</p>
<p><strong>Jesus’ wisdom and mighty deeds should have persuaded them that God was up to something big, something new</strong>.</p>
<p>The Creator was <strong>re-creating</strong>. The Redeemer was <strong>rescuing</strong> and <strong>restoring</strong> — like Jesus had just done with Jairus’ daughter and the bleeding woman in chapter 5.</p>
<h3 id="second-in-verse-3-everything-the-hometown-crowd-says-is-factually-correct">Second, in verse 3, <strong>everything the hometown crowd says is factually correct!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Jesus was <em>in fact</em> a carpenter by family trade.</li>
<li>And although it’s perhaps a slur, or a reference to Joseph’s prior death, Jesus is <em>in fact</em> the “Son of Mary.”</li>
<li>He did <em>in fact</em> have siblings.</li>
<li>He was <em>in fact</em> from Nazareth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what’s wrong with the hometown reaction? Let me focus on two things:</p>
<h3 id="first-their-reaction-shows-us-that-span-styletext-decorationunderlineyou-can-ask-the-right-questions-with-the-wrong-attitudespan">First, their reaction shows us that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>you can ask the right questions with the wrong attitude</strong></span>.</h3>
<p>Sure, Jesus’ wisdom and mighty deeds should have persuaded them that God was up to something big, something new – and that they might have to change their lives because of it.</p>
<p>But instead, they ask their questions with incredulous skepticism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just who does Jesus think he is?</p>
<p>What right has he to say these things? To act this way?</p>
<p>We know who he really is. We watched him grow up!</p>
<p>He’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>just one of us</strong></em></span>, a normal Nazarene.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="second-then-their-reaction-shows-us-that-span-styletext-decorationunderlineyou-can-know-the-facts-and-miss-the-pointspan">Second, then, their reaction shows us that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>you can know the facts and miss the point</strong></span>.</h3>
<p>In fact, sometimes, you can use the facts in order to miss the point!</p>
<p>You can miss Truth with a capital “T” by focusing on the lowercase.</p>
<p>That’s what they’re doing here. The scandalized hometown crowd is bringing up the familiar, comfortable aspects of Jesus’ existence to give themselves a way out from underneath Jesus’ powerful claims on them and their future.</p>
<p>After all, they don’t have to repent in light of the coming Kingdom of God if this “King Jesus,” what with his preaching and working wonders like some kind of prophet, is really just the homeboy handyman who’s out of his mind, right?</p>
<p>So, Jesus responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.”</p>
<p>And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citing a familiar proverb of the day — something close to “familiarity breeds contempt” – Jesus steps into a long tradition of rejected prophets — those sent by Yahweh to diagnose the sins of his people and point them back to covenant loyalty, but repeatedly rejected because of their intensely unpopular proclamations.</p>
<p>Hear the haunting words of 2 Chronicles 36(:15-16). Commenting upon the faithlessness of Judah, it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.</p>
<p>But they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose against his people, until there was no remedy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(…speaking there of the Babylon exile)</p>
<p>Friends, <strong>Jesus is the remedy! He is Yahweh’s true Prophet! He brings us back from exile. He is the King in the Kingdom of God, with dominion over demons, disease, and death!</strong></p>
<p>And yet, in the face of stubborn unbelief at Nazareth, Mark is willing to say that Jesus was <em><strong>UNABLE</strong></em> to so a mighty work there.</p>
<p>Sure, he healed a few sick people, but <strong>whereas elsewhere in the Gospels it is the crowds who marvel at the mighty words and works of Jesus, here he himself is STUNNED by their unbelief!</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Sisters, brothers: <strong>You can know the facts, and miss the point. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Because FACTS aren’t FAITH.</span></strong></p>
<p>FAITH is not merely intellectual assent to true propositions about Jesus. Look back at Mark 5, to Jairus and the bleeding woman!</p>
<h4 id="faith-is-about-entrusting-yourself-your-entire-life-to-jesus-as-your-king--your-only-hope-your-only-lord"><strong>Faith is about entrusting yourself, your entire life, to Jesus as your King – your only Hope, your only Lord.</strong></h4>
<p>When you hear “<strong>faith</strong>,” think “<em>faithfulness</em>.” Think “<em>trust</em>.” Think “<em>loyalty</em>.”</p>
<p>Faith is something absolutely necessary for a relationship to exist. This is true with humans, and it’s true with God.</p>
<p>Knowing the right things, having the Creed memorized backwards and front, is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> the same as <strong>life-changing loyalty to Jesus Christ</strong>.</p>
<p>And, to be sure, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">faith cannot merely be produced by sheer force of will</span>. We would be nothing but <em>faithless</em> were it not for God’s <strong>grace</strong>.</p>
<p>But faith does involve our <strong>wills</strong>, our entire <strong>selves</strong>. It is something we <strong>commit</strong> to. It is something that, by God’s grace, we <strong>participate</strong> in.</p>
<p>And it is something that can be <em><strong>rejected</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Now, there are some in the world who would be perfectly comfortable to come right out say “<em>I reject and refuse Jesus as Lord.</em>” Unbelief can take the form of outright opposition to Jesus. In the Gospels, we see this in those who want Jesus dead.</p>
<p>But that’s not the rejection Jesus receives here at Nazareth. And, my guess is, that’s not the refusal he receives from me, from you, either.</p>
<p>Because, see, <strong>we’re prone to the subtler (and therefore greater) rejection of Jesus by making him to “just one of us.”</strong></p>
<p>Now, don’t misunderstand me. <strong>Jesus was and is fully human</strong>. He doesn’t save us from a distance. He dove from heaven’s heights into the muck and mire of our sin-stained existence to bring us back to God.</p>
<p>But this salvation involves <strong>repentance</strong>. It requires turning away from our faithless pursuit of Sin and Death. And it requires the faithfulness of turning toward our faithful God.</p>
<p>Salvation does not require us getting back to God on our own efforts or merit, but it does entail <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>complete and utter dependence on and allegiance to Jesus as King</strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>But, as we’ve seen, we can <span style="text-decoration:underline;">escape</span> total allegiance to King Jesus if he’s “<em><strong>just one of us Nazarenes</strong></em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Friends, King Jesus is not “<em>just one of us</em>“!</strong></p>
<p>He has his own agenda of cosmic redemption. He has his own approach, which often appears upside-down to us, because it involves repentance and self-sacrifice, because it includes suffering on a bloodstained Cross before the triumph of the Empty Tomb.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>King Jesus is not “<em>just one of us</em>“!</strong></span></p>
<h4 id="so-the-uncomfortable-question-stands-are-we-loyal-to-king-jesus-above-all-else-or-are-we-loyal-to-a-jesus-weve-made-span-styletext-decorationunderlinein-our-own-imagespan">So the uncomfortable question stands: Are we loyal to King Jesus above all else? Or are we loyal to a “<em>Jesus</em>” we’ve made <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in our own image</span>?</h4>
<p>King Jesus is not “<em><strong>middle-to-upper-class-American-Jesus</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, he cares about the welfare of those around the world and those in this country more than we do. His agenda surely has implications for life here in the United States of America, and it very well might require the hard work of being faithful with many resources and possessions.</p>
<p>But, hear me:</p>
<h4 id="king-jesus-doesnt-just-want-to-add-a-pearly-gate-to-our-picket-fences-he-doesnt-just-want-to-stamp-a-jesus-approved-ticket-to-heaven-on-our-pre-existent-american-dream">King Jesus doesn’t just want to add a pearly gate to our picket fences. He doesn’t just want to stamp a Jesus-approved ticket to heaven on our pre-existent American Dream.</h4>
<h4 id="he-wants-us-to-crucify-the-american-dream">He wants us to crucify the American Dream!</h4>
<h4 id="he-calls-us-to-abandon-our-self-centered-agendas-of-upward-mobility-and-instead-to-take-up-our-crosses-to-adopt-his-others-focused-agenda-of-self-sacrificial-love">He calls us to abandon our self-centered agendas of upward mobility, and instead to take up our crosses! To adopt his others-focused agenda of self-sacrificial love!</h4>
<p>And just like it was for Jesus’ hometown crowd back then, our easiest way out of this required repentance now is <strong>to make Jesus’ message a little less demanding and his mission a little bit more like our own</strong>, <em><strong>until finally, faithlessly – though we may worship Jesus with our lips – in our hearts, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">we worship only ourselves</span>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Briefly notice with me that, in Mark 6:7-13, Jesus sends out his disciples to do what he himself had been doing: preaching repentance, casting out demons, and healing the sick.</p>
<h4 id="king-jesus-followers-carry-forward-his-mission-do-we">King Jesus’ followers carry forward his mission. Do we?</h4>
<h4 id="will-we-in-faith-entrust-our-entire-lives-in-allegiance-to-him-no-matter-the-changes-no-matter-the-costs">Will we, in faith, entrust our entire lives in allegiance to him? No matter the changes? No matter the costs?</h4>
<h4 id="will-we-refuse-to-make-jesus-into-just-one-of-us">Will we refuse to make Jesus into “just one of us”?</h4>
<h4 id="king-jesus-has-dominion-over-disease-demons-and-death-does-he-have-dominion-over-our-dreams-and-desires">King Jesus has dominion over disease, demons, and death. Does he have dominion over our dreams and desires?</h4>
<p>By God’s grace — given to us in the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ our Lord — By God’s amazing grace, <strong>may these things be so, may we follow him <span style="text-decoration:underline;">faithfully</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<em>The Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones – Gustave Dore</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>37 The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and placed me in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones.<br>
2 He made me walk all around among them. I realized there were a great many bones in the valley and they were very dry.<br>
3 He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said to him, “Sovereign Lord, you know.”<br>
4 Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.<br>
5 This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones: Look, I am about to infuse breath into you and you will live.<br>
6 I will put tendons on you and muscles over you and will cover you with skin; I will put breath in you and you will live. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”</p>

You have exhibited great skill in making all of them;<br>
the earth is full of the living things you have made.</p>
<p>25 Over here is the deep, wide sea,<br>
which teems with innumerable swimming creatures,<br>
living things both small and large.</p>
<p>26 The ships travel there,<br>
and over here swims the whale you made to play in it.</p>
<p>27 All of your creatures wait for you<br>
to provide them with food on a regular basis.</p>
<p>28 You give food to them and they receive it;<br>
you open your hand and they are filled with food.</p>
<p>29 When you ignore them, they panic.<br>
When you take away their life’s breath, they die<br>
and return to dust.</p>
<p>30 When you send your life-giving breath, they are created,<br>
and you replenish the surface of the ground.</p>
<p>31 May the splendor of the Lord endure!<br>
May the Lord find pleasure in the living things he has made!</p>
<p>32 He looks down on the earth and it shakes;<br>
he touches the mountains and they start to smolder.</p>
<p>33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;<br>
I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist!</p>
<p>34 May my thoughts be pleasing to him!<br>
I will rejoice in the Lord.</p>

3 And tongues spreading out like a fire appeared to them and came to rest on each one of them.<br>
4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.</p>
<p>5 Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem.<br>
6 When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.<br>
7 Completely baffled, they said, “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?<br>

9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia,<br>

      <title>What does it mean to be human?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-human/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2015 22:38:13 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-to-be-human&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Does It Mean to Be Human?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clue to the answer lies in the asking of the question, for this act presupposes both a [human] subject and object in a dialectic of self-transcendence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Robert Jenson notes, “in asking this question, we somehow take up a vantage outside ourselves to make ourselves our own objects, get beyond ourselves to look back at ourselves.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The mystery of human existence is “that I am the subject of the object I am and the object of the subject I am.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-human"><em>What Does It Mean to Be Human?</em></h2>
<p>A clue to the answer lies in the asking of the question, for this act presupposes both a [human] subject and object in a dialectic of self-transcendence.</p>
<p>As Robert Jenson notes, “in asking this question, we somehow take up a vantage outside ourselves to make ourselves our own objects, get beyond ourselves to look back at ourselves.”<sup>1</sup> The mystery of human existence is “that I am the subject of the object I am and the object of the subject I am.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>But what do I see when I look at myself? At others? At God?</p>
<p>On our own, this self-transcendence leaves us humans at the mercy of our own divided desires – searching for definition. But with God, we receive our true humanity in the midst of divine discourse – finding significance in God’s recognition that we are true human beings. The failures of the former approach highlight the successes of the latter.</p>
<h1 id="divided-desires">DIVIDED DESIRES</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-i-see-when-i-look-at-umyselfu"><em>What Do I See When I Look at <u>Myself</u>?</em></h2>
<p>One driven by desire.</p>
<p>Based upon human behavior, Sigmund Freud rightly notes that the primary human desire is for happiness, which involves the avoidance of the pain and the pursuit of pleasure.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>However, I quickly discover that my own body, the external world, and human relationships oppose my pleasure-drive.<sup>4</sup> These oppositions help me to distinguish myself from that which is not me. For example, I am not the ground which hurts when I fall upon it. I am not my parents who fail to provide me with food the moment I desire it. I am not the external frustration and pain which I encounter. I am the one with the frustrated desires.</p>
<p>Despite the necessity of unfulfilled desires for human development in Freud’s framework, he recognized the unavoidable tensions which human beings experience as the result of two competing drives: Eros and Death.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>The former, Eros, is synonymous with <em>libido</em>, the desire for objects for the sake of preservation; while the latter, Death, leads to guilt when internalized, and aggression towards others.<sup>6</sup></p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-see-when-i-look-at-uothersu"><em>What Do I See When I Look at <u>Others</u>?</em></h2>
<p>Ones who both inform and frustrate my desires.</p>
<p>Now, on one hand, this is necessary and beneficial for development. As a child, I learn to desire to eat and speak like my parents.</p>
<p>However, as Rene Girard observes, when these imitative or mimetic desires are frustrated, they lead to rivalries.<sup>7</sup> When I desire something my neighbor possesses, and my neighbor prevents me from obtaining it, my desire for the object increases. Yet so does my neighbor’s desire, which produces tension between us.</p>
<p>Therefore, imitation distinguishes human desires from animal instincts for natural needs, yet simultaneously causes the conflicts of human existence. Mimetic desire “is responsible for the best and the worst in us, for what lowers us below the animal level as well as what elevates us above it.”<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Without a goal or <em>telos</em> to distinguish between right and wrong desires, I can only take cues from my neighbor and hope for a relative peace. Soon, “choice itself becomes the only thing that is inherently good,” as “all desires, good and bad, melt into the one overriding imperative to consume.”<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>When desire is turned in on itself, the pursuit of things (and not even the things themselves!) becomes my temporary respite from the restlessness of my existence. Since I cannot define myself, I go shopping instead.<sup>10</sup> And yet, I cannot shop forever.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-see-when-i-look-at-ugodu"><em>What Do I See When I Look at <u>God</u>?</em></h2>
<p>If human self-transcendence in search of definition is an enclosed circle, the most I will ever see is a personified, projected “god” who is the opposite of my weaknesses and the abstracted absolute of my strengths.</p>
<p>Why even bother positing such a “God”? Because I live my life as a narrative awaiting a conclusion – death – which, although it grants meaning to the plot, prevents me, its main actor, from ascertaining its final significance!</p>
<p>As Jenson dryly observes, “if the conclusion of our play, hidden as we play our temporal stories in the impenetrable future of death, is nevertheless already enacted, then it can only be enacted in something like the mind of an author, standing above the play and holding what in the play are past and future in a superior present, in the ‘all-at-once-now’ of eternity.”<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>And so I trade places with the indefinable God of past theological formulations, defining him against the contours of my own mysterious existence, which I expect him to justify and underwrite.<sup>12</sup> Yet if I worship a mere projection, I am left on my own.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-human-1"><em>What Does It Mean to Be Human?</em></h2>
<p>To be at the mercy of our own divided, conflicted, and frustrated desires.</p>
<p>Karl Barth best describes the failures of self-definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[T]he enterprise of setting up the ‘No-God’ (to justify our existence) is avenged by its success. […] Our conduct becomes governed precisely by what we desire. By a strict inevitability we reach the goal we have set before us. […] And now there is no higher power to protect [humans] from what they have set on high.”<sup>13</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My idols (whether myself, my neighbor, or my “God”) exhaust and finally crush me. The attempt to establish my own identity isolates me from myself, whom I do not know; my neighbor, whom I love to hate; my “God,” whom I project; and God, whom I ignore.</p>
<h1 id="divine-discourse">DIVINE DISCOURSE</h1>
<p>Who am I? What do I see when I look at God?</p>
<p>To solve the enigma of my own existence, I must reverse the latter question and expand the former.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-god-see-when-he-looks-at-umeu">What Does God See When He Looks at <u>Me</u>?</h2>
<p>As Barth rightly inveighs, God “is not the personified but the personifying person – the person on the basis of whose prior existence alone we can speak (hypothetically) of other persons different from Him.”<sup>14</sup> Therefore, humans “ought not to be independently what they are in dependence upon God.”<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>And because of this, I cannot define myself on my own, but merely describe the characteristics and tensions of my life. My self-transcendence has value only when it transcends the self in the context of a divine discourse.</p>
<p>As Eberhard Jüngel claims, “it is only as the human ‘I’ is addressed in such a way that it is simultaneously claimed by something outside itself, that one is really speaking about the human ‘I’ as such.”<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>I am told who I am by God, and thereby enabled to exist in proper relationship to God, to others, and to myself – the very relations that I jeopardize in self-definition.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Barth rightly insists that true humanity – true human personality – is only found in one place: the encounter between God and humanity. Therefore, on his own, “man is not a person, but becomes one on the basis that he is loved by God and can love God in return.”<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>In Jenson’s terms, humans are unique in that God relates to us as “his conversational counterpart,”<sup>19</sup> and this divine address to us “is the Son, who is the human person Jesus of Nazareth.”<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>Therefore, as Barth puts it, “the ontological determination of humanity is grounded in the fact that one man among all others is the man Jesus.”<sup>21 </sup>To be human is to be with God in the person of Christ.<sup>22</sup></p>
<h2 id="god-sets-us-free-for-himself-and-for-others">God Sets Us Free, for Himself and for Others</h2>
<p>If true, the grounding of humanity in divine discourse is a profound liberation, for “our acts [and our desires] cannot determine our being. Only the one who determines being and non-being determines our being.”<sup>23 </sup></p>
<p>And the Incarnation decisively reassures us that God recognizes us as human beings. Indeed, “the truly human person is the person who is definitively recognized by God, and in that way one who cannot be discredited by anything or anyone, not even by him- or herself.”<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>Once I see that the real God has, in Christ, broken through the veneer of my projected “God” to secure my humanity, I no longer have to drive myself mad trying to secure my humanity. I am freed to worship the true God, enabled to respond to his address in prayer and worship.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>I am also liberated to relate to my neighbor, not in conflict as a model/rival, but in love as a fellow human.</p>
<p>This is the ineluctable result of God’s incarnational address in Jesus Christ, for “to receive myself from God and be directed toward him is therefore to receive myself from and be directed toward a fellow human. And it is to receive myself from and be directed toward a human person who precisely to be himself brings others with him.”<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>Because he provides the <em>standard</em> by which human desires are evaluated, Christ, who exists completely for God and for others, calls and enables me to reorient my desires toward human flourishing, “the end of human life, which is participation in the life of God.”<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>I can now recognize the dignity of each fellow human, not as a means to my distorted ends, but as one whom God loves, one for whom Christ died.</p>
<p>As Martin Luther concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“as Christians we do not live in ourselves but in Christ and the neighbor. […] As Christians, we live in Christ through faith and in the neighbor through love. Through faith we are caught up beyond ourselves into God. Likewise, through love we descend beneath ourselves through love to serve our neighbor.”<sup>28</sup></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p><em>What does it mean to be human?</em> On my own, I am unable to answer the question.</p>
<p>In my efforts to secure my own existence, I can only describe my incoherent estate at the mercy of my divided and frustrated desires. I am a mystery to myself, I love to hate my neighbor, and I project a “God” to comfort myself in light of death.</p>
<p>Yet with God, I am enabled to receive my humanity in the midst of divine discourse, and to respond to his address to me in Christ through prayer, worship, and love of neighbor.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Just as sin is ontological impossibility, disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. The tension between the undeniable reality of sin and Karl Barth’s theological definition of sin as an impossible possibility parallels the tension between the obvious reality of a fractured church1 and the theological definition of the church as the one body of the one Christ. Two excerpts from the Barthian corpus legitimize this connection. First, in his prepared remarks to the 1937 Second World Conference on Faith and Order in Edinburgh, Karl Barth maintained that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we have no right to explain the multiplicity of the churches at all. <em><strong>We have to deal with it as we deal with sin</strong></em>, our own and others’, to recognize it as a fact, to understand it <em><strong>as the impossible thing which has intruded itself</strong></em>, as guilt which we must take upon ourselves, without the power to liberate ourselves from it. We must not allow ourselves to acquiesce in its reality; rather we must pray that it be forgiven and removed, and be ready to do whatever God’s will and command may enjoin in respect of it.2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, almost two decades later, Barth described as “impossible” that which he had earlier declared “unthinkable”3 – that certain Christian communities should “stand in relation to other groups of equally Christian communities in an attitude more or less of exclusion,” by claiming that “their confession and preaching and theology are mutually contradictory” (CD IV/1, 676).4 It is furthermore impossible “that the adherents of the one should be able to work together with those of the other in every possible secular cause, but not to pray together, not to preach and hear the Word of God together, not to keep the Lord’s Supper together” (CD IV/1, 676). Barth insists that, “in view of the being of the community as the body of Christ [, the disunity of the church] is – ontologically, we can say – quite <em><strong>impossible; it is possible only as sin is possible</strong></em>” (CD IV/1, 677; emphasis added).</p>
<p>In order to describe in Barthian terms what it means for church disunity to be possible only as sin is possible, the purpose of this paper is to correlate Barth’s anthropological concept of sin as ontological impossibility with its parallel ecclesiological concept: disunity as ecclesiological impossibility. I will then conclude by locating this discussion within Barth’s own ecumenical vision – with an eye toward informing and motivating further ecumenical efforts.</p>
<p>(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/theology-outline/">Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?</a>“)</p>
<h3 id="sin-as-ontological-impossibility">SIN AS ONTOLOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY</h3>
<p>In considering human sin, we must begin with what it means to be human. Although various attempts have been made to define humanity in the spheres of natural science, idealist ethics, existentialist philosophy, and theistic anthropology, Barth claims that these are merely descriptions of the <em>phenomena</em>, and not the essence, of humanity (CD III/2, 71-132).</p>
<p>Against these provisional anthropologies, Barth insists that true humanity – true human personality – is only found in one place, the encounter between God and man, and not in the reaches or intricacies of human emotion, intellect, or will. Therefore, on his own, “man is not a person, but becomes one on the basis that he is loved by God and can love God in return” (CD II/1, 284). This is because God “is not the personified but the personifying person – the person on the basis of whose prior existence alone we can speak (hypothetically) of other persons different from Him” (CD II/1, 285). Most importantly, “the One, the person, whom we really know as a human person, is the person of Jesus Christ, and even this is in fact the person of God the Son, in which humanity, without being or having itself a person, is caught up into fellowship with the personality of God” (CD II/1, 286). Christology determines anthropology, and not the other way around (CD I/1, 131).</p>
<p><strong>Christological Anthropology</strong></p>
<p>Although Barth grounds the definition of humanity in Christology, he is always careful to preserve a qualitative distinction between Christ’s humanity and humanity in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christology is not anthropology. We cannot expect, therefore, to find directly in others the humanity of Jesus, and therefore His fellow-humanity, His being for man, and therefore that final and supreme determination, the image of God. Jesus is man for His fellows, and therefore the image of God, in a way which others cannot even approach, just as they cannot be for God in the sense that He is. He alone is the Son of God, and therefore His humanity alone can be described as the being of an I which is wholly from and to the fellow-human Thou, and therefore a genuine I. (CD III/2, 222)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of framing this distinction between Christ and other humans in terms of a vague moral perfection, Barth portrays Christ as distinctly <em>more human</em> than humans in general – existing both <em>for God</em> and <em>for other humans</em> in a way which is unparalleled. Christ’s existence for other humans is “the direct correlative of His being for God,” and this reveals a correspondence between the existence and love of God <em>ad intra</em> – between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – and the existence and love of God <em>ad extra</em>to humanity (CD III/2, 220).</p>
<p>Humanity only exists within this Christological correspondence, this <em>analogia relationis</em> (CD III/2, 218-20, 225-6). Specifically, Barth grounds the humanity of individual humans in the notion of a shared sphere with Christ: “the ontological determination of humanity is grounded in the fact that one man among all others is the man Jesus” (CD III/2, 132). Therefore, “to be a man is to be with God,” for no matter what else each individual is, “he is on the basis of the fact that he is with Jesus and therefore with God” (CD III/2, 135). Because the incarnation is the fullest expression of the Creator’s summons to the creature into relationship, it is the ground of the human creature’s being and personality – distinguishing humanity from the other non-human spheres which Christ did not inhabit (CD III/2, 137).</p>
<h4 id="sin-is-the-impossible-possibility"><strong>Sin is the Impossible Possibility</strong></h4>
<p>However, the incarnation is also the source of sin’s absurdity. Because humanity “is not without God, but with God,” true “Godlessness, is not, therefore, a possibility, but an ontological impossibility for man” (CD III/2, 136). When it comes to sin, Barth simultaneously removes it from the definition of what it means to be human, and emphasizes its absurdity as part of human existence – for, although sin undeniably exists, “our being does not include but excludes sin. To be in sin, in godlessness, is a mode of being contrary to our humanity” (CD III/2, 136).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to make some provisional sense of sin’s existence, Barth claims that the distinction between Creator and creation necessarily entails the <em>possibility</em> of creaturely conflict with God. As opposed to the inherent impossibility of a conflict between God and himself <em>ad intra</em> ,5 “it is a mark of created being as distinct from divine that in it conflict with God and therefore mortal conflict with itself is not ruled out, but is a definite possibility even if it is only the impossible possibility, the possibility of self-annulment and therefore its own destruction” (CD II/1, 503). Positively, this reinforces the creature’s identity as simply that: a creature, owing its existence to God. In fact, “creature freed from the possibility of falling away would not really be living as a creature. It could only be a second God – and as no second God exists, it could only be God Himself” (CD II/1, 503). This distinction does not necessitate <em>actual sin</em>, however, for “sin is when the creature <em><strong>avails</strong></em> itself of this impossible possibility in opposition to God and to the meaning of its own existence” (CD II/1, 503; emphasis added). And, given the Christological and theological basis of human existence, it makes no sense for a human to actualize this possibility, for “if he denies God, he denies himself” and “chooses his own impossibility” (CD III/2, 136). In Barth’s evaluation, this one absurd decision underlies all actions which are usually considered sins, for “every offence in which godlessness can express itself, e.g., unbelief and idolatry, doubt and indifference to God, is as such, both in its theoretical and practical forms, and offence with which man burdens, obscures, and corrupts himself” (CD III/2, 136).</p>
<p>For Barth, therefore, sin is not merely moral – it is both ontological and incomprehensible: the inherent contradiction of a nothingness which opposes God as the very ground of all existence and reality (CD II/1, 532; III/3, 351). The value of this definition is its absurdity. Responding to the challenge (from Berkouwer) that defining sin as “nothingness,” an “impossible possibility,” or an “ontological impossibility” seems “to suggest or imply a denial of the reality of evil,” Barth maintains that “it is of a piece with the nature of evil that if we could explain how it may have reality it would not be evil. Nor are we really thinking of evil if we think we can explain this” (CD IV/3, 177). His subsequent clarification is especially instructive for this discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I speak of nothingness, I cannot mean that evil is nothing, that it does not exist, or that it has no reality. I mean that it exists only in the negativity proper to it in its relationship to God and decisively in God’s relationship of repudiation to it. It does not exist as God does, nor as His creatures, amongst which it is not to be numbered. It has no basis for its being. It has no right to the existence which to our sorrow we cannot deny to it. Its existence, significance and reality are not distinguished by any value nor positive strength. The nature underlying its existence and activity is perversion. Its right to be and to express itself is simply that of wrong. In this sense it is nothingness. (CD IV/3, 178)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the phrase “impossible possibility” is designed to reflect “the absurd possibility of the absurd,” and “ontological impossibility” to state that “the nature of evil as the negation negated by God disqualifies its being, and therefore its undeniable existence, as impossible, meaningless, illegitimate, valueless and without foundation” (CD IV/3, 178). Easily understood definitions of evil are perhaps evil themselves, obfuscating sin’s inherent incomprehensibility.</p>
<p>Given the definition of humanity and the absurdity of sin, there is a tension between humanity’s Christological being/essence and its sinful act/form. As Barth puts it, “perhaps the fundamental mistake in all erroneous thinking of man about himself is that he tries to equate himself with God and therefore to proceed on the assumption that he can regard himself as the presupposition of his own being” (CD III/2, 151). However, if there is one presupposition allowed in Barth’s epistemological non-foundationalism, it is the anthropological presupposition of God and his Word as the ground of human being – divine election as the frontier beyond which we cannot look for a human being “not yet summoned” (CD III/2, 151). Just as there is no God behind God, there is no humanity beyond the divine summons, beyond existence in the same sphere inhabited by Christ. It is therefore unthinkable that humanity should try to be the source of its own existence, and yet this is precisely that which occurs.</p>
<p>For Barth, this absurdity takes on the character of improper judgment: “all sin has its being and origin in the fact that man wants to be his own judge” (CD IV/1, 220). Although “not all men commit all sins,” everyone commits “this sin which is the essence and root of all other sins” (CD IV/1, 220). Self-justification and the damnation of the others characterize sin as “the arrogance in which man wants to be his own and his neighbour’s judge,” wanting “to be able and competent to pronounce ourselves free and righteous and others more or less guilty” (CD IV/1, 231). Sinful humanity tries to ground its own existence by carving-out its own improper position as judge.</p>
<h4 id="atonements-intensification-of-sins-absurdity"><strong>Atonement’s Intensification of Sin’s Absurdity</strong></h4>
<p>Yet sin becomes an even further absurdity in light of the atonement. In fact, the tension between humanity’s Christological essence and its sinful form is a driving force in the doctrine of reconciliation, for “the incompatibility of the existence of Jesus Christ with us and us with Him, the impossibility of the co-existence of His divine-human actuality and action and our sinfully human being and activity” must be addressed before we can rest assured “that Jesus Christ belongs to us and we belong to Him, that His cause is our cause and our cause is His” (CD IV/1, 348). As an answer to this predicament, “the event of redemption in Jesus Christ not only compromises this position [of improper human judgment], but destroys it” (CD IV/1, 232).</p>
<p>This displacement of humanity by Christ is the source of both its abasement and liberation, the former because, although self-justification always results in a verdict of my own innocence, “He who has acted there as Judge will also judge me, and He and not I will judge others” (CD IV/1, 233). However, it is also the source of freedom from the wearisome and “intolerable nuisance to have to be convincing ourselves that we are innocent, we are in the right” (CD IV/1, 233). With relevance to our subsequent ecclesiological discussion, Barth adds that it is similarly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an affliction always to have to make it clear to ourselves so that we can cling to it that others are in one way or another in the wrong, and to have to rack our brains how we can make it clear to them, and either bring them to an amendment of their ways or give them up as hopeless, withdrawing from them or fighting against them as the enemies of all that is good and true and beautiful. (CD IV/1, 233-4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ liberates us from the tiresome task we were never meant to complete.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in taking our improper place as judge, he also takes away from us the just sentence we merited by taking up that position in the first place. Christ “takes from us our own evil case, taking our place and burdening himself with it,” and “it [therefore] ceases to be our sin” (CD IV/1, 236). Due to this exchange, he “is the unrighteous amongst those who can no longer be so because He was and is for them” (CD IV/1, 237), because he has delivered “sinful man and sin in His own person to the non-being which was properly theirs” (CD IV/1, 253). Christ destroys human faithlessness by taking it to its absurd conclusion: annihilation.</p>
<p>Because of this, humans “have no other ground to do evil now that the ground has been cut out from under our feet” (CD IV/1, 243). Considering Christ’s work both for us and in us, Barth maintains that “unfaithfulness to God is a disallowed possibility which can no longer be actualised. It is seen to be the wholly impossible possibility on which we can no longer count, which we see to be eliminated and taken from us by God’s omnipotent contradiction set up in us” (CD IV/4, 22). In light of the doctrine of reconciliation, repentance from sin is the only viable human response. Only by ignoring Christ and his accomplished atonement, only by denying the source of our own existence can we presume to have the freedom to sin, to reject God, and to be our own judges.</p>
<h4 id="disunity-as-ecclesiological-impossibility">DISUNITY AS ECCLESIOLOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY</h4>
<p>Humanity’s Christological definition results in sin as an absurdity which is intensified by the atonement. The church’s Christological definition similarly results in disunity as an absurdity which is intensified by the atonement. As we began with what it means to be human, so we begin with what it means to be the church.</p>
<p>Just as Barth resists an anthropology that is based upon the mere phenomena of humanity, he resists an ecclesiology that is based upon the mere phenomena of the church. Although the church is “a phenomenon of world history which can be grasped in historical and psychological and sociological terms like any other” (CD IV/1, 652), what the church actually is, “the character, the truth of its existence in time and space, is not a matter of a general but a very special visibility” (CD IV/1, 654). And just as grasping the Christological essence of humanity allows for a true appreciation of humanity’s historical form,6 understanding the Christological essence of the church allows the community to “act confidently on the level of its phenomenal being” (CD IV/1, 660). This includes ecumenical pursuits.</p>
<h4 id="christological-ecclesiology"><strong>Christological Ecclesiology</strong></h4>
<p>For Barth, Christology determines both anthropology and ecclesiology, and there is therefore no “abandonment of the sphere of the [Apostles’] creed” when the transition is made from the second to the third article.7 He offers a conceptual map at this juncture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Christology is like a vertical line meeting a horizontal. The doctrine of the sin of man is the horizontal line as such. The doctrine of justification is the intersection of the horizontal line by the vertical. The remaining doctrine, that of the Church and of faith, is again the horizontal line, but this time seen as intersected by the vertical. The vertical line is the atoning work of God in Jesus Christ. The horizontal is the object of that work; man and humanity. (CD IV/1, 643)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is therefore a Chalcedonian pattern, 8 not only to Christ’s person, but also to his work. This unavoidably includes the Holy Spirit’s work, awakening and forming the church, which is itself the subjective realization of the eternal election of Jesus Christ (CD IV/1, 667).9 In Barth’s terms: “the one reality of the atonement has both an objective and a subjective side in so far as – <em>we cannot separate but we must not confuse the two</em> – it is both a divine act and offer and also an active human participation in it” (CD IV/1, 643; emphasis added).</p>
<p>For this reason, “the history which we consider when we speak of the Christian community and Christian faith is enclosed and exemplified in the history of Jesus Christ” (CD IV/1, 644). Barth takes seriously the New Testament language of the church as Christ’s “body,” and claims that “the community is the earthly-historical form of existence of Jesus Christ himself” (CD IV/1, 661). As Christ is the head of his body, the church, he is the ground of its particular existence. Just as the incarnation grounds human existence, it determines ecclesiological existence. And because Christology and ecclesiology are inseparably intertwined, the Chalcedonian pattern which unites the church with the person of Christ also applies to the relationship between the church’s being and its act – between its invisible essence and its visible form.</p>
<h4 id="disunity-is-the-impossible-possibility"><strong>Disunity is the Impossible Possibility</strong></h4>
<p>This union, however, parallels the aforementioned tension between humanity’s essence and its form, given its Christological definition and the absurdity of sin. As Bender notes, “Barth’s dialectical understanding of the church as both an invisible and visible reality, an event of the Holy Spirit and a historical entity, leads naturally to his dialectical understanding of the marks of the church: the church as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.”10 Within the context of the first mark, there is a tension between the church’s being/essence as <em>one</em>, and its act/form as <em>many</em>.</p>
<p><em>Credo unam ecclesiam</em>(I believe one church) entails that there is “only one Church. This means that it belongs to the being of the community to be a unity in the plurality of its members, i.e., of the individual believers assembled in it, and to be a simple unity, not having a second or third unity of the same kind side by side with it” (CD IV/1, 668). This follows not just a Christological pattern, but a Trinitarian one as well, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all the riches of His divine being the God who reconciled the world with Himself in Jesus Christ is One. Jesus Christ, elected the Head of all men and as such their Representative who includes them all in Himself in His risen and crucified body is One. The Holy Spirit in the fulness and diversity of His gifts is One. In the same way His community as the gathering of the men who know and confess Him can only be one. (CD IV/1, 668)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the source of the church’s unity, in the midst of legitimate plurality, between the visible and invisible church and between the <em>ecclesia militans</em> and the <em>ecclesia triumphans</em> (CD IV/1, 669).11 The only other legitimate church plurality is the existence of “geographically separated and therefore different congregations.” (CD IV/1, 671). If the church is to exist “in essential accordance with its commission it has to take place in many localities,” then this necessarily entails a differentiation which corresponds to “its environment and history and language and customs and ways of life and thought as conditioned by the different localities, and also to its personal composition” (CD IV/1, 671). Because it is grounded in God’s Triune unity, the church’s unity does not necessitate homogeneity, and Barth grants that each local congregation should exist within the particularities of its own context.</p>
<p>However, this cannot entail any sort of basic or essential difference between one local congregation and another, for “each in its own place can only be the one community beside which there are no others. Each in and for itself and with its local characteristics can only be the whole, as others are in their own locality” (CD IV/1, 672). No other legitimate plurality within the church exists, for “any other plurality means the co-existence of Churches which are genuinely divided” – churches that, at best will kindly “tolerate one another as believing differently, and at worst they will fight against one another, mutually excluding each other with some definiteness and force” (CD IV/1, 675).</p>
<p>And yet this is exactly the scandalous reality of the church. Although there are myriad reasons for ecclesiological divisions throughout the ages, Barth’s distillation of myriad human sins to improper judgment as “the essence and root of all other sins ” helps to make sense of the scandal of the fragmented church. Just as humans demonstrate the sinful tension between their essence and form by improperly justifying themselves and damning others, the church demonstrates the sinful tension between its unified being and its divided act when individual Christian communities justify their own existence <em>over against</em> the existence of other Christian communities. Because this is the case, Barth is even willing to claim that the church’s formal division has <em>essential</em> implications: “in its visible and also in its invisible being, in its form and also in its essence, the one community of Jesus Christ is not one” (CD IV/1, 679). While it is expected that every Christian community would claim an individual encounter with its Lord which justifies its own existence, this can quickly become a perverse insistence that the “Yes” of Christ has been exclusively spoken to them. This “claim to be identical with the one Church in contrast to the others, and in this sense to be the only Church” entails a delegitimation, whether implicit or explicit, of every other community’s claim to stand under the “Yes” of Christ (CD IV/1, 683-4). The local congregation, instead of existing in harmony with and as a manifestation of the one church, becomes a ghetto by restricting the cosmic boundaries of Christ’s church to its own four walls.</p>
<p>While there may be legitimate human explanations for such divisions, there are no acceptable theological ones, Barth claims, for a “plurality of Churches in this sense means a plurality of lords, a plurality of spirits, a plurality of gods” – a practical denial of the church’s theoretical confession of the singular unity of the Triune God (CD IV/1, 675). Just as it is absurd for humans to oppose God as the very ground of their existence, it is equally absurd for the church to divide in denial of the unity of God.</p>
<h4 id="atonements-intensification-of-disunitys-absurdity"><strong>Atonement’s Intensification of Disunity’s Absurdity</strong></h4>
<p>Just as the atonement intensifies the anthropological absurdity of sin, it intensifies the ecclesiological absurdity of disunity. As Barth puts it, the previously-described exclusive claim of a Christian community to be the only church “has been dashed out of hand by the One who is the unity of the Church” (CD IV/1, 684). In making an end of the nothingness of human sin, Christ has also delivered up disunity to destruction, for “in Him it was all humanity in its corruption and lostness, its earthly-historical existence under the determination of the fall, which was judged and executed and destroyed, and in that way liberated for a new determination, for its being as a new humanity” (CD IV/1, 663). The unity which is necessarily implied in Barth’s Christological description of election is realized in the church. Members of the community “were one in God’s election (Eph 1:4), were and are one in the fulfilment of it on Golgotha, are one in the power of His resurrection, one in Jesus Christ…His body together in their unity and totality” (CD IV/1, 664). Most succinctly, “there is only one Christ, and therefore there is only one body of Christ” (CD IV/1, 666). Disunity in the church is therefore absurd, because it denies the definition of the church as Christ’s body, and the reality of reconciliation as Christ’s work.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-toward-a-barthian-ecumenism">CONCLUSION: TOWARD A BARTHIAN ECUMENISM</h3>
<p>I have endeavored to demonstrate the significance of Karl Barth’s remark that disunity in the church “is only possible as sin is possible,” by showing the structural parallels between his anthropological claim that sin is ontological impossibility and the claim that disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. Yet the value of this correlation for ecumenism is not readily apparent until it is situated within Barth’s own ecumenical vision.</p>
<p>For Karl Barth, the Chalcedonian pattern of both Christology and ecclesiology applies when addressing the tension between the church’s essence and form.12 On one hand, the solution to ecclesiological disunity must not entail a docetic escapism which unifies the church at the expense of its earthly-historical form. No matter how frustrated ecumenists become, they must not abandon their ecclesiological traditions to create a formless Christianity whose only members are themselves. Because the church’s external divisions result from essential, inward fractures, “neither individuals nor the whole Church can overcome it by a flight to the invisible, but only by a healing of both its visible and its invisible hurt” (CD IV/1, 678). On the other hand, because “what is demanded is the unity of the Church of Jesus Christ, not the externally satisfying co-existence and co-operation of different religious societies,” Barth is suspicious of ebionitic approaches to church unity which approach the unification of the church as the unification of any other human communities, looking for the least common denominators upon which to build pragmatic associations (CD IV/1, 678).</p>
<p>Instead, Barth maintains that the pursuit of church unity must be an indirect pursuit – not an end in itself, but an unavoidable consequence of each Christian community sincerely pursuing the call of its Lord, and each individual doing so from a sober and humble loyalty to one’s particular confession (CD IV/1, 679).13 Barth asserts that “if only each church will take itself seriously, ‘itself and Christ within it,’ then even if there be no talk of union movements in it, even if there be no change at all in its order and its way of worship, the one Church would be in that single church a present reality and visible.”14 Because Christ, not Christians, is the ground of the church’s unity, an individual community can exhibit the unity of the church, even within a fractured ecclesiological landscape, “if in its ordinances it is zealous for Christ.”15</p>
<p>And yet this is the most difficult ecumenism of all, for it entails rigorous self-examination within each community, which must be willing to ask itself constantly whether it has legitimate reasons to exist as a particular, differentiated Christian community, or whether it should redefine (or abandon) its boundaries for the sake of church unity (CD IV/1, 680-1). I believe the correlation between sin as ontological impossibility and disunity as ecclesiological impossibility is necessary precisely at this point in the ecumenical equation, for each community’s self-examination and pursuit of Christ’s unifying summons will only be as rigorous as its understanding of the absurdity of church fragmentation. Just as sinful humanity denies the ground of its own existence, so also a divided and divisive church denies its identity as Christ’s body and the reality of the atonement. Unless the disunity of Christ’s body is seen as an unacceptable scandal, the schisms will remain, and each community’s confession, “<em>credo unam ecclesiam</em>,” will mean nothing more than “we believe ourselves.”</p>

<p>NOTES:<br>
1 As Bender notes, “the referent for Barth’s term [whether ‘community’ or ‘church’] must be determined by context,” whether it refers to the local congregation, the institution, or the universal body of Christ. See Kimlyn Bender, <em>Karl Barth’s Christological Ecclesiology</em> (Hampshire/Burlington: Ashgate Publishing, 2005; repr. Eugene, OR: Cascade, 2013), 13. I have followed Bender’s approach in that, throughout this study, “church” is only capitalized in quotations, when Barth himself did so.<br>
2 Karl Barth, <em>The Church and the Churches</em> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1936; repr., 2005), 22-3. Emphasis added.<br>
3 Note the similarities: “It is then <em><strong>unthinkable</strong></em> that to those multiplicities which are rooted in unity we should have to add that which tears it in pieces; <em><strong>unthinkable</strong></em> that great entire groups of communities should stand over against each other in such a way that their doctrines and confessions of faith are mutually contradictory…. that the adherents of the one should be at one with those of another in every conceivable point except that they are unable to pray together, to preach and hear God’s word together, and to join together in Holy Communion.” Barth, <em>The Church and the Churches</em>, 24.<br>
4 The reference is to Vol. IV, pt. 1 of Karl Barth, <em>Church Dogmatics.</em> (eds. G.W. Bromiley and T.F. Torrance; trans. G.W. Bromiley; 5 vols in 14 parts; Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1936-77; repr., Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2010). All references to the <em>Church Dogmatics</em> appear parenthetically in the following form: “CD I/1, 1.”<br>
5 “It is a mark of the divine nature as distinct from that of the creature that in it a conflict with Himself is not merely ruled out, but is inherently impossible. If this were not so, if there did not exist perfect, original and ultimate peace between the Father and the Son by the Holy Spirit, God would not be God. Any God in conflict with Himself is bound to be a false God” CD II/1, 503.<br>
6 Consider Barth’s positive, yet provisional, appraisal of the phenomena-based anthropologies: “In this way and in this sense, then, a knowledge of man which is non-theological but genuine is not only possible but basically justified and necessary even from the standpoint of theological anthropology…. It cannot, of course, lead us to the knowledge of real man. But it may proceed from or presuppose a knowledge of real man” CD III/2, 200-2.<br>
7 “It is significant that at this point, the transition from the second to the third article, the word <em>credo</em> is specifically mentioned. It tells us that we can know the man who belongs to Jesus Christ only in faith.” CD IV/1, 644.<br>
8 Bender credits George Hunsinger with identifying this theme, based upon Barth’s own description of the ecumenical councils’ doctrinal decisions as “guiding lines for an understanding of [Christ’s] existence and action, not to be used, as they have been used, as stones for the construction of an abstract doctrine of His ‘person’” (CD IV/1, 127). See Bender, <em>Christological Ecclesiology</em>, 3.<br>
9 As Bender helpfully notes, “there is, then, not only a direct Christological analogy between Christ and the community, but an indirect Trinitarian and pneumatological one, in that, as the Spirit binds together the Father and the Son (in the Trinity); and as the Spirit binds together the Word and flesh of Christ (in the incarnation); so also the Holy Spirit binds together Christ and the community.” Bender, <em>Christological Ecclesiology</em>, 205. However, in touching so lightly upon the work of the Holy Spirit in this paper, I share Barth’s exclamatory sentiment: “How gladly we would hear and know and say something more, something more precise, something more palpable concerning the way in which the work of the Holy Spirit is done!” (CD IV/1, 649). Furthermore, despite the brief mention of election, it is significant that Barth grounds the unity between Christology and ecclesiology, not in the event of Pentecost, preaching, or the sacraments, but in the election of Jesus Christ from all eternity. The church “became His body, they became its members, in the fulfillment of their eternal election in His death on the cross of Golgotha, proclaimed in His resurrection from the dead” (CD IV/1, 667).<br>
10 Bender, <em>Christological Ecclesiology</em>, 181.<br>
11 It is also the source of the unity between Israel and the Church, which Barth describes as the “two forms and aspects (CD II, 2, § 34, 1) of the one inseparable community in which Jesus Christ has His earthly-historical form of existence, by which He is attested to the whole world, by which the whole world is summoned to faith in Him.” CD IV/1, 669-70.<br>
12 I am indebted to Bender’s helpful description of Barth’s critical use of a docetic/ebionitic framework. See Bender, <em>Christological Ecclesiology</em>, 7.<br>
13 See also Barth, <em>The Church and the Churches</em>, 51-2.<br>

<p><a href="http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/12-28-14JoshSteeleHolyInnocents.mp3">Today is December 28</a> (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents">The Slaughter of the Innocents</a>,” the killing of the baby boys of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> by King <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod_the_Great">Herod</a>.</p>
<p>The Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07419a.htm">to at least the fifth century</a>. In the fourth century, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatius">Chromatius</a> described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf.

<p>What if we knew the names of the victims of Herod’s infamous, paranoid rage?</p>
<p>What if the cries of Bethlehem took place today in Birmingham?</p>
<p>…For [REDACTED (NAMES OF BOYS IN CHURCH AGED TWO AND UNDER)]</p>

<p>May it never, ever be.</p>
<p>But what if such a tragedy took place inside our community?</p>
<p>Bright young lives, cut short by darkness.A deafening silence replaces the cries of the young.The tears of the parents a lingering reminder of the tears of their lost children.</p>
<p>May it never, ever be.</p>
<p>But it has been… and it frequently is… true.The small and the young are slaughtered by the big and supposedly powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hebrew babies, by Pharaoh.</li>
<li>Bethlehem’s young, by Herod.</li>
<li>Babies not yet born, by their parents.</li>
<li>Babies already born, by their parents.</li>
<li>Sandy Hook Elementary students, by Adam Lanza.</li>
<li>Students in Peshawar, by the Pakistani Taliban.</li>
<li>Pakistani children, by U.S. drone strikes.</li>
<li>Central American children, by gangs and drug lords…</li>
</ul>
<p>May it never, ever be?</p>
<p>Lord , have mercy! Lord Jesus, come quickly! For these things so often ARE.</p>
<p>You do not have to look far to spot evil.You do not have to look much further to spot violence that victimizes children.</p>
<p>This is not an ancient Egyptian or Judean issue,it is an issue for today – an issue for eternity.If it is not happening today in our community,it IS happening right now in some community.</p>
<p>Consider this, today, as we commemorate the “Holy Innocents” of Bethlehem– nameless to us,but called by name by both their parents and their God.</p>
<p>Consider this, today, as we contemplate <strong>how the Incarnation unveils both the source of and the desperate need for hope</strong>…the brilliant light of Christ against the dark backdrop of intense evil and incomprehensible suffering.</p>
<p>Let us pray…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O ALMIGHTY God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by their deaths: Mortify and kill all vices in us, and so strengthen us by thy grace, that by the innocency of our lives, and constancy of our faith even unto death, we may glorify thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve said that the Incarnation unveils both the source of and the desperate need for hope.Let us consider both together as we turn to <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearABC/HolyDays/HolyInno.html#GOSPEL">today’s Gospel text, Matthew 2:13–18</a>.</p>
<p>The structure of this passage is easy enough to ascertain.</p>
<ul>
<li>It begins, in vv. 13-15, by depicting the flight of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus from Bethlehem to Egypt – concluding in v. 15 with a quotation from Hosea 11:1.</li>
<li>Then, in vv. 16-18, we witness the grisly scene at Bethlehem, which is then linked by Matthew to a quotation from Jeremiah 31:15.</li>
<li>Although this sermon will only address these 6 verses, vv.19-23 complete the symmetry of these events by depicting the return of the family from Egypt to Nazareth in Galilee.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, then:</p>
<h2 id="i-in-telling-of-the-flight-to-egyptvv-13-15-portray-jesus-as-the-new-moses-the-true-israeland-the-source-of-hope">I. IN TELLING OF THE FLIGHT TO EGYPT,VV. 13-15 PORTRAY JESUS AS THE NEW MOSES, THE TRUE ISRAEL,AND THE SOURCE OF HOPE.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”</p>
<p>And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod.</p>
<p>This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet,</p>
<p>“Out of Egypt I called my son.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-the-flight">A. THE FLIGHT</h3>
<p>Verse 13 begins by referring to the departure of the wise men, after offering their now-famous gifts. And just as they were warned in a dream to take an alternate route home to avoid Herod, so Joseph is commanded in a dream by a messenger of the Lord to flee to Egypt to avoid Herod.</p>
<p>Herod the Great’s attempts to destroy the Christ-child here echo the much earlier attempts of Pharaoh to kill Moses in the book of Exodus – first, generally and unwittingly, by ordering all Hebrew baby boys to be cast into the Nile (Exod. 1:22); and then, even more specifically, when Pharaoh tried to kill Moses after Moses’ had murdered a nameless Egyptian (Exod. 2:15). In this way, Matthew links Herod with Pharaoh, and Jesus with Moses.</p>
<p>Therefore , although Egypt was, in the immediate sense, a natural destination to escape Herod’s jurisdiction, Matthew is drawing deeper connections. Egypt was the house of slavery from which the nation of Israel was redeemed. It is significant, then, that the Son of God goes there as a refugee before returning to the land of Israel to redeem the world.</p>
<p>The urgency of the angel’s command matches the urgency with which it was obeyed. The family made the approximately 90 mile journey, beginning under cover of darkness. And they obediently remained there u<br>
ntil receiving further instructions – until Herod would later die, allowing them to return and to journey to Nazareth in Galilee.</p>
<h3 id="b-the-fulfillment">B. THE FULFILLMENT</h3>
<p>And then Matthew says that these things happened in order that that which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet – in this case, the prophet Hosea – might be fulfilled: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” As I have mentioned, this comes from Hosea 11, from a beautiful prophetic passage which begins by speaking of Israel and the Exodus – the formative event in the birth of the young nation, the young “son” of God.</p>
<p>This way of speaking about Israel as God’s son comes from the book of Exodus itself, when Moses is told to tell Pharaoh ***“Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son,*<em><strong>and I say to you ‘Let my son go that he may serve me” (4:22–23a).</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a metaphorical use of the word “son” to refer to the relationship between Yahweh and his people. However, as the Exodus passage continues, if Pharaoh refused to let Yahweh’s metaphorical firstborn son go, Yahweh would kill Pharaoh’s literal firstborn son.</p>
<p>Literal and metaphorical sonship collide in the person of Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God who fully shares the divine nature of his Father, and he is also the Son of God who fulfills the calling and the destiny of the nation of Israel.Here his sojourn in Egypt fulfills the Exodus. Later, in Matthew 4, his wilderness temptation fulfills the Old Testament wilderness wanderings.Jesus is not just the New Moses. He is the True Israel.</p>
<p>Only when divine sonship is seen as an important biblical theme does this Hosea quotation make sense. Matthew is not proof-texting here, because in the Hosea passage, the “son” immediately turns away from Yahweh to idolatry in the very next verse!Instead , Matthew is claiming that the link Hosea made between the people of Israel and God’s “son” finds its fullest meaning – it is fulfilled and completed – in the person of Jesus.</p>
<p>Already , early in Matthew’s Gospel, we get the sense that Christ is going to change things, He’s going to complete God’s mission of setting the world right again.</p>
<p>I wish I could end there. However,</p>
<h2 id="ii-in-telling-of-the-slaughter-of-the-innocentsvv-16-18-reveal-the-desperate-need-for-hope"><strong>II. IN TELLING OF THE SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS,VV. 16-18 REVEAL THE DESPERATE NEED FOR HOPE.</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.</p>
<p>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</p>
<p>“A voice was heard in Ramah,</p>
<p>weeping and loud lamentation,</p>
<p>Rachel weeping for her children;</p>
<p>she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-the-massacre"><strong>A. THE MASSACRE</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents#cite_note-17">estimates</a>, the number of baby boys killed in the region of Bethlehem would have been between 10 and 30.In the course of the Church’s commemoration of this event, the number has grown drastically – to 14,000; 64,000; or even 144,000.</p>
<p>Of course , some have gone to the opposite extreme and claimed that this event never actually happened.Matthew must have been making this story up to draw the connections between Jesus and Moses. He had the Old Testament texts and made a story to match.</p>
<p><strong>That’s one way around this difficult text,but I think it’s a cop-out.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew quotes Jeremiah 31:15 and therefore creates a link in reverse to the Old Testament passage. However, in a certain sense, this link only works in one direction. That is, if one only had Jeremiah 31:15, it is obviously not a straightforward prophecy of a bloodthirsty ruler killing babies.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew is using the Old Testament to make some sense of this senseless slaughter, not to create it.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore , this massacre at Bethlehem fits quite well with the historical portrait we have of Herod – especially in his later years. Herod was crazy. If he thought you were a threat to his power, goodbye! The man even killed three of his own sons.</p>
<p>It is therefore not altogether surprising that, as terrible as it was, the deaths of a dozen or so babies in the hill town of Bethlehem would not have made it into the secular history books of that violent period.</p>
<p>I still think it happened.</p>
<p>Does that make you feel any better?</p>
<p>Perhaps a victory for the historical reliability of the Gospel accounts, but at what cost?</p>
<p>We’re still left with bereaved mothers and bloodstained cribs.</p>
<p>I don’t feel any better.</p>
<p>Although I’m sure I’ll find this passage even more poignant when, Lord-willing, I am a parent myself someday,some of its true weight hit me for the first time when, after reading the passage together, my wife (a pediatric nurse) started to tear-up and, after a long silence, said: “<em><strong>I don’t understand why those children had to die for Jesus to come… If I’m honest, it makes me angry</strong></em>.”</p>
<p><u>She has a point, right?</u> If God could save Jesus from bloodthirsty Herod, why not the Bethlehem babies? Didn’t the angel of the Lord have enough free time to show up in the dreams of the other Bethlehem parents? Doesn’t this event, like all the others I mentioned in my introduction, rightly prompt the question, perhaps asked with a tone of weeping and loud lamentation: <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”?</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="b-the-fulfillment-1"><strong>B. THE FULFILLMENT</strong></h3>
<p>This passage sticks with me partially because my wife’s name is Rachel. She has wept, as a nurse, over the often senseless suffering of her patients. And she is not alone. Matthew draws our attention to Jeremiah 31:15, depicting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel">Rachel</a> – the wife of Jacob, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin – as weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are no more. <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”</strong></em></p>
<p>The original context of this passage is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity">the Babylonian invasion and exile</a> of the people of Judah. Ramah, just 5 miles north of Jerusalem, was where the exiles were assembled in 586 B.C. for the journey into Babylon.</p>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah witnessed Jerusalem destroyed and its inhabitants terrorized. He poetically depicts Rachel, the Old Testament’s paradigmatic and idealized mother of the people of Israel, as weeping for her children as they go into exile.</p>
<p>Imagine Eve, the mother of the living, weeping as she looks forward from the past to see all the horrible effects of the exile from Eden, and you’ll get a similar idea.</p>

</p>
<p>The connection is HOPE.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 31:15, although tragic, occurs in a hopeful section of the book. In fact, the chapter of Jeremiah 31 is best known for its depiction in vv.31–40 of the New Covenant! The quoted verse about Rachel weeping is followed by these two verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus says the Lord:</p>
<p>“ Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work, declares the Lord, and they shall come back from the land of the enemy.</p>
<p>There is hope for your future, declares the Lord, and your children shall come back to their own country.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rachel was weeping over the exile.And she is promised that it will one day end.The exiles will return – as they began to do,48 years later, in 538 BC.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that <u>this “prophecy” did not somehow cause the tragedy at Bethlehem</u>.As John Calvin notes in his Gospel commentary, because Jeremiah’s oracle had its own fulfillment regarding the exile to Babylon and the subsequent return, “Matthew does not mean that it foretold what Herod would do, but that the coming of Christ occasioned a renewal of that mourning, which had been experienced, many centuries before,” by the people of Israel.</p>
<p>Because , you’ll notice, <strong>the people of Israel were still in exile</strong>. Sure, five centuries had passed since they had physically returned, but they still lived under a foreign ruler, not a son of David, who could enter the city of David at will and have the baby boys slaughtered.</p>
<p><strong>We have an encounter between two kings in this passage</strong>. The first, a crazed old man, is the illegitimate king of the Jews – deathly afraid of pretenders to his throne. The second, a vulnerable human baby, is the legitimate king of the Jews and of the world.</p>
<p>When faced with the latter, the former should have bowed the knee – as did the wise men (who, you’ll notice, came from the exile-lands of Babylon and Persia). Instead, Herod draws the sword, and the Son of God goes into exile, a refugee in the ancient land of slavery from which his people were bought and delivered by Yahweh.</p>
<p>With the mothers of Bethlehem, Rachel was still weeping.</p>
<p>Her children were not yet home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>
<p>What do we make of this?</p>
<p>Although the Jeremiah quotation points in the direction of hope, you’ll notice that Matthew leaves it hanging on a note of lamentation.</p>
<p>Might I suggest that <strong><u>the yearly Feast of the Holy Innocents is our liturgical antidote to a merely superficial and sentimental Christmas season</u></strong>?</p>
<p>The realities of Bethlehem, of the Christian faith, and of our lives, often have more blood, sweat, and tears in them than we care to admit – more pain than our idyllic notions can contain.</p>
<p>The Incarnation is glorious, but it’s also <u>messy</u>. Because we are messy! The human race – this very room! – is filled with Herods. We may not all kill babies out of fear, but our fear does drive us toward death. Think of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do our fears – of rejection, of failure, of powerlessness – drive us to do to <em>rupture</em> our relationships with God and with our fellow humans?</li>
<li>What do our fears – of intimacy, of scarcity, of being taken advantage of – prevent us from doing to <em>foster</em> those same relationships?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sisters and brothers, we Christians cannot afford an escapist religion of mere sentimentality which is out of touch with this broken and twisted world.</p>
<h3 id="we-cannot-afford-an-escapist-religion-because-we-do-not-worship-an-escapist-god"><strong>We</strong> <strong>cannot afford an escapist religion because we do not worship an escapist God!</strong></h3>
<p>Now , remember: <strong>evil is incomprehensible</strong>. It is the impossible possibility – a headlong dive, away from the source of Life and Light, into the arms of nothingness and darkness. <strong>It</strong> <strong>makes no sense!</strong></p>
<p>Therefore , some neat and tidy “answers” to the problem of evil can themselves be evil – by trying to explain that which cannot be explained!</p>
<p>Don’t offer or seek such “answers.” It’s better to remain silent, or to cry out <em><strong>“Why, God? Why?!”</strong></em> Job did. Jesus did.</p>
<p>JESUS DID…on the Cross!</p>
<h3 id="evil-cannot-and-should-not-be-explained-but-it-can-has-been-and-will-be-defeated"><strong>Evil cannot and should not be explained. But it can, has been, and will be defeated!</strong></h3>
<p>Although it does not lessen the tragedy, King Jesus, the commander of heaven’s armies, did not abandon these baby boys, his very first standard-bearers, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Chrysologus">Peter Chrysologus</a> noted. Instead, he sent them on ahead of himself into victory.</p>
<p>Although it does not lessen the tragedies we face, our God does not escape evil and suffering at our expense.</p>
<p>Sure , he escaped Herod once…in order to make it to the <u>Cross</u>,where he took Sin and Death to their bitter end in our stead.</p>
<p>He went into the furthest and fullest exile – the grave –in order to bring us back from our exile.</p>
<p>This return will look a bit different from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Zion">return</a> in 538 BC, for it will be full and final.</p>
<p>As our <a href="http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearABC/HolyDays/HolyInno.html#EPISTLE">second lesson</a> today describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.</p>
<p>He will dwell with us, and we will be his people, and God himself will be with us as our God.</p>
<p>He will wipe away every tear from our eyes, from the eyes of Bethlehem’s mothers and from the eyes of Bethlehem’s babies.</p>
<p>And death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God, the Alpha and the Omega, whose justice and mercy far outstrip our own, will make all things new.</p>
<p><strong>God will be our God.</strong></p>
<p>And because of His Son – who joined us in our distant depths, and went into exile in our stead to bring us home – <strong>We will be God’s daughters and sons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

      <title>The Brokenhearted God</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not to take away from the undeniably biblical teaching that God is almighty, but sometimes I think &lt;strong&gt;we lose sight of God&amp;rsquo;s love for his image-bearers when we emphasize certain &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; portraits of God at the expense of (instead of alongside of) other &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; portraits found in Scripture&lt;/strong&gt;. (I put &amp;ldquo;strong&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;weak&amp;rdquo; in quotes because perhaps our definitions of strength and weakness therefore need to change!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might make some of us uncomfortable to read about God portrayed as a jilted lover or a frustrated mother, but those portraits just might be desperately needed in a time when so many people turn away from God because they can&amp;rsquo;t understand how he can possibly be the good Lord of a world so broken and dying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(I put &ldquo;strong&rdquo; and &ldquo;weak&rdquo; in quotes because perhaps our definitions of strength and weakness therefore need to change!)</p>
<p>It might make some of us uncomfortable to read about God portrayed as a jilted lover or a frustrated mother, but those portraits just might be desperately needed in a time when so many people turn away from God because they can&rsquo;t understand how he can possibly be the good Lord of a world so broken and dying.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not let our emphasis on God as King make him seem like a distant despot, or something dangerously close to the author of evil. We worship a God who is immanent in his transcendence, and we don&rsquo;t all need to become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_theology">process theologians</a> to recognize this. Perhaps we just need to read the prophets! Consider the following two examples:</p>
<p><em><strong>When Israel was a child, I loved him,</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>and out of Egypt I called my son.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>The more I called them,</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>the further they went from me;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>they kept sacrificing to the Baals,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>and they burned incense to idols.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>I took them up in my arms,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>but they did not know that I healed them.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>I led them</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>with bands of human kindness,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>with cords of love.</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>I treated them like those</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>who lift infants to their cheeks;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>I bent down to them and fed them.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>…</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I won’t act on the heat of my anger;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>I won’t return to destroy Ephraim;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>for I am God and not a human being,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>the holy one in your midst;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>I won’t come in harsh judgment.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>They will walk after the</strong></em><em>Lord</em>***,***</p>
<p><strong>who roars like a lion.</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>When he roars,</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>his children will come trembling from the west.</strong>*</p>
<p><em><strong>They will come trembling like a bird,</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>and like a dove from the land of Assyria;</strong>*</p>
<p><strong>and I will return them to their homes, says the<strong><strong>Lord</strong></strong>.</strong>* (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+11&amp;amp;version=CEB">Hosea 11:1-4; 9-11, CEB</a>)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>***As for your birth, on the day you were born your umbilical cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water; you were certainly not rubbed down with salt, nor wrapped with blankets.*<em><strong>No eye took pity on you to do even one of these things for you to spare you; you were thrown out into the open field because you were detested on the day you were born.</strong></em></p>
<p>***“‘I passed by you and saw you kicking around helplessly in your blood. I said to you as you lay there in your blood, “Live!” I said to you as you lay there in your blood, “Live!”*<em><strong>I made you plentiful like sprouts in a field; you grew tall and came of age so that you could wear jewelry. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, but you were still naked and bare.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“‘Then I passed by you and watched you, noticing that you had reached the age for love. I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness. I swore a solemn oath to you and entered into a marriage covenant with you, declares the sovereign</strong></em><em>Lord</em>***, and you became mine.***</p>
<p>***“‘Then I bathed you in water, washed the blood off you, and anointed you with fragrant oil.****I dressed you in embroidered clothing and put fine leather sandals on your feet. I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.****I adorned you with jewelry. I put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck.*<em><strong>I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.<strong><strong>You were adorned with gold and silver, while your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidery. You ate the finest flour, honey, and olive oil. You became extremely beautiful and attained the position of royalty.<strong><strong>Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty; your beauty was perfect because of the splendor which I bestowed on you, declares the sovereign</strong></strong>Lord</strong></strong>.</strong></em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2016&amp;amp;version=NET">Ezekiel 16:4-14, NET</a>)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Notice that God&rsquo;s immanence, his willingness to suffer alongside us (and in our stead, through Christ), doesn&rsquo;t negate his hatred for sin. Instead, I&rsquo;d argue that <strong>God&rsquo;s immanence intensifies his negative reaction to Sin and Death as his cosmic enemies!</strong> Emmanuel, God with us, sees our sickness for what it truly is. It&rsquo;s not something to be trifled with, and it doesn&rsquo;t just upset God because it &ldquo;breaks his list of rules.&rdquo; No, sin breaks God&rsquo;s good creation. It is a cancer which kills from within, even dragging his precious image bearers down to the grave…blinding them to the horrible reality of their downfall, and enticing them, enticing US with phantoms of fleeting pleasure.</p>
<p>This rambling post was inspired by the following two songs, which capture the above ideas beautifully. The first is <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/4xyARNLYUCYc0HubY88IX8">&ldquo;Ezekiel,&rdquo; by Gungor</a>, based on the text of Ezekiel 16. The second is <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/78BUC2TstlFmGvI1pvNhTT">&ldquo;Not Your Type&rdquo; by Noah James</a>. Give both a listen if you have the time!</p>

      <title>My Uncle, Timothy Steele</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/20150424my-uncle-timothy-steele/</link>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/20150424my-uncle-timothy-steele/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(This post is about my late uncle, Timothy Steele. It’s long, and I swear toward the end. Sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is better to go to a funeral than a feast. For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart. Sorrow is better than laughter, because sober reflection is good for the heart.” (Ecclesiastes 7:2-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timothy-steele&#34;&gt;Timothy Steele&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition is staggering. The funeral of the man I most associate with laughter and joy. It hurts. No Steele family gathering was complete without hearing his boisterous laugh, receiving one of his legendary bear hugs, and – if you were lucky – getting one heck of a sloppy kiss on the cheek.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="timothy-steele">Timothy Steele</h2>
<p>The juxtaposition is staggering. The funeral of the man I most associate with laughter and joy. It hurts. No Steele family gathering was complete without hearing his boisterous laugh, receiving one of his legendary bear hugs, and – if you were lucky – getting one heck of a sloppy kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>His greetings were the most genuine. I always knew when Uncle Tim had arrived. And whenever I arrived, he made me feel like my presence mattered, like he had missed me, like he was proud of me.</p>
<p>My Uncle Tim was one of the first people in the room to hold me when I was born. Although I can’t remember it, <em>he was there on the very first day of my life</em>. Growing up, his house was always a welcome place to hang out with my cousins. He was like a second dad, and his children like a second set of siblings.</p>
<p>Speaking of dad, my Uncle Tim was used by God to help my dad out of his habits and addictions and into an encounter with Jesus Christ. At the funeral, my dad spoke of it in terms of Tim saving him from drowning. <strong>I will perhaps never know how much in my life I owe to my Uncle Tim being there for his younger brother, Patrick, putting his reputation on the line to guide and love my dad toward Christ</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, it meant a lot to me that my Uncle Tim made it out to my wedding in Pennsylvania in August 2012. Whenever my wife and I watch our wedding video, one of our favorite parts is when Uncle Tim’s voice booms out from the back of the church after we finished our duet of <em>Be Thou My Vision</em>. Amidst the applause, he cries out in a weepy voice: <em><strong>“That was beautiful!!!”</strong></em> He is intertwined with the memories of one of the happiest days of my life.</p>
<p>Many more stories could be and have been told about Timothy Steele. However, there’s one memory in particular that I haven’t been able to get out of my head these past days since hearing of my uncle’s untimely death. It happened in the garage of Grandma Steele’s house during a family gathering when her health was declining, if I remember correctly. Amidst the normal hilarious and loud stories, the conversation took a serious turn, and my Uncle Tim spoke of the pain he felt when he looked back upon times in his life when he had turned his back on Jesus, so to speak.</p>
<p>Now, he didn’t speak of his regrets in terms of not knowing any better when he was younger. He didn’t speak of the pain of violating a general sense of right and wrong, but of the nagging sense that at various times he had let a <strong>person</strong> down…the person of Christ.</p>
<h2 id="encouragement-in-the-midst-of-pain">Encouragement in the Midst of Pain</h2>
<p>Here’s why I find that story encouraging in the midst of pain: <strong>You don’t much regret letting down people for whom you don’t much care. And even though we have all, to the very last one of us, let Jesus down, he never abandons us. His love makes my Uncle Tim’s love pale in comparison, and he is now showing Tim even more grace than Tim showed to all of us each day.</strong></p>
<p>If you ever met my Uncle Tim, you know of his gracious love toward every single person he met. These past few days have been filled with stories about this man who was a force of nature, always ready to extend his gregarious love toward even, if not especially, “discarded and used-up people,” as my cousin Whitney put it. And as my Uncle John put it, “<em><strong>Tim loved you like Jesus does.</strong></em>”</p>
<p>I was struck by viewing those loving, gracious memories of my Uncle Tim in light of the relationship revealed to me in that serious conversation in the garage. That is, to realize that my Uncle Tim was such a uniquely loving person, not just because he thought it was a good idea or because he just had so much love on his own, but because of the love he had received from Christ. To realize that <u>the intense love which characterized every personal encounter with my Uncle flowed from the intense love he had first and continually experienced in his personal encounter with the crucified-and-risen Jesus Christ</u>.</p>
<p>Unlike many, my Uncle Tim understood that the Gospel of Christ doesn’t just make a difference in the “afterlife,” but that it makes a difference in the here-and-now! That <em><strong>if knowing Christ makes no difference in how you treat the flesh-and-blood people around you who are made in God’s image, then you probably don’t know Christ</strong></em>. The eternal life spoken of in the Gospel doesn’t begin the day you die, it began the day Christ died and rose from the grave.</p>
<p>I often worry that Christian pronouncements about the good news of Jesus Christ strike others as hollow, fake, and escapist – especially in the context of a funeral. How can trite truisms about Jesus be relevant in the midst of so much pain?</p>
<p>But my Uncle Tim’s life on earth, painful ending and all, was not a trite truism. You know if you knew Timothy Steele. He demonstrated what <em><strong>faith</strong></em> looks like — that it has to do with more than just thinking the right things, more than just following a list of rules — it has to do with <u>a faithful relationship to a PERSON, a relationship which then changes the way you treat PEOPLE</u>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclude-and-reflect">Conclude and Reflect</h2>
<p>I write this reflection mid-air, on my way back to Alabama. I wish that I had gotten to see my family members in a house of merrymaking, but it was a house of mourning instead.As we remembered the life of the man who could make you laugh so hard you cried, there was a lot of laughter and a lot of tears in the Steele family this weekend. There was riotous applause at the funeral at one point, but I know there’s still a whole lot of sadness and pain.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this and you, like me, are privileged to have known Timothy Steele, would you reflect on the connection between the love this man showed to all and the love of Christ which he had first received? When you seek hope in the midst of your reasonable sorrow, and you spend time dwelling on happy memories of the man, would you consider that the source of all that gracious love wasn’t a general sense, it wasn’t an impersonal force…<u>it was my Uncle Tim’s encounter and relationship with a person</u>.</p>
<p>And if you’re reading this and your pain feels too great for all this Jesus talk at the moment, if, like me, you experienced a big dose of anger at the side of Tim’s casket this weekend…that God would allow this life to end so soon…that this world is still broken and infected by Death, would you please join me in clinging to the hope that <u>God hates death even more than we do</u>?</p>
<p>Sometimes it doesn’t feel like it, but seriously, he does. For all the hopeful Christian talk at funerals, we can never forget that Death <em>sucks</em>.</p>
<p>No, that’s not strong enough. <em><strong>Death is fucking horrible</strong></em>. And I hope you agree that I say that out of concern for accuracy, and not merely vulgarity.Death’s final defeat has been declared at the empty tomb of Jesus Christ, butdammit, we’re still waiting for the final removal of Death’s presence from this world. It’s not our annoying, normal friend. It’s our alien enemy. And I don’t know about you, but when Death strikes close to my door, when it hits the ones I love, I want to <strong>rage</strong> against it with all I have.</p>
<p><strong>God rages against Death. He dove headfirst into the depths of this world, into the realm of the discarded and the used-up, the dead and the dying. He himself dove into the very grave, that he might emerge from it victorious. That he might lay Death itself in its cold grave, that he might silence the bastard enemy of the children of God.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t just follow Jesus to get into heaven someday when I die. I follow him because he hates Death more than I do, because in an important sense he is more heartbroken than I am over the death of my Uncle and the sorrow of the family members he left behind. And because, amazingly enough, he invites me and his people — he invites YOU — to join him in the mission of eternal life, to join him in the process of putting Death to death in our daily lives, in the world around us.</p>
<p>And, following the words of my beloved Uncle Tim, <em><strong>that’s beautiful</strong></em>.</p>
<p>(For another reflection on death, hope, and resurrection, read <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/03/29/son-of-man-can-your-bones-live/">my sermon: “Son of Man, Can Your Bones Live?”</a>)</p>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/give-thanks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not the most thankful person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am a follower of Jesus, and one of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning this semester is that &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;praise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thanksgiving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gratitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt; are closely intertwined. Worship should involve the public proclamation of who God is and what He has done — including specific, personal declarations of thanksgiving for God&amp;rsquo;s grace and good gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you have a hard time cultivating this worshipful practice of gratitude, then allow me to suggest the following prayers from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bcponline.org/&#34;&gt;Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt; to help get us started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not the most thankful person.</p>
<p>However, I am a follower of Jesus, and one of the lessons I&rsquo;ve been learning this semester is that <u><strong>praise</strong></u>, <u><strong>thanksgiving</strong></u>, and <u><strong>gratitude</strong></u> are closely intertwined. Worship should involve the public proclamation of who God is and what He has done — including specific, personal declarations of thanksgiving for God&rsquo;s grace and good gifts.</p>
<p>If, like me, you have a hard time cultivating this worshipful practice of gratitude, then allow me to suggest the following prayers from the <a href="http://www.bcponline.org/">Book of Common Prayer</a> to help get us started.</p>
<p>The first one is the simplest: a prayer for <u><strong>Grace at Meals</strong></u>. Perhaps this is an easily-overlooked truth, but <u>we can ask God for grateful hearts</u>! That is, instead of merely asking him for things…for which we will hopefully then be grateful… we can ask him for help in <strong>becoming grateful people</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Give us grateful hearts, our Father, for all Your mercies, and make us mindful of the needs of others; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em>&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If you have time for more than just the 25-word prayer above, consider using the following prayers as a springboard for a time of gathering together as a family to give thanks to God. The General Thanksgiving is said by Anglicans during daily prayer throughout the year. Consider praying through this together as a family or group of friends.</p>
<p><u><strong>The General Thanksgiving:</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks for all your goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all whom you have made. We bless you for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; but above all for your immeasurable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory. And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies, that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our selves to your service, and by walking before you in holiness and righteousness all our days; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, be honor and glory throughout all ages.</strong> <em><strong>Amen</strong></em>**.&rdquo;**</p>
<p>Finally, this Litany of Thanksgiving is a bit longer, but consider pausing after each segment to think on all the good gifts God gives to us in each area of life. If you, like me, have a hard time thinking of things to be thankful for, allow this time of prayer to jog your memory.</p>
<p><u><strong>A Litany of Thanksgiving:</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Let us give thanks to God our Father for all his gifts so freely bestowed upon us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the beauty and wonder of your creation, in earth and sky and sea.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For all that is gracious in the lives of men and women, revealing the image of Christ,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For our daily food and drink, our homes and families, and our friends,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For minds to think, and hearts to love, and hands to serve,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For health and strength to work, and leisure to rest and play,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For the brave and courageous, who are patient in suffering and faithful in adversity,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For all valiant seekers after truth, liberty, and justice,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>For the communion of saints, in all times and places,</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>We thank you, Lord.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Above all, we give you thanks for the great mercies and promises given to us in Christ Jesus our Lord;</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>To him be praise and glory, with you, O Father, and the</strong> <strong>Holy Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.</strong></em></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>What are you thankful for?</p>

<p><a href="http://postbarthian.com/2013/07/17/karl-barth-on-the-temptation-of-jesus-in-the-wilderness/"></a></p>
<p>The following series of quotations comes from a lengthy small-print section in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Dogmatics">CD</a> <a href="http://www.foundationrt.org/outlines/Barth_Dogmatics_Volume_IV.pdf">IV</a>/1, 259-73 <em>(<span style="font-family:&background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">§ 59 The Obedience of the Son of God; 2. The Judge Judged in Our Place)</span></em>. There Barth walks through the three wilderness temptations before masterfully connecting them to Christ&rsquo;s experience in the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<p>On page 261, the discussion of the temptations begins:</p>
<p><strong><u>The First Temptation: Stones into Bread (CD IV/1, 261-2)</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Garamond">&ldquo;In both Evangelists [<em>Matthew and Luke</em>] the first Satanic suggestion is that after the forty days of hunger He should change the stones of the wilderness into bread in the power of His divine Sonship by His Word.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<p><font face="Garamond">For Barth, it is important that Christ is not tempted in the wilderness to any sort of moral violations of the Law. Instead, he is tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For this is the form and content of Jesus&rsquo; sinlessness — not a vague moral perfection, but specifically his obedience and repentance.</font></p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Garamond">&ldquo;What would it have meant if Jesus had yielded? <u>He would have used the power of God which He undoubtedly had like a technical instrument placed at His disposal to save and maintain His own life. He would then have stepped out of the series of sinners in which He placed Himself in His baptism in Jordan. Of His own will He would have abandoned the role of the One who fasts and repents for sinners. He would have broken off His fasting and repentance in the fulness of divine power and with the help of God, but without consulting the will and commandment of God, because in the last resort His primary will was to live. He would have refused to give Himself unreservedly to be the one great sinner who allows that God is in the right, to set His hopes for the redemption and maintenance of His life only on the Word of God, in the establishment of which He was engaged in this self-offering.</u> He would have refused to be willing to live only by this Word and promise of God, and therefore to continue to hunger.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<p><font face="Garamond">From a &ldquo;human&rdquo; standpoint, however, choosing self-preservation over starvation makes perfect sense!</font></p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Garamond">&ldquo;In so doing He would, of course, only have done what in His place and with His powers all other men would certainly have done. <u>From the standpoint of all other men He would only have acted reasonably and rightly</u>. &ldquo;Rabbi, eat&rdquo; is what His disciples later said to Him (Jn. 4<sup>31</sup>) quite reasonably and in all innocence. But then He would not have made it His meat &ldquo;to do the will of him that sent him, and to</font><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">finish his work&rdquo; (Jn. 4</span><sup style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">34</sup><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">  
</span>
<p><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">However, Christ the God-Human is more human and less sinful than us in his refusal to abandon obedience and repentance. For this reason, his repentance was perfect — a repentance unto redemption.</span></p>
<span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">&quot;<u>Instead of acting for all other men and in their place, He would have left them in the lurch at the very moment when He had made their cause His own. Jesus withstood this temptation. He persisted in obedience, in penitence, in fasting</u>. He hungered in confidence in the promise of manna with which the same God had once fed the fathers in the wilderness after He had allowed them to hunger (Deut. 8</span><sup style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">3</sup><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">). <u>He willed to live only by that which the Word of God creates, and therefore as one of the sinners who have no hope apart from God, as the Head and King of this people. His decision was, therefore, a different one from that which all other men would have taken in His place, and in that way it was the righteousness which He achieved in their stead</u>.&quot;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">  
</span>
<p><span style="line-height:19.200000762939px;">Stay tuned for Karl Barth&rsquo;s exegesis of the second temptation, for Christ to fall down and worship Satan.</span></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just received the news today that my student paper submission for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lru.hobsonsradius.com/ssc/eform/N70x7m7aEx6G0x67128L.ssc&#34;&gt;2015 Southeast Regional Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society&lt;/a&gt; has been accepted!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just received the news today that my student paper submission for the <a href="https://lru.hobsonsradius.com/ssc/eform/N70x7m7aEx6G0x67128L.ssc">2015 Southeast Regional Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society</a> has been accepted!</p>
<p>My theme lately has been to write on <u>Karl Barth and the unity of the Church</u>. At last year&rsquo;s Regional ETS (hosted by my seminary, <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>), I presented an edited version of my undergraduate thesis: <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/steele-southeast-ets-2014-paper-final-presesntation-edit.pdf">Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof: Atonement, Ecclesiology, and the Unity of God</a>. Click the link if you&rsquo;d like to read the PDF. Here&rsquo;s the thesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;This essay endeavors to demonstrate the theological and exegetical legitimacy of viewing <u>the atonement as the act in which the one God fulfills his creative purposes by bringing his uniqueness and simplicity to bear on our sinful, divisive condition through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah in order to save a people to robust unity with himself, each other, and the entire creation</u>.&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That paper was a blast to write, because I got to take the doctoral work of my professor (and friend) <a href="http://academics.biola.edu/torrey/about/people/faculty/adam-johnson/">Adam J. Johnson</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Being-Reconciliation-Theological-Systematic/dp/0567123456">God&rsquo;s Being in Reconciliation: The Theological Basis of the Unity and Diversity of the Atonement in the Theology of Karl Barth</a>, now available in paperback!) and &ldquo;build&rdquo; an atonement theory based upon the divine perfection of oneness/unity. I hope to expand on that work, drawing upon other theologians than Johnson and Barth, expanding my exegetical arguments for the atonement theory&rsquo;s legitimacy, considering practical implications for ecumenical efforts, etc.</p>
<p>This year, I have submitted a slightly edited version of my final paper fora seminar on the Theology of Karl Barth taught by Piotr Malysz last Fall at Beeson. The Barthian analogy is taking Barth&rsquo;s definition of sin as ontological impossibility — the impossible possibility — and transferring it to thought and speech about the Church. It&rsquo;s a relatively simple idea, with profound ramifications (in my humble opinion) for ecumenical efforts. Here&rsquo;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Just as sin is ontological impossibility, disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. The tension between the undeniable reality of sin and Karl Barth’s theological definition of sin as an impossible possibility parallels the tension between the obvious reality of a fractured church and the theological definition of the church as the one body of the one Christ. <u>In order to describe in Barthian terms what it means for church disunity to be possible only as sin is possible, the purpose of this paper is to correlate Barth’s anthropological concept of sin as ontological impossibility with its parallel ecclesiological concept: disunity as ecclesiological impossibility</u>. I then conclude by locating this discussion within Barth’s own ecumenical vision – with an eye toward informing and motivating further ecumenical efforts.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this is an important topic to discuss because, as I put it, &ldquo;<em><strong>each community’s self-examination and pursuit of Christ’s unifying summons will only be as rigorous as its understanding of the absurdity of church fragmentation.</strong></em>&rdquo; That is, we&rsquo;re only going to put effort into being unified as Christ&rsquo;s Church if we have a robust understanding of just how ABSURD division is within the Body of Christ!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in this topic, but you can&rsquo;t make it to Lithonia, GA on March 27-28, feel free to read my paper here:</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">Yesterday I posted the beginning of Karl Barth&rsquo;s exegesis of Christ&rsquo;s wilderness temptations</a>. He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus&rsquo; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">first temptation was to turn stones into bread</a>, thereby using divine power as a &ldquo;technical instrument&rdquo; to save and maintain his own life. Today&rsquo;s temptation contains an incisive critique of Christendom&rsquo;s desire for influence, relevance, and power.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Second Temptation: Christendom&rsquo;s Cost — Worship Satan (CD IV/1, 262)</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;According to Luke, the second Satanic suggestion is that <u>Satan, to whom the world belongs, should give him lordship over it, at the price of His falling down and worshipping him</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barth gets right to the point, interpreting this temptation. Notice again the theme of abandoning repentance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What would it have meant if Jesus had done this?Obviously <u>He would have shown that He repented having received the baptism of John and that He did not intend to complete the penitence which He had begun</u>. <u>He would have ceased to recognise and confess the sin of the world as sin, to take it upon Himself as such, and in His own person to bring to an issue the conflict with it (as with man&rsquo;s contradiction against God and himself)</u>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terrible, right? But consider how pragmatism rears its ugly head!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He would have won through and been converted to a <u>simpler</u> and more <u>practical</u> and more <u>realistic</u> approach and way. He would have determined to drop the question of the overcoming and removing of evil, <u>to accept the undeniable fact of the overlordship of evil in the world</u>, and to do good, even the best, on this indisputable presupposition, on the ground and in the sphere of this overlordship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so even then, the phrase &ldquo;undeniable overlordship of evil&rdquo; sounds quite nasty. But Barth is driving home an incisive critique of Christendom — the unholy marriage between the Kingdom of God and the kingdoms of humanity and the Devil.</p>
<p>The following question is haunting. I am particularly struck by the inclusion of the word &ldquo;ecumenical.&rdquo; If we are not careful, isn&rsquo;t this almost exactly what many Christians desire? How far are we willing to go to obtain influence and power?</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div><div>"<u>Why not set up a real kingdom of God on earth? an international order modelled on the insights of Christian humanitarianism, in which, of course, a liberal-orthodox, ecumenical, confessional Church might also find an appropriate place?</u></div><div></div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>And we can still fall prey to this temptation, without completely giving up our God! Just worship God and bow the knee, even secretly, to Satan. Sure, you can still be pious. Just achieve your piety&rsquo;s ends through the gears and cogs of the world-machine! You want to be relevant? Hitch your goals to a movement, a political party, a military!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div></div><div>"Note that to do this <u>He was not asked to renounce God or to go over to atheism</u>. <u>He had only to lift His hat to the usurper. He had only to bow the knee discreetly and privately to the devil</u>. He had only to make the quiet but solid and irreversible acknowledgment that <u>in that world of splendour the devil should have the first and final word, that at bottom everything should remain as it had been</u>.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div><div>However, Barth's point is that, in doing so, Christ would have completely given up the redemptive mission. We must take heed, especially in our ostensibly "Christian" nation (according to some in the US, at least), lest we do the same.</div><div></div>> <div>"On this condition <u>we can all succeed in the world, and Jesus most of all</u>. In the divine and human kingdom set up on this condition <u>there would have been no place for the cross</u>. Or rather, <u>in this world ostensibly ruled by Jesus but secretly by Satan, the cross would have been harmlessly turned into a fine and profound symbol: an ornament in the official philosophy and outlook; but also an adornment (e.g., an episcopal adornment) in the more usual sense of the word; a suitable recollection of that which Jesus avoided and which is not therefore necessary for anyone else</u>.</div>
<div></div><div>Christ succeeded at this point where every other human would have failed.</div><div></div>> <div>"<u>What other man in Jesus' place would not have been clever enough to close with this offer?</u> But what He had to do and willed to do in place of all would not then have been done. <u>He would again have left them in the lurch and betrayed them, in spite of all the fine and good things that the world-kingdom of Satan and Jesus might have meant for them</u>.</div>
<div></div><div>Attractive realism vs. repentance and obedience. Will we take Christ's example and Barth's critique to heart, as the Church constantly faces the temptation to give allegiance to the powers, empires, and corporations of this world?</div><div></div>> <div>"<u>For of what advantage is even the greatest glory to a world which is still definitively unreconciled with God</u>? Of what gain to man are all the conceivable advantages and advances of such a kingdom? But Jesus resisted this temptation too. He refused to be won over to this <u>attractive realism</u>. <u>As the one great sinner in the name and place of all others, without any prospect of this glory, quite unsuccessfully, indeed with the certainty of failure, He willed to continue worshipping and serving God alone. He willed to persist in repentance and obedience. This was the righteousness which He achieved for us</u>."</div><div></div>
<p>Stay tuned for tomorrow&rsquo;s temptation, which Barth considers the most astonishing: &ldquo;<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19px;text-align:left;">to commit an act of supreme, unconditional, blind, absolute, total confidence in God-as was obviously supremely fitting for the Son of God.&quot;</span></p>

&lt;p&gt;It is a particularly appropriate discussion for this season of&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent&#34;&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;, for Jesus was not tempted to break the Law or commit a moral infraction.

<p>In response to the<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">first temptation, to turn stones into bread</a>, Christ refused to use divine power as a &ldquo;technical instrument&rdquo; to preserve his own life. In response to the <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-2-christendoms-cost-worship-satan">second temptation, to worship Satan in exchange for authority and power</a>, Christ refused to sell redemption short by establishing a Christendom &ldquo;ostensibly ruled by Jesus but secretly by Satan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which brings us to today&rsquo;s discussion:</p>
<p><strong><u><br>
</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>The Third Temptation: The Leap of False Faith (CD IV/1, 262-4)</u></strong></p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<p><font face="Garamond">Barth begins by noting the climactic, surprising nature of this third temptation, given the temple setting and Satan&rsquo;s use of Scripture:</font></p>
<font face="Garamond">  
</font>
<blockquote>
<div><font face="Garamond">"The third temptation, according to Luke's account, is the most astonishing of all. The dignity of the setting, the temple of God in the holy city of Jerusalem, is obviously incomparably greater than the still secular dignity of that high mountain from which Jesus was shown and offered all the kingdoms of the world. It is of a piece that Satan now appears as an obviously pious man who</font></div><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">can even quote the Psalms of David, and he gains in the seriousness and weight of his approach. Above all, his suggestion-we can hardly describe it by the horrible word temptation-<u>is quite different from everything that has preceded it</u>.</span>
</blockquote>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<p><span style="line-height:19px;">The temptation at hand is different from the preceding one&rsquo;s in terms of its apparent piety! Isn&rsquo;t an act of &ldquo;total confidence in God&rdquo; appropriate for God&rsquo;s Son?</span></p>
<span style="line-height:19px;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&ldquo;It now consists in <u>the demand to commit an act of supreme, unconditional, blind, absolute, total confidence in God-as was obviously supremely fitting for the Son of God</u>. We might almost say, an act in the sense of and in line with the answers which Jesus Himself had given to the first two temptations, <u>to live only by the Word of God, to serve and worship Him alone</u>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">Indeed, it doesn&rsquo;t take much imagination to see the connection between Jesus&rsquo; response to the first two temptations and what he is asked to do here. However, Barth points out that this is not designed to be a miraculous demonstration of Jesus&rsquo; Messianic identity. Instead, it something even more nefarious:</span></p>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&ldquo;In the last decades we have become accustomed to think of the seeking and attaining of <u>totalitarian dominion as the worst of all evils, as that which is specifically demonic</u>. But if the climax in Luke is right, <u>there is something even worse and just as demonic</u>. It is <u>not</u> just a matter of <u>a miraculous display to reveal the Messiahship of Jesus</u>. It is often interpreted in this way, but by a reading into the text rather than out of it. The text itself makes no mention whatever of spectators. It is rather a question of <u>the testing and proving, of the final assuring of His relationship to God<em>in foro conscientiae</em></u></span><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;"><u>, in the solitariness of man with God</u>. Jesus is to risk this headlong plunge with the certainty, and to <u>confirm the certainty, that God and His angels are with Him and will keep Him</u>.</span></p>

<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">Christ is asked to affirm, to certify on his own terms, the relationship between him and God. Barth then uses Schlatter to demonstrate the connections between this temptation and some familiar theological concepts:</span></p>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&ldquo;Schlatter has rather mischievously said that what we have here is what is so glibly described &ldquo;in contemporary theological literature&rdquo; as <u>the &ldquo;leap&rdquo; of faith</u>. It certainly does seem to be something very like &ldquo;existence in transcendence,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the leap into the unknown,&rdquo; or in Reformation language &ldquo;<u>justification by faith alone</u>,&rdquo; <u>justification in the sense that</u> (in face of death and the last judgment, and in the hope that in trust in God these can be overcome) <u>man presumes to take it into his own hands, to carry it through as the work of his own robust faith, and in that way to have a part in it and to be certain of it</u>; just as Empedocles (we do not know exactly why, but seriously and with courage) finally flung himself into the smoking crater of Etna, which is supposed to have thrown out again only his sandals; just as on this very same rock of the temple, when it was stormed by the Romans in A.D. 70, the last of the high priests put themselves to death with their own hands, possibly in despair, possibly in the hope that there would be a supreme miracle at that last hour.</span></p>

</span>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">Such faith ceases to be true faith. The grasp for certainty destroys it from the inside out. And yet, because Christ will eventually take something similar to this leap of faith, Barth interprets it further:</span></p>
<p><span style="

</span>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">Notice the return of <strong>penitence</strong> as a theme, which is contrasted against a desire to turn faith in on itself, to experiment with God by demanding his acceptance of an apparently robust faith/piety:</span></p>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">

He would have demanded that <u>He should be the most false of all false gods, the god of the religious man</u>. And in so doing He would Himself have <u>withdrawn from the society of sinful men as whose Representative and Head He was ordained to live and act.

<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&ldquo;Look how strong my faith is, God!&rdquo; What religious human being would not have taken this leap of false faith in Christ&rsquo;s place? Barth pulls no punches in unveiling the subtle power-plays against God often at work in the religious enterprise:</span></p>
<span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">  
</span>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">&quot;<u>But again we may ask, what other man, all things considered, would not actually have done this in His place?</u> For Adamic man reaches his supreme form in <u>religious self-sacrifice as the most perfect kind of self-glorification, in which God</u></span> <span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;"><u>is in fact most completely impressed into the service of man, in which He is most completely denied under cover of the most complete acknowledgment of God and one&rsquo;s fellows</u>.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:19px;">Precisely in this way, Christ is unique. He is sinless in his repentance and obedience:<br>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);line-height:19.200000762939px;text-align:left;">This is not the way we usually interpret the righteousness of God at work in the wilderness temptations!

This is unavoidable, because we have to do with it <u>in the wilderness, in the kingdom of demons, in the world unreconciled with God, and in conflict with that world</u>. It is unavoidable because <u>what we have here is a prefiguring of the passion</u>. But in the passion, and in this prefiguring of it, <u><strong><font color="#FF0000">the No of God is only the hard shell of the divine Yes</font></strong>, which in both cases is spoken in the righteous act of this one man</u>. That this is the case is revealed at the conclusion of the accounts in Mark and Matthew by <u>the mention of the angels who, when Satan had left Him, came and ministered unto Him</u>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For my 20th Century History &amp; Doctrine course at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>, I&rsquo;m re-reading through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth">Karl Barth</a>&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evangelical-Theology-Introduction-Karl-Barth/dp/0802818196">Evangelical Theology: An Introduction</a></em>. If you&rsquo;re involved in the life and ministry of the Church in any respect, I strongly recommend that you buy and read this book!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a particularly challenging portion from the chapter on &ldquo;Wonder,&rdquo; beginning on page 71. I wish the language were gender-inclusive, but Karl&rsquo;s words still ring true:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;After all, <u>who am I to be a theologian?</u></p>
<p>It does not matter whether I am the best child of the best parents, perhaps having known, like Timothy ( II Tim. 3:15), about the Holy Scriptures from the very time I began to think. It does not matter whether I have the cleverest mind or the most upright heart or the very best of intentions. <u>Who am I to have put such trust in myself as to devote myself even remotely to the task of theology</u>? Who am I to co-operate in this subject, at least potentially and perhaps quite actively, as a minor researcher, thinker, or teacher? Who am I to take up the quest for truth in the service and in the sense of the community, and to take pains to complete this quest?</p>
<p>I have put such trust in myself as soon as I touch theology with even my little finger, not to speak of occupying myself with it more or less energetically or perhaps even professionally. And if I have done that, I have without fail become concerned with <u>the new event and the miracle attested to by the Bible</u>.</p>
<p>This miracle involves far <u>more</u> than just the young man at Nain or the captain of Capernaum and their companions of whom the Gospelstell; far more than the Israelites&rsquo; passage through the Red Sea, the wilderness, and the Jordan; far more than the sun that stood still upon Joshua&rsquo;s command at Gibeon. <u>I have become involved in the<em>reality of God</em>that is only signaled by all these things</u>. This is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who reveals himself in his Son through the Holy Spirit, who desired to be the God of man so that man might live as<em>his</em>man.</p>
<p><u>I have become involved in the wonder of this God, together with all its consequences for the world and for each and every man. And whatever, however, and whoever I may be in other respects, I have finally and profoundly become a man made to wonder at himself by this wonder of God</u>.</p>
<p>It is another question whether I know what self-wonderment means for me, whether I am ready and able to subordinate my bit of research, thought, and speech to the logic of this wonder (and not in reverse order!). But <u>there can be no question about one fact: I find myself confronted by the wondrous reality of the living<em>God</em>. This confrontation occurs in even the most timid and untalented attempt to take seriously the subject in which I have become involved or to work theologically at all, whether in the field of exegesis, Church history, dogmatics, or ethics</u>.&rdquo;</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is better to go to a funeral than a feast. For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following essay deals with the theme of the fear of death in <a href="http://amzn.to/2EgL3pA"><em>White Noise</em>, the novel by Don DeLillo</a> (affiliate link).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It is better to go to a funeral than a feast. For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart.<sup><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don DeLillo’s <em>White Noise</em>, “a paradigm of postmodern literature,”<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup> yields the kind of cognitive dissonance that makes you wonder whether the author simply missed the mark, or if you are only confused because you suffer from the postmodern condition which DeLillo adroitly analyzes.</p>
<p>I agree with Pico Iyer when he evaluates DeLillo as “that rarest of birds, a novelist on fire with ideas – and an outlaw epistemologist to boot – he uses his fictional excursions as occasions to think aloud in shadowed sentences, speak in modern tongues, plumb mysteries, fathom depths.”<sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></p>
<p>One such depth is the <strong>fear of death</strong>, echoing throughout the pages of <em>White Noise</em> in the perennial question: <em>who will die first?</em></p>
<p>In this essay, I endeavor to analyze the Baudrillardian concept of hyperreality as it pertains to the human fear of death, using DeLillo’s <em>White Noise</em> and the Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, India as literary and factual signposts.</p>
<h1 id="white-noisehttpamznto2egl3pa"><a href="http://amzn.to/2EgL3pA"><em><strong>White Noise</strong></em></a></h1>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2EgL3pA"><img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/White_Noise.jpg/200px-White_Noise.jpg" alt="White Noise by Don DeLillo."  />
</a></p>
<p>Jack Gladney, the novel’s protagonist, is the chairman of the department of Hitler studies at the College-on-the-Hill in a nondescript anytown called Blacksmith. He and his wife, Babette, are the heads of a hodgepodge family filled with an assortment of children from various marriages.</p>
<p>After these core details, however, it gets difficult to summarize the novel’s plot. According to Sol Yurick, this is because, “in a sense, <em>White Noise</em> doesn’t really have a plot: It is about the intrusion of a plot into life, a stringing-together of random events into some kind of meaningful schema.”<sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></p>
<p>The first twenty chapters, taking up just over one hundred pages of text, bombard the reader with an assortment of episodes. From the home, to the car, to the supermarket, to the College-on-the-Hill, an assault of misinformation and profundity fades all signals to flat – from the ever-present voice of the television to random interpolations of intense emotion.</p>
<p>We are left with white noise.</p>
<p>And yet, plot slowly invades. In Gladney’s own words: “All plots tend to move deathward. This is the nature of plots. Political plots, terrorist plots, lovers’ plots, narrative plots, plots that are part of children’s games. We edge nearer death every time we plot. It is like a contract that all must sign, the plotters as well as those who are the targets of the plot.”<sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></p>
<p>Out of the static emerges one of the novel’s central themes: the fear of death.</p>
<p>(Note: I have written elsewhere about death. See “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/son-of-man-can-your-bones-live/">Son of Man, Can Your Bones Live?</a>” and “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/20150424my-uncle-timothy-steele/">My Uncle, Timothy Steele</a>.”)</p>
<p>According to Albert Mobilio, <em>White Noise</em> explores “the narcissist’s inevitable trap: a preoccupation with dying.”<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> And DeLillo explores this theme masterfully.</p>
<p>“Writing of death,” Iyer notes, “Don DeLillo takes one’s breath away.”<sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup>The question “who will die first?” first appears in chapter four, as Jack wonders to himself whether this “thought itself is part of the nature of physical love, a reverse Darwinism that awards sadness and fear to the survivor.”<sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></p>
<p>As the novel progresses, Gladney emerges as a narcissist on a quest for meaning in order to escape death, or rather his fear of it.<sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup> According to DeLillo, “[Gladney] feels that Hitler is not only bigger than life, as we say of many famous figures, but bigger than death. Our sense of fear – we avoid it because we feel it so deeply, so there is an intense conflict at work. I brought this conflict to the surface in the shape of Jack Gladney.”<sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></p>
<p>In Derridean terms, Gladney’s search for <em>center</em>, whether in Babette’s stability, Wilder’s silence, or Hitler studies, is driven by his fear of death.</p>
<p>The same chapter closes with Jack’s admission that he is crafting an identity for himself in his Hitler studies endeavors. He wears dark lens glasses and renders his academic self J. A. K. Gladney, via the fabrication of an extra initial. By his own admission, Jack Gladney is “the false character that follows the name around.”<sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></p>
<p>In the final chapter of the book’s first section, another confession emerges:</p>
<p><em><strong>The truth is I don’t want to die first. Given a choice between loneliness and death, it would take me a fraction of a second to decide. But I don’t want to be alone either. Everything I say to Babette about holes and gaps is true. Her death would leave me scattered, talking to chairs and pillows. Don’t let us die, I want to cry out to that fifth century sky ablaze with mystery and spiral light. Let us both live forever, in sickness and in health, feebleminded, doddering, toothless, liver-spotted, dim-sighted, hallucinating. Who decides these things? What is out there? Who are you?<sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></strong></em></p>
<p>Jack Gladney wants to be somebody, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he desperately does not want to die</span>.</p>
<p>The second of three sections in <em>White Noise</em> is solely comprised of the twenty-first chapter. At fifty-four pages long, it is roughly the length of the first twelve chapters combined. This is because it is devoted to the “Airborne Toxic Event” (ATE), the novel’s main incident.</p>
<p>In brief, a noxious cloud of a chemical known as Nyodene D gets released into the atmosphere, prompting an evacuation of Blacksmith. During the evacuation process, Jack is briefly exposed to the elements (and, presumably, to the Nyodene D) while refueling the family station wagon.</p>
<p>When Jack tries to ascertain if his exposure will cause any health risks, he has a poignant conversation with one of the evacuation officials:</p>
<p><em><strong>“That’s quite an important armband you’ve got there. What does SIMUVAC mean? Sounds important.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Short for simulated evacuation. A new state program they’re still battling over funds for.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“But this evacuation isn’t simulated. It’s real.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“We know that. But we thought we could use it as a model.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“A form of practice? Are you saying you saw a chance to use the real event in order to rehearse the simulation?”<sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup></strong></em></p>
<p>The answer is yes. Unfortunately for Gladney, though, his exposure to the Nyodene D was (presumably) real enough. As his fear of death increases as a result of this news, even a specific death sentence eludes him.</p>
<p>Just as science is quickly outpacing humanity’s control (as shown by the ATE and the toxin-eating bacteria used to eat the cloud), Jack’s fear of death outpaces death itself.</p>
<p>The final section of the book is devoted to the experimental drug Dylar, which was designed to treat the fear of death. Babette eventually comes clean to Jack and admits that her intense fear of death drove her to have sex with a compromised pharmaceutical agent in order to be admitted to an unofficial Dylar study.</p>
<p>Jack is forced to come to terms with the real Babette, who is considerably less stable than he had previously believed. At first, this seems to bother him even more than the adultery. His center destabilized, his thoughts turn to Dylar, despite Babette’s insistence that the drug does not work.</p>
<p>The fear of death has morphed into an intense <em>thanatophobia</em>,[14] even more ubiquitous and intense than first thought.</p>
<p>As his efforts to obtain Dylar fail, however, Gladney’s anger at Babette’s adultery slowly grows. He cannot stop thinking about her and the unknown “Mr. Gray” getting intimate in a motel room.</p>
<p>A watershed moment for Jack comes in his lengthy conversation with Murray in chapter thirty-seven. After discussing the fear of death, hypothetical ways to transcend it (putting faith in technology, studying the afterlife, surviving a horrific accident), and Jack’s actual attempts at finding center in Hitler and even Wilder (the “noble savage” who does not know he’s going to die), the <strong>myth of redemptive violence</strong> emerges – a dangerous catalyst for Jack’s festering anger and thanatophobia.</p>
<p>Consider Murray’s words:</p>
<p><em><strong>I believe, Jack, there are two kinds of people in the world. Killers and diers. Most of us are diers. We don’t have the disposition, the rage or whatever it takes to be a killer. We let death happen. We lie down and die. But think what it’s like to be a killer. Think how exciting it is, in theory, to kill a person in direct confrontation. If he dies, you cannot. To kill him is to gain life-credit. The more people you kill, the more credit you store up. It explains any number of massacres, wars, executions.[15]</strong></em></p>
<p>Although Murray claims this is a purely theoretical conversation and Jack feigns incredulity, the idea is too tempting for Gladney to resist.</p>
<p>The second-to-last chapter of <em>White Noise</em> recounts Jack’s failed attempt to murder “Mr. Gray,” who turns out to be Willie Mink, a disgraced pharmaceutical agent whose addiction to Dylar has rendered him more or less insane – exposed to the white noise.</p>
<p>Gladney tracks Mink down and shoots him twice in the gut before placing the gun in Mink’s hands in a laughable attempt to make it look like a suicide. However, the dying Mink shoots Jack in the wrist.</p>
<p>The myth of redemptive violence instantly fades into a parody of redemptive virtue: Gladney decides to try and save Mink’s life. He takes him to a hospital run by German nuns.</p>
<p>At the hospital, Jack’s conversation with one of the nuns brings the chapter to a poignant, jarring close. She explains:</p>
<p><em><strong>Our pretense is a dedication. Someone must appear to believe. Our lives are no less serious than if we professed real faith, real belief. As belief shrinks from the world, people find it more necessary than ever that someone believe. Wild-eyed men in caves. Nuns in black. Monks who do not speak. We are left to believe. Fools, children. Those who have abandoned belief must still believe in us. They are sure they are right not to believe but they know belief must not fade completely. Hell is when no one believes. There must always be believers. Fools, idiots, those who hear voices, those who speak in tongues. We are your lunatics. We surrender our lives to make your nonbelief possible. You are sure that you are right but you don’t want everyone to think as you do. There is no truth without fools. We are your fools, your madwomen, rising at dawn to pray, lighting candles, asking statues for good health, long life.[16]</strong></em></p>
<p>In the world of <em>White Noise</em>, even belief is simulated. Gladney returns home, his mind racing, to watch his children sleep. Similarly, the reader (whose mind is presumably racing as well), is left to watch the novel end.</p>
<p>The fortieth and final chapter of <em>White Noise</em> is dominated by a strange event in which Wilder – the “noble savage,” not yet aware of his own death – rides his tricycle across the expressway and miraculously survives.</p>
<p>The novel then closes in characteristic rapid fire. The Gladneys watch the stunning sunsets over Blacksmith, whose beauty just might be the result of toxins in the atmosphere. Scientists still comb the area, “gathering their terrible data.”[17] Jack is taking no calls. He fears his doctor and the medical technology which are “eager to see how [his] death is progressing.”[18]</p>
<p>The final scene is devoted to the supermarket, the transcendental temple of the postmodern age, “where we wait together, regardless of age, our carts stocked with brightly colored goods.”[19] Appropriately, the signals fade to flat as the reader is left with the image of the supermarket tabloid racks – containing “the cults of the famous and the dead.”</p>
<p><em>Fame</em> and <em>death</em>. Searching for center, gripped by thanatophobia. White noise.</p>
<h1 id="the-bhopal-disasterhttpenwikipediaorgwikibhopal_disastersupsup20supsup"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster"><strong>The Bhopal Disaster</strong></a><strong><sup></strong><sup>[20]</sup><strong></sup></strong></h1>
<p><em>White Noise</em> was first published in January 1985, not long after a disastrous chemical leak in Bhopal, central India.</p>
<p>On the evening of December 3, 1984, a storage tank of methyl isocyanate (MIC, used to produce pesticide) ruptured at the Union Carbide plant, releasing toxic fumes which northwestern winds blew into the shantytowns of Bhopal. The white fumes wreaked havoc on the populace, littering the streets with corpses or vomiting, defecating individuals about to die. “As many as 200,000 people ran through the city streets, coughing, screaming and calling out to each other.”[21]</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, the factory siren went off at around 2:00am, causing many to think that a fire had started. Hundreds rushed toward the plant in order to help – unknowingly entering the path of the lethal gas. Unlike <em>White Noise</em>, there was no SIMUVAC.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Bhopal-Union_Carbide_1_crop_memorial.jpg/225px-Bhopal-Union_Carbide_1_crop_memorial.jpg" alt="Bhopal-Union Carbide 1 crop memorial.jpg"  />
</p>
<p>Bhopal was rendered a city of corpses.</p>
<p>The unimaginable chaos left rescue workers searching for the dead three days after the incident. Orphans wandered the streets. The death toll rose to over 2,500, with as many as 100,000 permanently-disabled survivors – suffering from “blindness, sterility, kidney and liver infections, tuberculosis and brain damage.”[22] Muslims were placed into hurriedly-dug graves. As many as seventy Hindu funeral pyres lit the night. The district had to ship in more wood just to feed the crematory fires.</p>
<p>Much like <em>White Noise</em>, rumors and fear spread quickly in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Authorities had to reassure the people that an early-morning fog was not a new leak, that their milk and vegetables had not been contaminated. Furthermore, the real-life Nyodene D, MIC, was every bit as unstable and unknown – no antidote, no treatment. The physical effects of low-level exposure were predicted to fade with time. However, the same could not be said for those who survived heavier exposure. Their suffering would be indefinite.</p>
<p>Bhopal briefly shocked the American public (some of them, anyway) into an uncomfortable awareness of the danger of the ubiquitous chemicals that surrounded them – in factories, on wheels, and in products. Some demanded to know just how dangerous these chemicals were, in the interests of public safety. Others, like the Reagan administration, defended companies’ rights to trade secrets, in the interests of the free market.</p>
<p>Who will die first? Average Americans, or the denizens of the developing world? Savage nobles, or noble savages? Incidents like the fictional Airborne Toxic Event and the actual Bhopal disaster, along with our reactions to such tragedies, are telling.</p>
<p>The former beg us to come to grips with our mortality, with the rate at which technology outpaces our efforts to control it. As Murray put it: “[technology] creates an appetite for immortality on the one hand. It threatens universal extinction on the other. Technology is lust removed from nature.”[23]</p>
<p>As Newsweek put it: “Experts elsewhere said that many of the victims in India would not have been alive at all if not for chemicals that increased food supplies, reduced the incidence of malaria and improved sanitation. Judged against such benefits, the risks of chemical accidents seem more acceptable.”[24]</p>
<p>BLACKSMITH. BHOPAL. BENGAY. BRILLO. Which death should we fear?</p>
<h1 id="the-hyperreal-fear-of-death-in-white-noise"><strong>The Hyperreal Fear of Death in White Noise</strong></h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/WikipediaBaudrillard20040612-cropped.png/220px-WikipediaBaudrillard20040612-cropped.png" alt="WikipediaBaudrillard20040612-cropped.png"  />
</p>
<p>According to Jean Baudrillard, <strong>hyperreality</strong> is “<em><strong>the generation by models of a real without origin or reality</strong></em>.”<sup><sup>[25]</sup></sup></p>
<p>When our simulations of reality become indistinguishable from the reality itself, we have entered into the realm of the hyperreal. Not only is it difficult (some would say impossible) to reach beyond the simulations, but we often prefer the simulations to reality itself.</p>
<p>Examples of this abound throughout <em>White Noise</em>. Consider “the most photographed barn in America,” which has been so thoroughly eclipsed by its own simulacra that it remains impossible to be seen. In Murray’s words: “they are taking pictures of taking pictures.”<sup><sup>[26]</sup></sup> Mentioned above, Jack’s search for center in Hitler studies and the SIMUVAC procedure are further significant examples of the hyperreal in <em>White Noise</em>.</p>
<p>Not even (the fear of) death escapes the influences of hyperreality. Although at first glance death seems a weighty enough subject to break through the simulacra and connect humanity with reality, under closer examination, death evades our grasp.</p>
<p>Central to the complex dynamics of the hyperreal fear of death are the simulacra of death, often weightier than the thing itself. Consider how Gladney’s fear of death is more intense than death itself. It is the nebulous ambiguity of his Nyodene D death sentence which threatens to undo him, much more than the chemical itself.</p>
<p>In a vicious cycle, the various fear-driven ways in which we react to death make our fear of death that much more complicated. That is, it can get quite confusing to discern whether or not we are afraid of actual death, or merely our various representations of it.</p>
<p>After all, death itself can only be experienced once.[27] Until the end, we spend a lifetime fearing that which we have not experienced.</p>
<p>The first strategy is <em><strong>avoidance</strong></em>, distancing ourselves from the terrifying and uncomfortable. Consider the euphemism. People do not just “die,” they “pass away,” “move on,” “kick the bucket,” “hang up their tennis shoes” (Spanish), and “fall asleep” (Koine Greek).</p>
<p>The second strategy is <em><strong>embrace</strong></em>, subversively trying to strip death of its fear by exploring the macabre. Consider horror movies. Sure, they rely on the fear of death, but they also attempt to treat it – giving the audience the strength to say “I’ve seen worse” when it comes to their own (probably) mediocre deaths. These first two approaches are often combined. The hero attempts to transcend death through valor, to embrace death through battle-hardened courage. Jack Gladney attempts to avoid and embrace death through Hitler, who was “larger than death.”[28]</p>
<p>A third strategy is <em><strong>examination</strong></em>. This is best illustrated within <em>White Noise</em> by Murray, whose quote to Jack during the ATE merits quotation at length:</p>
<p><em>“This is the nature of modern death,” Murray said. “It has a life independent of us. It is growing in prestige and dimension. It has a sweep it never had before. We study it objectively. We can predict its appearance, trace its path in the body. We can take cross-section pictures of it, tape its tremors and waves. We’ve never been so close to it, so familiar with its habits and attitudes. <strong>We know it intimately. But it continues to grow, to acquire breadth and scope, new outlets, new passages and means. The more we learn, the more it grows.</strong> Is this some law of physics? Every advance in knowledge and technique is matched by a new kind of death, a new strain. <strong>Death adapts, like a viral agent</strong>.”<sup><sup>[29]</sup></sup></em></p>
<p>If we embrace death to strip it of fear, we examine death and attempt to fight it in order to strip it of mystery. However, this is an unsuccessful endeavor. Death eludes our grasp and overpowers our assaults.</p>
<p>On a personal note, this was poignantly illustrated by my wife – a nursing student. A baby boy was transferred into the hospital, severely wounded by what appeared to be abuse –broken bones, cigarette burns and bruises, ostentatiously and haphazardly concealed with makeup.</p>
<p>Although the doctors had managed to restart his heart and place him on life support, the first brain scan revealed no activity. During the mandatory twelve-hour wait until the second test, my wife took care of the boy. After the second scan revealed no activity, he was taken off life support and allowed to die.</p>
<p>However, as my wife tearfully recounted the story to me that night, she wondered when the boy had actually died. <strong>Had she, in any meaningful sense, been taking care of a living patient simply because his heart was beating? Or was he dead the entire time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>When do we die? When our heart stops beating? Our lungs stop breathing? Or when our brains stop making waves?</strong></p>
<p>More importantly, <strong>whose death do we fear?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/73df8-ekg_flatline1024x682.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<h2 id="it-is-my-contention-that-we-cannot-really-fear-our-own-deaths">It is my contention that <strong>we cannot really fear our <em>own</em> deaths</strong>.</h2>
<p>Like Jack Gladney, we are limited to fearing and interacting with death’s simulacra.</p>
<p>We might long to die like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(film)">Leonidas in <em>The 300</em></a>, but not like a contestant in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_(franchise)">the “games” of <em>SAW</em></a>.</p>
<p>If we have not yet experienced the death of a close family member, we might imagine the event through the lens of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_News_(How_I_Met_Your_Mother)">Marshall’s father dying in <em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a>.</p>
<p>Even when we have had a family member, or even a patient die, we never fully experience death without dying ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>We are surrounded by death, in Dylar ingredient lists and Union Carbide storage tanks, in the skies above Blacksmith and the alleys of Bhopal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And yet we are insulated from it by euphemism and fiction, by news anchor and liquid-crystal display – by the idiosyncrasies of our continuously temporal existence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are familiar with death, but we know it not.</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey internet: I was recently given the chance to preach at my church, &lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/&#34;&gt;St. Peter’s Anglican&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25&#34;&gt;Second Sunday of Lent&lt;/a&gt;.

<p>Words fail.</p>
<p>Cedarville, get your act together. Prospective students, stay far away until the institution recovers it’s broad evangelical vision (the one carried forward by Bill Brown and Carl Ruby, for example). Unfortunately, it appears that vision has been thoroughly squashed in the conservative takeover.</p>

      <title>Concerning Romans</title>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/&#34;&gt;concerned the chaos at Cedarville University&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;my shameful alma mater&lt;/a&gt; at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets&#34;&gt;2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow (see&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/07/my-regional-ets-presentation-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/&#34;&gt; my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, and come to my presentation at &lt;strong&gt;5:00pm in room S009!&lt;/strong&gt;), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

</p>
<p>Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/">concerned the chaos at Cedarville University</a>!</p>
<p>However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">my shameful alma mater</a> at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets">2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS</a> tomorrow (see<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/07/my-regional-ets-presentation-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/"> my previous post</a>, and come to my presentation at <strong>5:00pm in room S009!</strong>), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, given the current discussion in my New Testament Theology — two classes on Romans — I thought I might re-post two of my previous works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/06/28/romans-revisited-pt-1/">Romans. Revisited.</a> (or <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/05/03/the-argument-story-of-romans/">“The Argument-Story of Romans”</a>):</strong> my final write-up for Dr. Chris Miller’s course on Romans and Galatians at Cedarville University. We were due to have an oral exam on the last day of class, in which we talked-through the logic of the epistle. I wrote this summary the night before the exam, and was given the opportunity to present it to the class. I now present it to you! Feel free to give me some push-back!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/romans-13/">Romans 13:1-7 — A Contextually-Appropriate Reading</a>:</strong> a paper I wrote for the same course as mentioned above, in which I defend the following thesis: <strong>“Far from being a comprehensive condensation of the apostle’s beliefs regarding any and all governments past and present, [Romans 13:1-7] is a specific and historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, discouraging them from political unrest, disobedience, and rebellion in order to protect their testimony and the effectiveness of the Roman church in the gospel mission.”</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all for now. Grace and Peace.</p>

I wish I could say I was proud of my alma mater…</p>
<p>Despite my Lenten Facebook fast, I was made aware of <strong>the following post</strong> by my friend <a href="http://marlenagraves.com/"><strong>Marlena Graves</strong></a>. I thought I’d share it, just in case anyone is considering Cedarville as a choice for college. I’d still strongly recommend you attend another institution, where you can trust the administration. My <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/">previous thoughts</a> on<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/02/19/oh-cedarville/"> these matters</a> still <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">stand</a>.</p>
<p>======</p>
<p>“Dear friends,</p>
<p>“Every. Single. Week. I am contacted by people who attend and work at CU who are just miserable. I pray about what to say and what not to say; my motives aren’t malicious. This morning I was reading about Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and how he couldn’t believe that the Christians in Germany remained silent about Hitler or actively conspired with Hitler to get rid of the Jews. This situation at CU is no Germany. But faculty and staff at the school I loved are now forced into silence. They’re being oppressed. If they speak, they’ll lose their jobs. Their FB accounts and e-mails are monitored. A coup occurred at CU as it did at Southern Seminary, Southwestern Seminary, and Southeastern Seminary at the hands of Paige Patterson. Paige Patterson is now a trustee and mentor to the new president, Dr. White. Many who made decisions who fought to keep us and our friends (Bible profs/Carl Ruby and others) at the school told us that it was a coup. So the current administration doesn’t care about what fac/staff think. And students are there temporarily so….The chair of the board has said that he is willing to take the school down to 1200 to get their way. Shawn and I can afford to speak up because we didn’t sign a non-disclosure agreement. We are thriving and not bitter. But, I do get angry about how people are being treated. Thank God Shawn got a job right away and didn’t have to worry about providing for his family. Every single person who knows me will tell you I deliberate about my words. I am tired of the pain people are going through. And so I speak up because I can. I think this is the last chance for those currently there to give an outcry. Otherwise it’s over for them. They have moved to forbid egalitarians from teaching there, too. Next year, if you cannot say you are comp, you cannot work there. Only money and power can accomplish such a coup. I have no money or power. But, I have the freedom to speak up. So this below is just more evidence of what is going on. Students pray for your professors and staff. Many are suffering and can’t even tell you. Many of their jobs are on the line. They continue to clean house while silencing people. Pay attention to who is no longer there and from where they hire their new faculty. I’ve lost count of who is gone. People have to decide whether or not they’ll feed their families or speak up. So please, speak up on their behalf!</p>
<p>“Take a look at the fall course schedule. The new female Bible prof’s classes are limited to female students only:<a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/courses/schedule/2014fa_bi_beth.htm">http://www.cedarville.edu/courses/schedule/2014fa_bi_beth.htm</a>. Even under Dr. Dixon, that was never the case for Jean Fisher’s classes.”</p>

&lt;/a&gt;I’m happy to announce that Rachel and I will be completing my required &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/cross-culturalministrypracticums&#34;&gt;Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt; along with our good friends Kyle, Rebekah, and baby Luke DeBoer in Lima, Peru this summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to assist &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abweperu.org/page_family/pagefamily.php?id=12&#34;&gt;the Stone families&lt;/a&gt; (Dave &amp;amp; Evelyn; Jonathan &amp;amp; Angela) in their various local ministries, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stblima.org/&#34;&gt;Seminario Teológico Bautista&lt;/a&gt; (Seminary)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Beeson’s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to “&lt;em&gt;expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting&lt;/em&gt;.” In addition to fulfilling this goal, we believe that this trip to Peru will be &lt;strong&gt;influential in determining the future involvement of both our families in global missions&lt;/strong&gt;. God’s given each of us unique gifts — ranging from medicine to math, theology to linguistics. But &lt;strong&gt;He’s blessed us all with a heart for His global Gospel and his global Church&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you’re in the Birmingham area from March 21-22, 2014, and you’re interested in evangelical theology, please consider attending the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets&#34;&gt;Evangelical Theological Society’s Southeastern Regional Meeting at Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt;! This year’s theme is “the theological interpretation of Scripture,” and the plenary speaker is Wheaton’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/T/Daniel-Treier&#34;&gt;Daniel J. Treier&lt;/a&gt; (incidentally, Dr. Treier and I are both alumni of Cedarville…go figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if you’re free from 5:00-5:30pm on Friday, March 21, consider swinging by room S009 to hear me present &lt;strong&gt;“Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof: Atonement, Ecclesiology, and the Unity of God.”&lt;/strong&gt; The atonement and the unity of the Church are topics that I’m passionate about, and I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity to give my first ever conference paper. Here’s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This year’s theme is “the theological interpretation of Scripture,” and the plenary speaker is Wheaton’s <a href="http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/T/Daniel-Treier">Daniel J.

Here’s the abstract:</p>
<div>This essay endeavors **to demonstrate the theological and exegetical legitimacy of viewing the atonement as the act in which the one God fulfills his creative purposes by bringing his uniqueness and simplicity to bear on our sinful, divisive condition through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah in order to save a people to robust unity with himself, each other, and the entire creation**. Given Adam Johnson’s thesis regarding God’s triune being-in-act, the fullness of the divine perfections, and the unity and diversity of Christ’s saving work, I draw upon the theology of Karl Barth and pertinent biblical data to frame a theory of the atonement based on the unity of God. Although the lack of ecclesiological unity is the impetus for my study, I choose primarily to emphasize the synthesis of God’s unity and the doctrine of reconciliation. That is, I focus on the theological explanations within the atonement of *why* the church is to be unified. However, after framing a unity-based theory of the atonement, I conclude this study by casting a vision for the ecclesiological implications of such a theory.
</div>![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dCQpiZIQL._SY344_PJlook-inside-v2,TopRight,1,0_SH20_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)If you can’t make it to my presentation, but you’re interested in the topic, check out [my previous series of posts ](https://joshuapsteele.com/reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/)and the [undergraduate thesis paper](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof.pdf) from which this conference paper is drawn. Also, consider buying the new paperback edition of [Adam J. Johnson’s *God’s Being in Reconciliation: The Theological Basis of the Unity and Diversity of the Atonement in the Theology of Karl Barth* (T&amp;T Clark Studies in Systematic Theology)](http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Being-Reconciliation-Theological-Systematic/dp/0567123456/). It’s much cheaper than the previous hardcover edition, and without his fresh insights into the doctrine of the atonement and Barthian theology, my paper would not have been possible.
<p>Finally, please attend the entire conference at Beeson if possible! <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/assets/1346/ets_southeast_2014_schedule_1_page.pdf">Here’s the full schedule</a>.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the break between semesters at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt;, I’m reviewing Bruce Waltke’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eerdmans.com/Products/6736/the-dance-between-god-and-humanity.aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dance Between God and Humanity: Reading the Bible Today as the People of God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Philip Goodwin’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Translating-English-Bible-Relevance-Deconstruction/dp/0227173910&#34;&gt;Translating the English Bible: From Relevance to Deconstruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hope.ac.uk/theologicalbookreview/&#34;&gt;Liverpool Hope University’s Theological Book Review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve just finished the latter, and hope to write my review in the next day or two. However, I’d like to share the following quotes on &lt;em&gt;Deconstructive Literalism&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Perfect Translation&lt;/em&gt;, because I find the concepts intriguing as a student of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence&#34;&gt;Eugene Nida’s dynamic or functional equivalence&lt;/a&gt; (when it comes to both NT Greek and modern Spanish), and a newcomer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_theory&#34;&gt;relevance theory&lt;/a&gt;, which Goodwin uses to provide a way forward in the shadow of the KJV tradition. More on that later. In the meantime:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’ve just finished the latter, and hope to write my review in the next day or two. However, I’d like to share the following quotes on <em>Deconstructive Literalism</em> and <em>The Perfect Translation</em>, because I find the concepts intriguing as a student of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence">Eugene Nida’s dynamic or functional equivalence</a> (when it comes to both NT Greek and modern Spanish), and a newcomer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_theory">relevance theory</a>, which Goodwin uses to provide a way forward in the shadow of the KJV tradition. More on that later. In the meantime:</p>
<p>“What <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Control-Biblical-Meaning-Mechanism/dp/B008SLHBC8">Aichele</a> has noticed is that <strong>if the interpreter wants to ‘see’ the source text, he or she would prefer not to have another interpreter standing in the way. The problem with a dynamic equivalence translation, then, is that it does not permit deconstruction of the source text</strong>. The translation represents an ideological undertaking which <em>itself</em> can be readily deconstructed, but does not provide access to the source. (207-8).</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“Now, of course <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Word-God-English-Translation/dp/1581344643">Ryken and Collins</a>, whilst advocating concordant translation on the one hand, also desire, on the other hand, to maintain the control over meaning to which Aichele refers, by implicitly linking concordance to thematics. In other words, concordance is seen as desirable because it reinforces the theme (‘the message’, again) of the text, to which it is seen as a servant. They leave unexamined the question of <strong>what to do when the phenomenon of concordance might be turned <em>against</em> thematics, to undermine it — to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction">deconstruct</a> it. One man’s exegesis is, however, another’s deconstruction</strong>. <strong>A concordant translation of a text might serve equally to reveal Aichele’s ‘defects and problems’ or Ryken’s ‘full exegetical potential’ — to reinforce its ‘intention’, or to undermine it. I will argue that it does both</strong>. (208).</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“The perfect translation is the one whose relationship to a source text is such that it <strong>permits both the construction of the releveant interpretation of that text, and its deconstruction</strong>.” (209).</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;As the briefest member of the Pauline corpus, the epistle to Philemon is a letter of recommendation for the sake of reconciliation in which the apostle Paul brings the gospel truth of mutual participation in the body of Christ to bear on an estranged relationship – making a delicate request of his friend Philemon to receive back a certain Onesimus into full fellowship as a brother in Christ.&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn1&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">As the briefest member of the Pauline corpus, the epistle to Philemon is a letter of recommendation for the sake of reconciliation in which the apostle Paul brings the gospel truth of mutual participation in the body of Christ to bear on an estranged relationship – making a delicate request of his friend Philemon to receive back a certain Onesimus into full fellowship as a brother in Christ.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn1"><span style="color: #000000;">[1]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Comprehension of the passage’s contemporaneous Greco-Roman epistolary landscape facilitates a knowledgeable analysis of its constituent parts.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn2"><span style="color: #000000;">[2]</span></a> Subsequently, the interpretive insights yielded by this examination facilitate an application of the letter to the contemporary Christian church.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000greco-roman-lettersspan"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Greco-Roman Letters</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Originally referring to “an oral communication sent by messenger,” the Hellenistic ἐπιστολή eventually encompassed a wide variety of documents – from commercial to legal, political to personal.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn3"><span style="color: #000000;">[3]</span></a> As Greidanus notes, the basic form of a Greco-Roman letter was tripartite, consisting of introduction/opening, body, and conclusion.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn4"><span style="color: #000000;">[4]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first section named the sender and addressee, often including a brief greeting and “a wish for good health.”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn5"><span style="color: #000000;">[5]</span></a> Most difficult to analyze formally, the body of Hellenistic letters was flexible enough to encompass content suited to each writing’s particular communicative act.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn6"><span style="color: #000000;">[6]</span></a> Finally, “greetings to persons other than the addressee, a final greeting or prayer sentence, and sometimes a date” comprised a typical conclusion to Greco-Roman epistles.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn7"><span style="color: #000000;">[7]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In contrast to literary essays and official documents of the day, written to general audiences apart from any relational context, Paul’s letters are more private and personal – exhibiting his pastoral concern for those to whom he was a representative of Christ and an elder in the faith.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn8"><span style="color: #000000;">[8]</span></a> Nevertheless, the Pauline epistles arguably exceed their contemporaneous correspondence in length, structure, and didactic intent.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn9"><span style="color: #000000;">[9]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Although Paul understandably followed the prevailing Greco-Roman form in his own letters, he nonetheless freely adapted the epistolary conventions of the day to suit his own purposes. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, as O’Brien notes, although “on occasion the more intimate letters of the Hellenistic period began with a thanksgiving to the gods for personal benefits received,” Paul expanded and developed the introductory thanksgiving/blessing section in his writings more often than any writer of his day, yielding a mix of Hellenistic form with Jewish and Christian content which is present in most of his letters.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn10"><span style="color: #000000;">[10]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly, Paul often modified the Greco-Roman form by including a concluding paranetic section of exhortation after the body of his letters.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn11"><span style="color: #000000;">[11]</span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000analysis-of-philemonspan"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Analysis of Philemon</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">An appreciation of Pauline epistolary form in Greco-Roman context yields important interpretive insights relating to both the parts and whole of the letter to Philemon, in which Paul displays remarkable tact as he advances his request for reconciliation between Philemon and Onesimus.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn12"><span style="color: #000000;">[12]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although lacking a definite section of paranesis, the epistle is composed of </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">an opening greeting (Philem 1-3), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">thanksgiving/prayer (4-7), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">body (8-22), </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">and closing (23-25).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn13"><span style="color: #000000;">[13]</span></a> </span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opening-greeting">Opening Greeting</h3>
<p>Of immediate note, Paul atypically refers to himself, in the midst of an otherwise standard greeting, not as an apostle (cf. Gal 1:1) or servant (cf. Rom 1:1; Phil 1:1), but as “a prisoner of Christ Jesus” (Philem 1; NRSV) – perhaps best explained by his desire throughout “to entreat rather than command” (cf. 8-9), but also to stress Onesimus’ usefulness to him in his captivity (cf. 11-13).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn14"><span style="color: #000000;">[14]</span></a></p>
<p>Sender (“Paul…and Timothy”; Philem 1a), and addressee (“Philemon…Apphia…Archippus…and the church in your house”; 1b-2) thus identified, Paul’s signature greeting of χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη (3) functions as a benedictional transition to a section of thanksgiving and prayer (4-7), which – as elsewhere in the Pauline corpus – introduces the letter’s main themes.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn15"><span style="color: #000000;">[15]</span></a></p>
<h3 id="thanksgivingprayer">Thanksgiving/Prayer</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As Bruce notes, “the ground of the thanksgiving and the substance of the prayer are closely related to the purpose of the letter.”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn16"><span style="color: #000000;">[16]</span></a> Paul gives thanks to God because of Philemon’s love, faith, and refreshment of “the hearts of the saints” (Philem 5, 7). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The content of Paul’s subsequent prayer, then, is that “the sharing of [Philemon’s] faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ” (6; ESV). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the phrase ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου is better translated as “the mutual belonging which is proper to your faith,” referring to, as Wright puts it, “the mutuality of the Christian life which, springing from common participation in the body of Christ, extends beyond mere common concern into actual exchange” – a mutual belonging which lies at the heart of Paul’s argument and requests throughout the epistle.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn17"><span style="color: #000000;">[17]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to introducing the key themes of love/heart (cf. ἀγάπη, 4,7,9; σπλάγχνα, 7,12,20) and mutual participation (cf. κοινωνόν, 17), the thanksgiving/prayer rhetorically establishes mutual goodwill as an exordium in which Paul emphasizes characteristics of Philemon to which he can then appeal.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn18"><span style="color: #000000;">[18]</span></a></span></p>
<h3 id="body">Body</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The main request of the letter’s body – of noteworthy length in its Greco-Roman context – is that <strong>Philemon should receive Onesimus just as he would receive Paul</strong> (17b).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn19"><span style="color: #000000;">[19]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A</span><span style="color: #000000;">lthough Paul makes use of every persuasive tactic at his disposal – including concession of apostolic authority (8; 19b), emotional appeal (9, 12), pun (11), and appeal to honor (14) – the main thrust of the argument depends on the “<strong>mutual belonging</strong>” (6) between Philemon and Onesimus now that the latter has become a Christian during Paul’s captivity (10).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn20"><span style="color: #000000;">[20]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Regardless of the exact nature of the past estrangement (about which Paul remains virtually silent), Philemon is urged to interpret the seemingly unfortunate state of affairs as an opportunity for eternal reconciliation (15-16), transferring any debts that Onesimus had incurred to Paul’s own account instead (18). In receiving back Onesimus, Paul’s “very heart” (12b), as “a beloved brother” (16), Philemon would continue his refreshment of the saints’ hearts (7) by refreshing Paul’s heart (20).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn21"><span style="color: #000000;">[21]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Here, then, is an analogous microcosm of the gospel itself – a fulfillment of Paul’s prayer for κοινωνία (6) and of the cruciform “ministry of reconciliation” of 2 Corinthians 5:16-21 and Colossians 1:24-29.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn22"><span style="color: #000000;">[22]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As Wright notes, just as in Christ God reconciles the entire world to himself (2 Cor 5:19), “God is in Paul reconciling Philemon and Onesimus” – who both owed a debt, so to speak, to the apostle for their conversion (Philem 10, 19b).<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn23"><span style="color: #000000;">[23]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Confident of Philemon’s compliance with his reconciliatory request (21), Paul makes an additional request for lodging based on Paul’s hope for release from imprisonment and subsequent travel to Colossae to be present with his audience (22) – an epistolary structure known as the “apostolic parousia,” revealing Paul’s consideration of his writings as substitutes for his physical presence.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn24"><span style="color: #000000;">[24]</span></a> </span></p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, Paul reports the greetings of his gospel co-workers to Philemon (23-24), before reverting to the plural to include the other addressees (2) in his concluding benediction.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn25"><span style="color: #000000;">[25]</span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000applicationspan"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Application</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If the consensus interpretation that Onesimus is Philemon’s runaway slave is correct, then Deuteronomy 23:15-16 would seem to mandate that Paul <strong>not</strong> return the fugitive to his estranged master. <a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn26"><span style="color: #000000;">[26]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the reality of their mutual belonging in Christ compelled the apostle to facilitate the reconciliation now possible due to the Messiah’s death, burial, and resurrection (cf. 2 Cor 5:16-21). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, Lightfoot reveals a potential hurdle for modern readers of this ancient text when he notes that, <strong>though “the word ‘emancipation’ seems to be trembling on [Paul’s] lips…he does not once utter it.”</strong><a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn27"><span style="color: #000000;">[27]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first step in resolving this frustration involves the clear delineation between the context of slavery in which Onesimus lived, the transatlantic slave trade of the 16<sup>th</sup> through 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, and the modern day slavery of human trafficking and forced labor – for it is far too easy to conflate the three in indignation at Paul’s failure to request Onesimus’ freedom.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn28"><span style="color: #000000;">[28]</span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then, once the anachronism of expecting Paul to be a modern abolitionist is noted, it can be clearly seen that, as Bruce observes, <strong>though the epistle to Philemon “throws little light on Paul’s attitude to the institution of slavery,” it brings “the institution into an atmosphere where it could only wilt and die.</strong>”<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn29"><span style="color: #000000;">[29]</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After all, the same κοινωνία that enabled Philemon and Onesimus to be reconciled could not help but <strong>destroy</strong> the dynamics of slavery within the kingdom of God and body of Christ – where “there is no longer slave or free,” but all are “one in Christ Jesus” (Gal 3:28). </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to the world, Onesimus belonged to Philemon as a slave. According to Christ, they belonged to one another as brothers. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although here in Philemon, as elsewhere (cf. Col 3:22-4:1), Paul stops short of prohibiting slavery, it is clear that he understood the gospel of Jesus Christ inescapably to transform the divisive condition of humanity into a restored, eternal unity which transcended all temporal divisions (cf. 1 Cor 7:17-24; Col 3:11). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Paul’s tactful requests reveal that <strong>the bond between Philemon and Onesimus as brothers in the Lord</strong> (Philem 16) <strong>was far stronger than the social expectations of master and slave.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Transcending the issue of slavery – yet simultaneously striking at its very core – Paul’s masterfully crafted epistle to Philemon reminds Christians in every age to apply consistently the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ to their relationships, in spite of individualism’s siren song, which might tempt them to manipulate and dominate instead of to mutually belong to one another in κοινωνία. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, readers of Paul’s letter to Philemon should follow his peace-making example by seeking to be ministers of reconciliation in their respective contexts – no matter how discordant or seemingly insignificant. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This brief letter thus coheres with the biblical theme of <strong>unity</strong>. Because God is one, his people are called to be one as well – a community of forgiven women and men, Jews and Gentiles, even slaves and masters who forgive each other’s debts and refresh each other’s hearts in the κοινωνία of their faith in Jesus their Messiah.<a href="/Users/Joshua/Google%20Drive/Beeson/1%20Fall%202013/Biblical%20Interp/Papers/JoshuaSteeleEpistle.docx#_ftn30"><span style="color: #000000;">[30]</span></a></span></p>

Aune, *The New Testament in Its Literary Environment* (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1987) 211-2 and W.W. Klein, C.L. Blomberg and R.L. Hubbard, Jr., *Introduction to Biblical Interpretation*, Rev. Ed. (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2004) 431. This paper assumes the “consensus view” of the epistle’s provenance: namely, that the apostle Paul is addressing Philemon of Colossae regarding the estranged slave and now convert, Onesimus. The creative reconstruction of J. Knox, in which the extant epistle to Philemon is the “letter from Laodicea” (Col 4:16) which was written by Paul to Archippus (Philem 2), master of Onesimus, is here ignored; cf. J. Knox, *Philemon Among the Letters of Paul* (New York: Abingdon, 1959). For critical responses to Knox’s claims from the consensus view, see F.F. Bruce, *The Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Ephesians*, NICNT (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1984) 198-202; G.B.

Of note, though impossible to explain fully, is Epaphras’ designation as Paul’s “fellow prisoner” instead of a “fellow worker” as the others. However, Bruce notes that, as “the evangelist of the Lycus valley” in which Colossae was located (cf. Col 1:7; 4:12), Epaphras “would be personally known to Philemon,” and thus merit distinct mention. Bruce*, Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians*, 213-4.

It is likely that Philemon and Onesimus’ relationship was different than that between a normal master and slave. See T.G.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Black Friday proves that the progress of (post)modernity has failed to eradicate the ills of idolatry. Lest we denizens of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index&#34;&gt;“highly-developed” world &lt;/a&gt;think that we have left the primitive vestiges of wood, rock, and gold idolatry behind, our shopping patterns (and indeed our shopping identities as consumers) should remind us of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-25153350&#34;&gt;our consumerism’s dark side&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blackfridaydeathcount.com/&#34;&gt;lethal one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Although physical idols may not be as universally common today as they once were, invisible idols are as prevalent as ever, especially within the context of Western materialism, where money, possessions, influence, and power are the modern-day &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal&#34;&gt;Baal&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Friday proves that the progress of (post)modernity has failed to eradicate the ills of idolatry. Lest we denizens of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index">“highly-developed” world </a>think that we have left the primitive vestiges of wood, rock, and gold idolatry behind, our shopping patterns (and indeed our shopping identities as consumers) should remind us of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-25153350">our consumerism’s dark side</a> — a <a href="http://blackfridaydeathcount.com/">lethal one</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve put in <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/">“Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof”:</a></p>
<p>“Although physical idols may not be as universally common today as they once were, invisible idols are as prevalent as ever, especially within the context of Western materialism, where money, possessions, influence, and power are the modern-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal">Baal</a>.”</p>
<p>If you DO happen to find yourself shopping on Black Friday, or really at any point during the upcoming shopping/holiday (an increasingly blurred line) season — allow me to recommend heartily the following book: <a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/the-economy-of-desire/283830">The Economy of Desire by Daniel M. Bell, Jr</a>. Here’s a poignant quote:</p>
<p><strong>“Capitalism distorts the creative power that is human desire by constantly creating new objects/idols for its fascination. It entices desire with an endless array of distractions. The enchantments of capitalist production are distractions precisely because they cannot satisfy our desire. And as far as capitalism is concerned, this is a good thing, for satisfied desire would spell an end to capitalism, which depends on the frenetic power of unquenched desire to drive its productive engines.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“In contrast, Christianity proclaims the good news that we can indeed find rest from the rat race that is the conflict of the capitalist market. Our desire finds its true home, its rest, its delight in communion with God. Desire’s true fascination is the radiance of love that is the glorious life of the blessed Trinity. For this reason, humanity might rightly be called <em>homo adorans</em> — worshiping beings. We are not beings caught in an endless cycle of trucking and bartering (<em>homo economicus</em>) but beings inclined to worship and enjoy the divine love that provides all we need. In other words, because the Lord is our shepherd, we shall not want (Ps. 23:1). We need not strive endlessly but can be content.” (168)</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t feel like braving the crowds, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Economy-Desire-The-Christianity-Capitalism/dp/0801035732">Bell’s book is available on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>November pierces with its bleak remembrance<br>
Of all the bitterness and waste of war.<br>
Our silence tries but fails to make a semblance<br>
Of that lost peace they thought worth fighting for.<br>
Our silence seeths instead with wraiths and whispers,<br>
And all the restless rumour of new wars,<br>
The shells are singing as we sing our vespers,<br>
No moment is unscarred, there is no pause,<br>
In every instant bloodied innocence<br>
Falls to the weary earth ,and whilst we stand<br>
Quiescence ends again in acquiescence,<br>
And Abel’s blood still cries in every land<br>
One silence only might redeem that blood<br>
Only the silence of a dying God.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://downloads.unmultimedia.org/photo/medium/119/119163.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>“Religions advocate nonviolence in general, while at the same time finding ways to legitimate violence in specific situations; their representatives both preach against war and bless the weapons of their nation’s troops. <strong>And so the deep religious wisdom about nonviolence boils down to a principle that no self-respecting war-lord will deny, namely that you can be violent whenever you cannot be nonviolent, provided your goals are just (which they usually are for the simple reason that they are yours)</strong>. Religious dialogue or no religious dialogue, <strong>without the principled assertion that it <em>is never appropriate to use religion to give moral sanction to the use of violence</em>, religious images and religious leaders will continue to be exploited by politicians and generals engaged in violence.</strong>” (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exclusion-Embrace-Theological-Exploration-Reconciliation/dp/0687002826">Volf, E&amp;E, 286</a>).</p>
<h3 id="finally-volfs-conclusion-eampe-306">Finally, Volf’s conclusion (E&amp;E, 306):</h3>
<p>“<strong>It may be that consistent nonretaliation and nonviolence will be impossible in the world of violence</strong>. Tyrants may need to be taken down from their thrones and the madmen stopped from sowing desolation. […] It may also be that measure which involve preparation for the use of violent means will have to be taken to prevent tyrants and madmen from ascending to power in the first place or to keep the plethora of ordinary kinds of perpetrators that walk our streets from doing their violent work. It may be that in a world suffused with violence the issue is not simply “violence versus peace” but rather “what forms of violence could be tolerated to overcome a social ‘peace’ that coercively maintained itself through the condoned violence of injustice” (Suchocki 1995, 117). <strong>But if one decides to put on soldier’s gear instead of carrying one’s cross, one should not seek legitimation in the religion that worships the crucified Messiah. For there, the blessing is given not to the violent but to the meek (Matthew 5:5)</strong>.</p>
<p>“<strong>There are Christians who have a hard time resisting the temptation to seek religious legitimation for their (understandable) need to take up the sword. If they give in to this temptation, they should forego all attempts to exonerate their vision of Christian faith from complicity in fomenting violence</strong>. <strong>Of course, they can specify that religious symbols should be used to legitimate and inspire only <em>just</em> wars. But show me one warring party that does not think its wars is just!</strong> Simple logic tells us that at least half of them <em>must</em> be wrong. <strong>It could be, however, that simple logic does not apply the chaotic world of wars. Then all would be right, which is to say that all would be wrong, which is to say that terror would reign — in the name of gods who can no longer be distinguished from the devils.</strong>“</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction-the-holy-trinity">Introduction: The Holy Trinity</h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One God. Three persons. The Holy Trinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The orthodox paradox of this Christian confession confounds many, due to its apparent contradictions, abstractions, and absence from Scripture. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From Arius to Augustine and beyond, trinitarian debates have raged even among those who agree that God exists, that the Bible is true, and that it is therefore worthwhile to consider what the Bible says because it reveals the existent God. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although the best discussions of the Trinity begin with an acknowledgment of its inscrutable mystery which eludes the grasp of human reason’s highest reach, a sober analysis of the doctrine’s canonical presence and historical outworking may help to answer the charges that the Trinity is a nonsensical, unbiblical abstraction worthy of abandonment. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although it is precisely the Trinity’s classical formulation that receives the criticisms just noted, it is important to begin at the end, so to speak, by introducing the operative terms before analyzing the scriptural context <em>out of which</em> and the historical context <em>in which</em> these trinitarian terms grew. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The definitive statement of trinitarian belief is the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 CE, discussed below.<a href="#sdfootnote1sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>1</sup></span></a> In brief, however, Christians confess belief in one God who eternally and only exists in one divine substance, essence, or <em>ousia</em>, and in three divine subsistences, Persons, or <em>hypostases</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote2sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>2</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One in three, three in one: Father, Son, and Spirit – each Person equally and essentially God, and yet each distinct from the other two.</span></p>

<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000is-the-trinity-in-the-bible--canonical-presencespan"><span style="color: #000000;">Is the Trinity in the Bible? – Canonical Presence</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A common objection to the doctrine of the Trinity as just stated is that it nowhere appears within the pages of Scripture. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And indeed, despite the favorite trinitarian proof-texts in which Father, Son, and Spirit appear together, “no doctrine of the Trinity in the Nicene sense is present in [even] the New Testament.”<a href="#sdfootnote3sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>3</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, as Jenson persuasively argues, “the doctrine of the Trinity is indeed in Scripture, <em>if</em> one abandons modernity’s notion that statement in so many words as formulated is the only way that a doctrine can appear there.”<a href="#sdfootnote4sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></a> Instead, the <em>narrative</em> of Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.”<a href="#sdfootnote5sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>5</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">These three <em>dramatis personae Dei</em>, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a <em>persona</em> in Israel’s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.”<a href="#sdfootnote6sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>6</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">YHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the Father by virtue of Jesus’ address of him as such.<a href="#sdfootnote7sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Son is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address, but also in light of passages such as Psalm 2, appropriated in Hebrews 1 to identify Jesus as the divine Son.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>8</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, the Spirit appears as a <em>persona</em> of the story, first in the OT as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the NT as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>9</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The significance of trinitarian “proof-texts” mentioned above is that they portray the three persons of the divine drama in close proximity. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Most significant of these is the baptismal formula of Matthew 28:19, spoken by the Son himself: “…baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Although the earliest Christians used poignant trinitarian phrases before the full implications of such had been thoroughly considered, these biblical patterns provided “the raw data from which the more developed descriptions of the Christian doctrine of God [would] come.”<a href="#sdfootnote10sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The classical formulation of the Trinity did not arise from a scriptural vacuum.</span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000how-did-we-get-the-doctrine-of-the-trinity--historical-outworkingspan"><span style="color: #000000;">How did we get the “doctrine” of the Trinity? – Historical Outworking</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Neither was the doctrine formed in a historical vacuum. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Instead, as Wainwright notes: “the classic creeds were being formulated at the same time as the canon of the Scriptures was being recognized and determined; there was interaction between the two processes, and the Scriptures and the creeds continue to function reciprocally.”<a href="#sdfootnote11sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>11</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The ecumenical creeds – such as the Apostles’, Niceno-Constantinopolitan (381), and the Chalcedonian <em>Definitio Fidei</em> (451) – serve as an interpretive key to the complex Scriptures, and yet also distill the divine drama of the Bible into a concise summary.<a href="#sdfootnote12sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>12</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A crucial facet of trinitarian doctrine in which this dialectic took place was the distinction between the <em>immanent</em> and the <em>economic</em> Trinity – the former referring to the Trinity within itself, and the latter referring to the Trinity’s external relationship to the universe. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">While the majority of Scripture provides portrayals of the economic Trinity interacting with creation, it also offers enticing glimpses into the immanent relationships between the persons of the divine drama.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>13</sup></span></a> The doctrine that developed from such glimpses offered a way of distinguishing between how God relates to himself and to everything else, but also concluded that “the immanent Trinity lives no other plot than that displayed in the economic Trinity, that when you are taken into the story told in Scripture, you are taken into God himself.”<a href="#sdfootnote14sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>14</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In other words, “there is no deeper reality of God lurking in the background” behind the three Persons of the Godhead.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>15</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although many of the disagreements took place before the distinction between the economic and immanent Trinity was formalized, the contours of the historical trinitarian debates revolve around where the conceptual boundary lies between the two.<a href="#sdfootnote16sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>16</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A concern for the preservation of God’s <em>unity</em> motivated many of the early controversies. For example, Paul of Samosata collapsed the immanent Trinity to the Father alone, pushing the Son and Spirit into the economy, in their respective relations to the human being Jesus and the apostles – the view known as adoptionism.<a href="#sdfootnote17sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>17</sup></span></a> Similarly, Sabellius pushed all three divine Persons into the economy, positing that the immanent Godhead was one God who exists in three modes or roles of being to the external creation – the view known as modalism.<a href="#sdfootnote18sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>18</sup></span></a> </span><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, it was Arius’s commitment to monotheism that led him to shrink the immanent Trinity down to the Father alone – concluding that, because God is the indivisible cause of all that exists, he must have existed prior to the Son, who is “not everlasting or co-everlasting or unbegotten with the Father.”<a href="#sdfootnote19sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>19</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although each of these views would ultimately find condemnation in the creeds of the Church, it was Arius’s conception of a created Son that ignited the controversy that led to the Council of Nicaea (325), which refuted Arianism by declaring that the Son is “begotten, not made, being of one substance [<em>homoousios</em>] with the Father.”<a href="#sdfootnote20sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>20</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the trinitarian debates continued, in part because of the relative ambiguity of the term homoousios and the ability of different factions to interpret it as they wished.<a href="#sdfootnote21sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>21</sup></span></a> The years between the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople (381) were theologically chaotic as Athanasius of Alexandria and the Cappadocian fathers (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa) fought for the Nicene view of the Trinity against its detractors, Arian and otherwise.<a href="#sdfootnote22sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>22</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, along the lines of Arius’s original concerns, if the Son and the Spirit are granted full divinity along with the Father (as they are in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed), why do Christians confess one God and not three? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Gregory of Nyssa addressed these concerns first by appealing to the differences between the trinitarian terms <em>ousia</em> (common essence) and <em>hypostasis</em> (distinct personal subsistence). </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Belonging to the category of collective or common nouns – which unite by referring to the common nature shared by diverse members of the same category – <em>ousia</em> refers to the divine essence or substance, shared equally by the three <em>hypostases</em> of the Godhead so that they are properly <em>homoousioi</em>, or of the same substance, with one another.<a href="#sdfootnote23sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>23</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, belonging to the category of individual or proper nouns – which distinguish by referring to only one member of a particular category – <em>hypostasis</em> refers to the individual identity or subsistence of each divine Person which demarcates it from the other two.<a href="#sdfootnote24sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>24</sup></span></a> </span><span style="color: #000000;">The divine <em>hypostases</em> are distinguishable in that “the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are one in all things save in the being unbegotten [Father], the being begotten [Son], and the procession [Spirit].”<a href="#sdfootnote25sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>25</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The distinction between a common <em>ousia</em> and distinct <em>hypostases</em>, therefore, prevents the collapse of the Trinity, yet through a crucial difference between the distinction-in-unity with regard to humanity and with regard to the divine. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After all, it is difficult to ascertain the unifying <em>ousia</em> of humanity because the distinct <em>hypostases</em> both appear and behave in such discordant ways. Due to their myriad differences and a merely conceptual unity, humans are not properly referred to as one human but many. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In contrast, the unity of the three divine <em>hypostases</em> is actual, by virtue of the trinitarian rule <em>opera trinitatis ad extra indivisa sunt</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote26sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>26</sup></span></a> As Gregory of Nyssa notes, “every activity which pervades from God to creation and is named according to our manifold design starts off from the Father, proceeds through the Son, and is completed by the Holy Spirit.”<a href="#sdfootnote27sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>27</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Christians worship one God, because although each divine Person is God, “by the same proclamation God is one, because neither in regard to nature [or ousia] nor activity is any difference viewed.”<a href="#sdfootnote28sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>28</sup></span></a> Unlike the diverse and discordant human <em>hypostases</em>, the divine persons are completely unified in their will and operations. Therefore, in the words of Gregory of Nazianzus: “the Godhead exists undivided in beings divided.”<a href="#sdfootnote29sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>29</sup></span></a></span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000conclusionspan"><span style="color: #000000;">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To return to what was mentioned at the outset, the best discussions of the Trinity also <em>end</em> with an acknowledgment of its inherent mystery which eludes the grasp of human reason’s highest reach. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Theological modesty is always in order, in part because of the unavoidable limitations of finite human speech about <em>anything</em>, much less about the infinite God. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Granted, certain ways of framing how God can be one and yet three are better than others, not only based upon their coherence with the traditions of orthodoxy, but also with regard to their impact on other areas of theological concern – such as the atonement and interpersonal relationships.<a href="#sdfootnote30sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>30</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And yet, because true theology is not learning how to speak about God in order to master him intellectually, but in order to worship him faithfully, a persistent lacuna in trinitarian understanding is surely acceptable. For, although the gracious condescension of the triune God enables our faith to seek understanding successfully, the inscrutable mysteries of the same triune God ensure that some understandings will ever transcend our faith’s reach.</span></p>
<h1 id="-notes-">======== NOTES =========</h1>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote1anc">1</a> All dates CE, unless otherwise noted. Wainwright notes that the Niceno-Constantinopolitan creed “has remained the most widely affirmed statement of trinitarian faith in both East and West.” Geoffrey Wainwright, “Trinity” in <em>Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible</em> (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 815.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote2anc">2</a> The three terms in each of these two sets will be used synonymously throughout, unless otherwise noted. Substance = essence = ousia. Subsistence = person = hypostasis. Capitalized “Person” will refer to divine, and not human, personality.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote3anc">3</a> Rusch notes that the binitarian NT formulas are: Rom. 8:11; 2 Cor. 4:1; Gal. 1:1; Eph. 1:20; 1 Tim. 1:2; 1 Pet. 1:21; and 2 John 1:13. The trinitarian NT formulas are: Matt 28:19; 1 Cor. 6:11; 12:4ff.; Gal. 3:11-14; Heb. 10:29; 1 Pet. 1:2. William G. Rusch, trans./ed., <em>The Trinitarian Controversy</em> (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1980), 2. Without denying the importance of such passages, Jenson rightly laments those who “scrabble around in the Bible for bits and pieces of language to cobble together into a sort of Trinity-doctrine – usually with intellectually lamentable and indeed sometimes heretical results.” Robert W. Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” <em>CTQ</em> 68 (2004): 196.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote4anc">4</a> Jenson, 197. Emphasis original.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote5anc">5</a> Jenson, 199. The divinity of the Father is perhaps the easiest to note throughout the Bible. On the divinity of the Son, see John 1, 10; Col. 2; Phil. 2; and Heb. 1. On the divinity of the Spirit, see 1 Cor. 2:11; Heb. 3:7-10; and 10:15-17. I have here stuck to the contours of Jenson’s argument in lieu of the common arguments for the divinity of Son and Spirit, e.g.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote6anc">6</a> Jenson, 198-202. The phrase “dramatis personae Dei” is Jenson’s adaptation of Tertullian’s verbiage.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote7anc">7</a>Cf. John 5:16-23; Jenson, 199. Although this is almost assuredly an oversimplification, cf. Marshall’s claim that “the Father is the God of Israel, the Son is the God of Israel, and the Holy Spirit is the God of Israel, yet they are not three Gods of Israel, but one God of Israel.” B. Marshall, “Do Christians Worship the God of Israel” in <em>Knowing the Triune God</em> (ed. J. Buckley and D. Yeago; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001), 258; quoted by Wainwright, 817. However, Jenson’s main point still stands, by virtue of Jesus’ address to the Father establishing both Fatherhood and Sonship within the Trinity.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote8anc">8</a> Cf. Ps. 2:7; Heb. 1:1-14. In addition, Jenson (200-3) focuses on showing the presence of the Trinity in the OT, where it is so often neglected, by positing that the Son shows up via the themes of the angel of the Lord, the name of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord..</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote9anc">9</a>Jenson, 199, 204; cf. Gen. 1:2; Ps. 51:11; Isa. 11:2; Ezek. 37:1-14; John 14:15-31; Acts 1:7-8; 2:1-41; Rom. 1:4; 8:11.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote10anc">10</a> Rusch, 2. Gregory of Nazianzus captures the progressive nature of this scriptural trinitarian revelation well: “the old covenant made clear proclamation of the Father, a less definite one of the Son. The new covenant made the Son manifest, and gave us a glimpse of the Spirit’s Godhead. At the present time, the Spirit resides amongst us, giving us a clearer manifestation of himself than before.” See Gregory of Nazianzus, Fifth Theological Oration (Oration 31): On the Holy Spirit, 14, in <em>On God and Christ: The Five Theological Orations and Two Letters to Cledonius</em> (Popular Patristics Series 23; trans. Frederick Williams and Lionel Wickham; Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 2002), 26.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote11anc">11</a> Wainwright, 815.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote12anc">12</a> Jenson, 205; Wainwright, 815.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote13anc">13</a> Cf. Jesus’ “high priestly prayer” of John 17 and the glimpse of the relationship between Father and Son.</p>

<p><a href="#sdfootnote15anc">15</a> Jenson, 205.</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote16anc">16</a> That is, while the debates did not originally or chronologically take place in terms of “immanent/economic Trinity,” the concept provides a helpful analytical framework when considering the trinitarian controversies. .</p>
<p><a href="#sdfootnote17anc">17</a> Adoptionism is also known as “dynamic monarchianism.” Rusch, 8.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">As the first royal psalm of the Psalter, Psalm 2 exhorts rebellious world leaders to serve Yahweh in wisdom by submitting to his anointed Davidic king who has been granted a global kingdom.<a href="#sdfootnote1sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>1</sup></span></a> Comprehension of the psalm’s original message first requires an examination of its constituent parts, with an eye toward its poetic features and original context. Furthermore, an understanding of the enduring significance of Psalm 2 necessitates a consideration of its canonical and redemptive-historical context, including the New Testament’s typological interpretations of the passage. This essay will provide both aspects before concluding with a brief discussion of how best to interpret and apply Psalm 2 to the contemporary Christian Church. </span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Psalm 2 is arranged in four stanzas of three verses each that follow a loosely chiastic movement from the rebellious rulers of nations (2:1-3), to Yahweh (2:4-6), to his anointed king (2:7-9), and back to the rulers (2:10-12).<a href="#sdfootnote2sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>2</sup></span></a> The psalmist opens with a twofold rhetorical question that uses synthetic parallelism to express indignant astonishment at the nations’ rage (2:1a) and the peoples’ vain plots (2:1b).<a href="#sdfootnote3sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>3</sup></span></a> The rest of the first stanza clarifies the scene: the “kings” and “rulers” of the earth are rebelliously conspiring “against the Lord and against his Anointed” (2:2), using the metaphor of “bonds” and “cords” in their reported direct speech (2:3) to express comparatively the implied rule of the Israelite king.<a href="#sdfootnote4sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></a> The second stanza shifts the focus upward from the limited earthly sphere of influence of the rebellious kings to the unlimited heavenly kingdom of Yahweh (2:4), who anthropomorphically responds to their machinations with laughter and derision, “just as humans would mock something ridiculous.”<a href="#sdfootnote5sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>5</sup></span></a> As Ross notes, the two verbs “he will speak” and “[he will] terrify them” (2:5) are respectively a metonymy of cause and of effect to portray the full divine response, arranged in chiastic order (“speak + wrath // anger + terrify”) to emphasize God’s wrath.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>6</sup></span></a> At the heart of the passage’s chiastic structure, bridging the second and third stanzas, is a dramatic shift of scene from Yahweh speaking while seated in the heavens (2:4-6) to Mount Zion and the Davidic king’s recounting of the divine decree (2:7). Both divine speeches emphasize that the authority of Israel’s king proceeds from his divine installation and sonship.<a href="#sdfootnote7sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></a> As Mays notes, although the human ruler in view is not equal or identical to the deity, this unique appearance in the Psalter of “son” as the Davidic king’s title (cf. 2 Sam 7:14) reveals the close correspondence between God and the king.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>8</sup></span></a> This powerful polemic against the rulers who would dare to rebel against such an authoritative king continues through the third stanza (2:7-9), where the son/king is granted a global kingdom (2:8), described with synonymous parallelism between (1) the “nations” and “ends of the earth” and (2) “your heritage” and “your possession.” The section concludes with a vivid image, utilizing “a rod of iron” as a metaphor for the Davidic king’s divinely-granted authority and “like a potter’s vessel” as a simile for the relative vulnerability of the rulers of nations sans divine installation and protection.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>9</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> In the final stanza (2:10-12), the psalmist appropriately begins with “now therefore,” a common phrase from Hebrew wisdom literature, before exhorting the rebellious kings and rulers of the earth to “be wise” (2:10) by serving the Lord in reverential fear (2:11) and submitting to his anointed son/king (2:12a).<a href="#sdfootnote10sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></a> The urgency of the exhortations is “met by the warning that <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">he</span></em> may be angry” (2:12b-c).<a href="#sdfootnote11sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>11</sup></span></a> The ambiguity of the subject (“he”) of the descriptions of anger in these two clauses serves to illustrate the close link between Yahweh and his king throughout the entire psalm. As Ross rightly notes, the result of either interpretive option would be the same – “the king will put down their rebellion, but it will be God giving him the victory. To rebel against the one is to rebel against both, and to submit to one is to submit to both.”<a href="#sdfootnote12sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>12</sup></span></a> The psalmist concludes by promising blessing to those who take refuge in “him” (2:12d) – an again ambiguous referent, but contextually describing those who demonstrate reverential faith for Yahweh by submitting to his anointed king.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>13</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Contextually, the parallels between this passage and the promises spoken to David in 2 Samuel 7:8-16 clarify the content by identifying the psalm with the coronation of a Davidic king, in addition to the Davidic covenant’s continuity with the other covenant commitments of Yahweh throughout the OT.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>14</sup></span></a> Despite Gunn’s creative proposal that Psalm 2 refers to the anointing and not the coronation of the king, Ross offers a balanced perspective when he views the psalm’s original occasion as a time of crisis due to the vulnerability of the nation to foreign attack at the time of a new king’s coronation.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>15</sup></span></a> Within the Psalter itself, Psalm 2 comprises an introduction along with Psalm 1 – focusing “on the victory of the LORD’s anointed king over the nations” after Psalm 1’s emphasis on the wise way of the righteous.<a href="#sdfootnote16sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>16</sup></span></a> Because the final editing and compilation of the Psalter took place in absence of a Davidic king, this fitting introduction “served as a reminder of God’s plan” to its earliest audiences.<a href="#sdfootnote17sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>17</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> However, as VanGemeren rightly emphasizes, “the juxtaposition of Psalm 3 [a Davidic lament psalm] with Psalms 1 and 2 creates a sense of dissonance” which refocuses “the hope of the godly from David to the Lord, who has made the promises to David.”<a href="#sdfootnote18sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>18</sup></span></a> That is, the tension between the idealized portraits (of the individual and Davidic king) in the first two Psalms, the “canonical understanding of the failure of David and of the Davidic dynasty,” and the “real world of failure and exile” experienced throughout the rest of the Psalter and Hebrew Bible encourages a christological and eschatological reading – one which looks for the fulfillment of the expectations of Israel and David in a coming anointed king who is both Son of David and Son of God.<a href="#sdfootnote19sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>19</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor000000enduring-significancespan"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Enduring Significance</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">It is reasonable to assume that Psalm 2’s uniqueness as the only psalm to use “son” as a title for the Davidic king and the only OT combination of “anointed/messiah,” “king,” and “son” in one passage contributed to its frequent use in the NT.<a href="#sdfootnote20sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>20</sup></span></a> The redemptive-historical context of the second psalm suggests its meaningful relevance (1) during the Hebrew monarchy when a Davidic king was on the throne, (2) during the post-exilic absence of a king, and (3) as the psalm’s circle of context extended into the New Testament and the nascent Church – taking on a typological significance in its portrayal of the anointed Davidic king as the <em>type</em> of which Jesus the Messiah was the <em>antitype</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote21sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>21</sup></span></a> Based on the NT evidence, as VanGemeren notes, “from the perspective of typology, Jesus is the fulfillment of the psalm,” because “he is born of David’s lineage (Mt 1:1; Lk 2:4, 11), has a right to David’s throne (Lk 1:32), is the Son of God in a unique way (Mt 3:17; Lk 9:35; Heb 1:5), and will ultimately subdue all enemies under his feet (1Co 15:25-27; Heb 2:5-8).”<a href="#sdfootnote22sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>22</sup></span></a> Although a full discussion of messianic typological interpretation exceeds the purview of this paper, a discussion of the quotations of Psalm 2 in Acts 4:25-26 and twice in Hebrews (1:5 and 5:5) will suffice to demonstrate the NT sensitivity to the contours of God’s redemptive mission and the uniqueness of his Messiah – an awareness which contemporary interpretative methods should embody.<a href="#sdfootnote23sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>23</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Following the reprimand and release of Peter and John from the Sanhedrin (Acts 4:1-23), the believers to whom they are reunited quote Psalm 2:1-2 (Acts 4:25-26) as they confess to God (4:24) a poignant interpretation of the resistance the anointed king of Psalm 2 faced from the “Gentiles,” “peoples,” “kings,” and “rulers” (4:25-26) in terms of the lethal opposition Jesus received from “Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel” (4:27). Of note is the intimate awareness of not only the content but also the eschatological bent of Psalm 2 that such a typological interpretation of the text required. In a profound interpretive dialectic, familiarity with the passage’s unmet expectations, the patterns of God’s redemptive work, and the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus enabled these believers to bring Psalm 2 to bear on the very resistance their messianic interpretations were creating for themselves.<a href="#sdfootnote24sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>24</sup></span></a> Because Psalm 2 teaches that “the declaration of the Son of God is God’s answer to the opposition of the world’s powers,” the early Christians used the passage to bolster their proclamation of the gospel in the face of external threats, not by directly identifying themselves with Psalm 2’s Davidic king, but by taking refuge in him, so to speak, by proclaiming their experience of the passage’s unique fulfillment in the person of Jesus and trusting in Yahweh’s promised blessing (Ps 2:12).<a href="#sdfootnote25sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>25</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The uniqueness of Jesus’ fulfillment of the second psalm is further accentuated in the quotation of Psalm 2:7 at Hebrews 1:5a and 5:5. The former quotation follows immediately after the introduction to the epistle (1:1-4), and is paired with a quotation of 2 Samuel 7:14 (Heb 1:5b) in order to emphasize the Son’s superiority to the angels, a theme which is then carried forward through a litany of OT quotations which collectively emphasize the same point.<a href="#sdfootnote26sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>26</sup></span></a> The latter occurrence of Psalm 2:7 (Heb 5:5) is the first use of an OT passage in the lengthy central discussion of the priesthood of Christ in Hebrews 5:1-10:18, explaining his appointment as high priest in terms of his divine sonship – with an emphasis on the humility of one who “did not exalt himself,” (5:5a) but rather was installed by God. In answer to those who would overlook the Son’s unique status, both uses of Psalm 2:7 together emphasize that “the same one who exalted the Son above the angels (Heb. 1:5) has also glorified him to become high priest (5:1-9).”<a href="#sdfootnote27sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>27</sup></span></a> Significantly, the typological use of Psalm 2 in terms of Jesus Christ’s fulfillment as antitype coheres with the central point of the passage in its original context: the indissoluble link between Yahweh and his anointed son/king.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> The interpretation of Psalm 2 in the contemporary Christian context should demonstrate the same sensitivity the NT does to the contours of God’s redemptive mission and the uniqueness of his Messiah. This does not denigrate the passage’s relevance to Christians today, but rather guards against identifying oneself with the king of Psalm 2 and usurping the uniqueness of God’s Son in the desire for authority, blessing, and protection. Although Klein, Blomberg, and Hubbard claim that “royal psalms [such as Psalm 2] relate best to the modern counterparts of Israel’s kings: the leaders of the Christian community,” this approach, seems to risk a gross misinterpretation of the passage if Christian leaders fail to show due concern for the uniqueness of Jesus as the passage’s fulfillment.<a href="#sdfootnote28sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>28</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"> Instead, interpretations of Psalm 2 best emphasize the “crucial inherent differences between monarchs and church leaders” when they cohere with the passage’s original exhortation to demonstrate wisdom by submitting to God’s authoritative and anointed king.<a href="#sdfootnote29sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>29</sup></span></a> This is a warning to those who rebel against God by neglecting the authority of his anointed king – either by spurning him or, perhaps even more dangerously, by trying to take his place.<a href="#sdfootnote30sym"><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>30</sup></span></a> Christian leaders need to heed this warning just as much as anyone else. And yet Psalm 2 is simultaneously an encouraging comfort to those who follow Jesus the Messiah as the King of Kings, especially in times of fierce opposition when the future of God’s mission seems most vulnerable. The promised global kingdom (Ps 2:8-9) will one day be fully given to the Son of David who is the Son of God – and although the rulers of this world will continue to rise up against Yahweh and his king, those who take refuge in the Son (and therefore in Yahweh himself) will still receive the promised blessing (Ps 2:12) as faithful citizens of the Son’s kingdom.</span></p>

<div id="sdfootnote1"><span style="color:#000000;">[<span style="color:#000000;">1</span>](#sdfootnote1anc) All consulted commentators classify Psalm 2 as a royal psalm, the first example of their remarkable agreement throughout the passage.

For the Wisdom use of “now therefore,” see Prov 5:7; 7:24; 8:32. For kissing as a sign of “homage and submission,” see 1 Sam 10:1; 1 Kgs 19:18; cf. Craigie, *Psalms*, 68. Finally, for a discussion of the phrase “kiss the Son” as the *crux interpretum* of the passage at hand, see the discussions in Craigie, *Psalms*, 64, fn. 12.a; and VanGemeren, *Psalms*, 97-8, fn. 12. I agree with Ross when he notes that “in addressing leaders of other countries where Aramaic was spoken, using the Aramaic word \[for “son”\] made sense.” Ross, *Psalms*, 198-9, fn. 6.</span>

</div><div id="sdfootnote14"><span style="color:#000000;">[<span style="color:#000000;">14</span>](#sdfootnote14anc) Craigie, *Psalms*, 64. The Davidic covenant of 2 Sam 7 stands in elaborating continuity with the Abrahamic (Gen 12-17) and Mosaic (Exod 19-24) covenants, and is itself intensified and elaborated upon in the “new covenant” of Jer 31. This context of covenantal continuity is extremely important to the interpretation of Ps 2 because, without it, Yahweh’s exclusive, close relationship with the king (Ps 2:4-12) is inexplicable.</span>
</div><div id="sdfootnote15"><span style="color:#000000;">[<span style="color:#000000;">15</span>](#sdfootnote15anc) Ross, *Psalms*, 200. <span style="font-size:small;">VanGemeren rightly notes that “any attempt to link the psalm with an actual coronation of a Judean king…finds little support in the text.” VanGemeren, </span><span style="font-size:small;">*Psalms*</span><span style="font-size:small;">, 89. </span>Gunn’s proposal, while heeding VanGemeren’s caution and offering a creative explanation of the already-not-yet dimensions of Jesus Christ’s current kingly reign, seems more driven by the concerns of a presupposed eschatological system than by a straightforward exegesis of the passage at hand. Although the gap between David’s anointing as king (1 Sam 16) and his coronation as such (2 Sam 2, 5) is instructive for considerations of the Hebrew monarchy, it does not mean that such a gap was normative for the kingly sons of David for whom the psalm at hand was probably composed. Furthermore, there are other, better ways to explain the unique kingdom reign of Christ during the current age than this kind of artificial reverse interpretation of Psalm 2. See Gunn, “Psalm 2,” 431-2.</span>

Mays, *Psalms*, 40,7. According to the *UBS Greek New Testament*, 4<sup>th</sup> Rev. Ed. (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2001) 887,95, Psalm 2 is quoted in the NT at Acts 4:25-26 (Ps 2:1-2); 13:33; Heb 1:5, and 5:5 (Ps 2:7). Furthermore, there are allusions and verbal parallels to Psalm 2 at Mt 3:17; 17:5; Mk 1:11; 9:7; Lk 3:22; 9:35; Jn 1:49 (Ps 2:7); Heb 1:2 (Ps 2:8); Rev 11:18 (Ps 2:1); and 19:19 (Ps 2:2). Gunn notes that “based on New Testament quotations, allusions, and verbal parallels, Psalm 2 is one of the most frequently referred to of all the psalms.” Gunn, “Psalm 2,” 427.</span>

Hubbard, Jr., *Introduction to Biblical Interpretation*, Rev. Ed. (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2004) 183.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple relevant excerpts (given recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/10/22/down-with-the-pacifists/&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;) from “Violence and Peace,” the final chapter of Miroslav Volf’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Exclusion-Embrace-Theological-Exploration-Reconciliation/dp/0687002826&#34;&gt;Exclusion and Embrace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (my emphasis added in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;; paragraph breaks added where noted):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God will judge, not because God gives people what they deserve, but &lt;strong&gt;because some people refuse to receive what no one deserves; if evildoers experience God’s terror, it will not be because they have done evil, but because they have resisted to the end the powerful lure of the open arms of the crucified Messiah&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple relevant excerpts (given recent <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/10/22/down-with-the-pacifists/">posts</a>) from “Violence and Peace,” the final chapter of Miroslav Volf’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exclusion-Embrace-Theological-Exploration-Reconciliation/dp/0687002826">Exclusion and Embrace</a></em> (my emphasis added in <strong>bold</strong>; paragraph breaks added where noted):</p>
<p>“God will judge, not because God gives people what they deserve, but <strong>because some people refuse to receive what no one deserves; if evildoers experience God’s terror, it will not be because they have done evil, but because they have resisted to the end the powerful lure of the open arms of the crucified Messiah</strong>.</p>
<p>“If we accept the stubborn irredeemability of some people, do we not end up with an irreconcilable contradiction at the heart of Christian faith? Here the “crucified Messiah” with arms outstretched embracing the “vilest sinner,” there the Rider on the white horse with a sharp sword coming from his mouth to strike down the hopelessly wicked? The patient love of God over against the fury of God’s wrath? Why this polarity? [Paragraph break added]</p>
<p>“Not because the God of the cross is different from the God of the second coming. After all, the cross is not forgiveness pure and simple, but God’s <em>setting aright the world of injustice and deception</em>. The polarity is there because some human beings refuse to be “set aright.” <strong>Those who take divine suffering (the cross) as a display of divine weakness that condones violence — instead of divine grace that restores the violator — draw upon themselves divine anger (the sword) that makes an end to their violence.</strong> [Paragraph break added]</p>
<p>“The violence of the Rider on the white horse, I suggest, is the <em>symbolic portrayal of the final exclusion of everything that refuses to be redeemed by God’s suffering love</em>. For the sake of the peace of God’s good creation, we can and must affirm *this divine anger and <em>this</em> divine violence, while at the same time <strong>holding on to the hope that in the end, even the flag bearer will desert the army that desires to make war against the Lamb.</strong>” (pp. 298-299)</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“The thesis about the correspondence between divine and human action rightly underlines that the fundamental theological question in relation to violence is the question about God: “What is God like?” — the God who “loves enemies and is the original peace maker” (Yoder 1985, 104) or the God of vengeance, out to punish the insubordinate? The thesis has, however, one small but fatal flaw: <strong>humans are not God. There is a duty prior to the duty of imitating God, and that is the duty <em>of not wanting to be God</em>, of letting God be God and humans be humans. Without such a duty guarding the divinity of God the duty to imitate God would be empty because our concept of God would be nothing more than the mirror image of ourselves.</strong>” (301)</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past week has been a great one for slipshod attacks on pacifism. First, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firstthings.com/&#34;&gt;First Things&lt;/a&gt; (Stephen H. Webb) on October 15 —- &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/10/john-howard-yoder-and-the-violent-power-of-pacifism&#34;&gt;“John Howard Yoder and the Violent Power of Pacifism”&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis added below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nevertheless, pacifists, at least the ones I know, can be very enthusiastic about the rightness of their cause. Since &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;there is no rational justification for pacifism&lt;/span&gt;, defenders typically turn their rhetoric against their critics by casting them as stooges of the status quo. Since pacifists are against all forms of violence, anyone who disagrees with them must be in favor of violence. What this ploy misses is obvious. In a fallen world, not only is violence pervasive but it is also a toxin that, when legitimately used, can cure as well as kill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>“Nevertheless, pacifists, at least the ones I know, can be very enthusiastic about the rightness of their cause. Since <span style="text-decoration:underline;">there is no rational justification for pacifism</span>, defenders typically turn their rhetoric against their critics by casting them as stooges of the status quo. Since pacifists are against all forms of violence, anyone who disagrees with them must be in favor of violence. What this ploy misses is obvious. In a fallen world, not only is violence pervasive but it is also a toxin that, when legitimately used, can cure as well as kill.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“So we now know that [John Howard] Yoder was a violent man who believed so wholeheartedly in his own non-violent theology that he thought he could re-order human sexual relations. This single case does not invalidate pacifism, but it does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reveal just how delusional the pacifist goal can be. The pursuit of peace at all costs is just as dangerous as any other dream that cuts against the realities of human nature</span>.”</p>
<p>Exactly one week later, <a href="http://theresurgence.com/authors/mark-driscoll">Mark Driscoll</a> came out with this gem, <a href="http://theresurgence.com/2013/10/22/is-god-a-pacifist">“Is God a Pacifist?”</a>:</p>
<h2 id="jesus-is-not-a-pansy-or-a-pacifist"><strong>“JESUS IS NOT A PANSY OR A PACIFIST</strong></h2>
<p>“One of the defining attributes of God’s coming kingdom is <em>shalom</em>—perfect peace untainted by sin, violence, or bloodshed of any sort. Such a kingdom is only possible if an all-powerful, benevolent Authority vanquishes his enemies. In other words, the Prince of Peace is not a pacifist.</p>
<p>“God is the author of life and sovereign over death.</p>
<p>“Those who want to portray Jesus as a pansy or a pacifist are prone to be very selective in the parts of the Bible they quote. But the God of the bloody Old Testament is Jesus Christ. When he became a man, he walked the earth as a working-class carpenter. The European, long-haired, dress-wearing, hippie Jesus is a bad myth from a bad artist who mistook Jesus for a community college humanities professor. But if we want to learn all about Jesus we have to read all that the Bible says about him. Here’s how Jesus will appear one day:” [Proceeds to quote his favorite Bible passage, <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rev.%2014.14%E2%80%9320">Revelation 14:14-20</a>.]</p>
<p><strong>What about you? What’s your take on pacifism? And, if you’re going to critique it, please do a better job than Driscoll &amp; Co.!</strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The written Word of God is, therefore, the authority for followers of the living Word of God precisely because of its providential role in the divine speech-act, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>3</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Practically, this providential role has worked itself out in various ways throughout the history of the Church, perhaps most notably through the development of canon in the patristic era. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Theologically, the authority of Scripture is inescapably <strong>trinitarian</strong> in nature and <strong>ecclesiological</strong> in implication.</span></p>
<p>(For an explanation of the Trinity, see my essay “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/holy-trinity/">Trinity: What is it? (Why) Is it important?</a>“)</p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000what-scripture-is-for-christiansspan"><span style="color: #000000;">WHAT SCRIPTURE IS FOR CHRISTIANS</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For Christians, Scripture is the indispensable lens through which, with the Spirit’s illumination, we view Christ, who is himself the fullest lens through which we view the Godhead. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, the Bible is a vital link in the revelatory chain which includes Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and humanity. However, the Bible’s role <em>in</em> and <em>for</em> the Church is inescapably intertwined with (1) how the Bible came to be and (2) how it is properly to be accessed and interpreted.</span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000how-the-bible-came-to-bespan"><span style="color: #000000;">How the Bible Came to Be</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although the story of how the table of contents at the beginning of each Christian Bible came into existence is an old one, questions of <em>canon</em> in this sense did not arise immediately after Christ’s resurrection and ascension.<a href="#sdfootnote4sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The earliest Christians, persuaded that Jesus of Nazareth was the foretold Messiah of Israel, eagerly adopted the Hebrew Scriptures, or <em>Tanakh</em>, as their own Scripture. Apart from the Bible’s narrative of YHWH’s redemptive mission with his covenant people, the Christ-event (life, death, and resurrection) made little sense. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the other direction, however, the early Church believed that, as the fulfillment of the <em>Tanakh</em>, Christ himself was its true message. Put differently, the Hebrew Scriptures and the Son of God were considered reciprocally-interpretive, and this relationship was the first sense in which canon was considered as “the rule of truth”: the Christ-event and the Scriptures illuminate each other.<a href="#sdfootnote5sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>5</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The link between this earliest consideration of canon and the table-of-contents approach begins with the role proclamation and confession of the Son of God as the Bible’s true meaning – of the Gospel of Christ <em>according to the Scriptures</em> – have in creating the Church proper (cf. 1 Cor. 15:1-9).<a href="#sdfootnote6sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>6</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Because Christians are primarily interested in bringing people to faith in the faithful God through Christ, the proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Word of God constitutes the Church as the divinely-ordained way in which faith is brought about (cf. Rom. 10:17). To use a spatial metaphor, this ecclesial “point” of proclamation becomes a “line” throughout history by <em>tradition</em> as “the act of passing down” and “the content of what is passed down.”<a href="#sdfootnote7sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Church is thus formed by proclamation/confession of Jesus the Messiah according to the Scriptures, and preserved by tradition.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the second century C.E., Irenaeus of Lyons relied upon the connection between Scripture and apostolic tradition to refute Gnostic heresies which threatened to destabilize the Christian community by, among other things, insisting that Scripture could not be read at face value.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>8</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This connection was so strong that he referred to the “traditioned” teachings of the apostles as <em>in scripturis</em>, responding to those who accused these apostolic “Writings” of novel fiction by delineating the unity of Christian doctrine which had been passed down from the apostles (eyewitnesses of the Christ-event) to the Church through a clear line of bishops.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>9</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was of crucial importance to Irenaeus that Christian doctrine was (1) unified and (2) in direct continuity with the apostles’ teaching (and therefore with the proclamation of Christ and the Christologically-fulfilled expectations of the Hebrew Scriptures).<a href="#sdfootnote10sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thus the Gnostic controversies of the second century led to canonization in its second sense: the Church’s recognition/acknowledgment of writings which already had authority due to their coherence with the complex dialectic between Scripture, the Christ-event, the apostles, proclamation, and tradition.<a href="#sdfootnote11sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>11</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Canon’s final sense, as a list of included and excluded books which comprise the Bible, came into being in the fourth century. The Church’s recognition of already authoritative writings culminated in C.E. 367 with the <em>Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle</em> of Athanasius – the first canon list to include “all, and nothing but, all [sic] the books of our New Testament.”<a href="#sdfootnote12sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>12</sup></span></a></span></p>
<h2 id="span-stylecolor-000000scriptures-proper-interpretation-and-rolespan"><span style="color: #000000;">Scripture’s Proper Interpretation and Role</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In interacting with the Word of God, it is imperative that the people of God resist the impulse to jump behind the text – either to a Gnostic-inspired and disembodied spiritual narrative, or to historical criticism’s rationalistic insistence on verifiable facts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Properly handled, the Bible results in the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in order to produce faith in the faithful God.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Arguably, the best interpretive method accounts for both Christ as the fullest truth of Scripture and the varied ways in which the Bible has been used by God through his Spirit to accomplish his redemptive mission in manifold ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, in terms of my thesis above, the best biblical hermeneutic accounts for both the central locution (Christ) and the varied perlocutionary effects accomplished in/through the Church by the Spirit throughout history.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It does not leave Christ behind in its insistence on esoteric behind-the-text matters, nor does it refuse the Spirit its right to bring the written Word to bear on the interpreter’s present context in fresh ways. In this way, interpretation of the Bible leads to faith through the faithful proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Scriptures.</span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000scriptures-own-authorityspan"><span style="color: #000000;">SCRIPTURE’S OWN AUTHORITY</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As mentioned above, Scripture’s authority comes from its providential role in the speech-act of God, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That is, although the illocutionary acts of the Bible are an indispensable link in the revelatory chain, they do not comprise the entire chain. Any discussion of Scripture’s authority must, therefore, take place with its discursive context in mind, by including a discussion of the Christological locution and Spirit-empowered, ecclesiological perlocutionary effects of the divine speech-act.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Christologically, the illocutionary acts of the written Word of God bear witness to Christ the living Word as their central meaning: the ultimate locution of God. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Jesus himself never shied away from claiming that he was the fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures (Matt. 5:17; Lk. 24:25-27, 44). Indeed, he chastised the Jewish leaders for thoroughly studying the Scriptures, yet failing to see that the <em>Tanakh</em> bore witness to him (John 5:39-40)! </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Likewise, in Acts, Peter (3:11-26), Stephen (7:1-53), and Paul (13:16-41) all portray Christ as the fulfillment of YHWH’s previous interactions with Israel in the <em>Tanakh</em>. The written Word of God is authoritative in that it bears witness to the Living Word as the zenith of God’s redemptive revelation – the “image of the invisible God” in whom “the fulness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col. 1:15, 19, ESV).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When the Bible speaks of its own authority, it never does so apart from the life of the faithful, the Church. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The two favorite passages for the inspiration (and often, the inerrancy) of Scripture both refuse to reduce the Bible to a set of propositions to be debated within a correspondence theory of truth. The Scriptures were “breathed out by God,” not to be profitable for scientific analysis, but for “reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16, ESV). Furthermore, “men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit,” (2 Pet. 1:21, ESV) for the sake of the people of God, that they might know Christ (2 Pet. 1:12-21). Arguably, then, the ties between inspiration and sanctification are stronger than those between inspiration and certain common notions of inerrancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At this intersection between the inspired illocutionary acts of Scripture and their perlocutionary effects lies the Spirit of God, who empowers the “inscripturate” Word to become “incardiate,” or “taken to heart” by God’s people.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>13</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Pneumatologically, then, the Bible is able both to <em>be</em> and <em>become</em> the Word of God, as its written words are used in various ways by the Spirit throughout the ages to effect God’s mission of redemption <em>in</em> and <em>through</em> his people.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>14</sup></span></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The christological, ecclesiological, and pneumatological elements of the divine speech-act thus enable the written Word continually to be an indispensable part of divine discourse, instead of a merely static word.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym"><span style="color: #000000;"><sup>15</sup></span></a></span></p>
<h1 id="span-stylecolor-000000conclusionspan"><span style="color: #000000;">CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout the ages, God has used his Word – living and written – to do everything from creating the world, to redeeming it; from calling a people, to establishing orthodoxy and orthopraxy in his Church; from inspiring reformation, to drawing people from every tribe, tongue, and nation to himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In order best to appropriate the written Word of God and submit to its continuing authority in their lives, the people of God should focus on proclaiming its central message as the Gospel of Jesus Christ and allowing the Holy Spirit to accomplish fresh perlocutionary effects <em>in</em> and <em>through</em> them as God’s redemptive mission moves toward its consummation – when the written Word of God will be in their hearts and the living Word of God in front of their faces, forever (Jer. 31:33-34; Rev. 21-22).</span></p>

<div id="sdfootnote1">[1](#sdfootnote1anc) Unless otherwise noted, I use the terms “Son of God,” “Jesus,” “Christ/Messiah,” and permutations thereof interchangeably. The same applies to “Scripture” and “Bible.”
</div><div id="sdfootnote2">[2](#sdfootnote2anc) I here adopt J.L. Austin’s speech-act theory, as put forth in How to Do Things with Words (2nd ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975). Briggs offers the following helpful summary: “Austin sought to distinguish between the act performed in saying something and the act performed by saying something, labeling these ‘illocutionary’ and ‘perlocutionary’ acts respectively.” See Richard S. Briggs, “Speech-Act Theory” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 763. I am also heavily indebted to Kevin J. Vanhoozer, “Word of God” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 850-4.
</div><div id="sdfootnote3">[3](#sdfootnote3anc) Theologically modifying Austin’s framework, the “divine speech-act” consists of God the Father (locutor), God the Son (locution), Scripture (illocutionary act), and God the Spirit (who fulfills the perlocutionary effects).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Read Scot McKnight’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-King-Jesus-Gospel-Revisited/dp/031049298X&#34;&gt;The King Jesus Gospel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Check out Tim Gombis’ insightful series of posts on &lt;a href=&#34;http://timgombis.com/2013/09/16/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom/&#34;&gt;The Gospel of the Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, pt. &lt;a href=&#34;http://timgombis.com/2013/09/16/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://timgombis.com/2013/09/17/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom-pt-2/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://timgombis.com/2013/09/18/the-gospel-of-the-kingdom-pt-3/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gombis hits the nail on the head here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Gombis hits the nail on the head here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gospel is more than a checklist, more than a five-minute “yes-or-no” conversation in which you can make a new Christian… its a narrative of cosmic significance. If God really is reconciling <em><strong>all things</strong></em> to himself in and through Jesus Christ, then everything we do and say, ESPECIALLY when we’re speaking of the Gospel, must change.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rachel and I are in the middle of our second month of calling Birmingham, Alabama “home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we could both do with a little less humidity (!), we’re enjoying ourselves and our surroundings down here in Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-happening-in-birmingham-al&#34;&gt;What’s Happening in Birmingham, AL:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t start my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/masterofdivinity&#34;&gt;M.Div.&lt;/a&gt; coursework at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/&#34;&gt;Beeson Divinity School&lt;/a&gt; until late August, but I’ve already started working at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beesondivinity.com/mediacenter&#34;&gt;Beeson’s Media Center&lt;/a&gt; (follow our nascent &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeesonMedia&#34;&gt;Twitter account here&lt;/a&gt;). It’s an incredibly convenient on-campus job. I’m already thankful for the hospitality of my boss and coworkers. It’s helpful as I learn the ropes of AV, IT, and sundry other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="whats-happening-in-birmingham-al">What’s Happening in Birmingham, AL:</h2>
<p>I don’t start my <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/masterofdivinity">M.Div.</a> coursework at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a> until late August, but I’ve already started working at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/mediacenter">Beeson’s Media Center</a> (follow our nascent <a href="https://twitter.com/BeesonMedia">Twitter account here</a>). It’s an incredibly convenient on-campus job. I’m already thankful for the hospitality of my boss and coworkers. It’s helpful as I learn the ropes of AV, IT, and sundry other tasks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547848412"><img loading="lazy" src="http://indiereader.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/life-of-pi.jpg" alt=""  />
</a>Before diving into my required reading for the Fall, I’ve been working my way through a few books so far this summer. On the fiction side of things, I heartily recommend <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547848412">Life of Pi</a></em> by Yann Martel.</p>
<p>Even more so, however, I strongly recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/pennerm">Myron Bradley Penner</a>‘s <em><a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/the-end-of-apologetics/285611">The End of Apologetics: Christian Witness in a Postmodern Context</a></em> to anyone and everyone interested in philosophy, religion, and theology. I plan on devoting a series of posts to a discussion of Penner’s work. For now, suffice it to say the following: This book has already been a godsend in my contemplation of how best to advance God’s Kingdom. (Academically, pastorally, and globally, as I’d say.) Especially in the midst of postmodernity.</p>
<p><a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/the-end-of-apologetics/285611"><img loading="lazy" src="http://assets.bakerpublishinggroup.com/processed/books/covers/original/9781441251091.jpg?1372396212" alt=""  />
</a>Again, I’ll have more to say about Penner’s book in later posts, but to whet your appetite, allow me to point you toward Peter Enns’ interview with Penner: “<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/06/is-christian-apologetics-secular-and-unbiblical-an-interview-with-myron-penner/">Is Christian Apologetics Secular and Unbiblical?</a>” Also, Sarah Jones’ post, “<a href="http://anthonybsusan.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/tony-jones-and-the-need-for-a-postcolonial-christianity/">Tony Jones and the Need for a Postcolonial Christianity</a>” came to mind several times while reading <em>The End of Apologetics</em>. Definitely worth a read!</p>
<p>Finally, my current project is reading <a href="http://www.nai.uu.se/research/researchers/terje-oestigaard/">Terje Oestigaard’s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Water-Christianity-Capitalism-Terje-Oestigaard/dp/1780760663"><em>Water, Christianity and the Rise of Capitalism</em></a> to review for<a href="http://www.hope.ac.uk/theologicalbookreview/"> Liverpool Hope University’s <em>Theological Book Review</em></a>. It’s definitely further away from my comfort zone than the <a href="http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/from-paradise-to-the-promised-land-3rd-edition/230932">Pentateuch textbook</a> I’ve reviewed previously, but hey, I’m trying to branch out. Stay tuned for my feedback.</p>

      <description>&lt;address&gt;Update (April 2017): I’ve gone back to update/clean-up the formatting in this wonderful June 2013 guest post on the basics of inductive Bible study from my friend **Amy Elizabeth Chase Ashley,** one of the most gifted students of Scripture with whom I’ve been privileged to study. She blogs at &lt;https://amyechase.wordpress.com/&gt;. &lt;/address&gt;---
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jeremiah-2911&#34;&gt;Jeremiah 29:11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I accepted the invitation to speak at my parents’ church, I immediately started thinking about what message I would deliver. I decided to give a message on something that is very important to me after my four years at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/&#34;&gt;Cedarville&lt;/a&gt; and something I am very passionate about. I hope it will be &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;engaging&lt;/span&gt;; I hope it will &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;make you think&lt;/span&gt;; and I hope it will &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;bring glory to God&lt;/span&gt;. If I can accomplish those three things, I will be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="jeremiah-2911">Jeremiah 29:11</h2>
<p>When I accepted the invitation to speak at my parents’ church, I immediately started thinking about what message I would deliver. I decided to give a message on something that is very important to me after my four years at <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/">Cedarville</a> and something I am very passionate about. I hope it will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">engaging</span>; I hope it will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make you think</span>; and I hope it will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bring glory to God</span>. If I can accomplish those three things, I will be satisfied.</p>
<p>The Scripture I chose is Jeremiah 29:11 and I’m guessing that most Christians could recite the verse from memory. If not, once you read it, you’ll probably remember or recognize it.</p>
<p><em><strong>“’For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.’”</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a familiar verse for a lot of Christians. My question today is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether it should be</span>.</p>
<p>This might seem like a strange question, but I think you’ll understand what I mean soon.</p>
<p>So why is this verse so familiar to us? Well, it’s used a lot. Are you nervous about future uncertainties? <em>Jeremiah 29:11</em>. Are you starting a new job?  <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Graduating from high school or college? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> That teenage girl had her boyfriend break up with her? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Car trouble that makes you late to work? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em> Lost your lucky pencil? <em>Jeremiah 29:11.</em></p>
<p>I hope you’re catching my sarcasm.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://rlv.zcache.com/jeremiah_29_11_i_know_the_plans_bible_verse_denim_keychain-r143db7130dbe4fb3a239db30a4aeef88_x7j3z_8byvr_512.jpg" alt=""  />
And maybe you think I’m exaggerating. But I did a Google search for Jeremiah 29:11 and you can buy folders, clocks, plaques, keychains, mugs, pictures, bumper stickers, aprons, tote bags, iPhone cases, tshirts, pillows, bracelets, and even playing cards that have this verse on them. It might be rivaling the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023&amp;version=NET">23rd Psalm</a> after all that. And I know for a fact that it can be found on countless greeting cards whether they be sympathy, graduation, engagement, or congratulatory cards.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/this-is-not-a-bag-of-trail-mix-you-cant-just-pick-out-the-p.png" alt="- this is not a bag of trail mix you cant just pick out the p"  />
</p>
<p>I saw a meme on the internet the other day. It was an image of the Bible, and the text said: “This is not a bag of trail mix. You can’t just pick out the pieces you like and ignore the rest.” I’m afraid that the widespread use of Jeremiah 29:11 demonstrates a bigger problem: we really are guilty of treating the Bible like a bag of trail mix. Jeremiah 29:11 is an M&amp;M that we pull out time and time again while we ignore all the peanuts and raisins and cashews and granola all around it.</p>
<p>Christians claim to have a high view of Scripture—that is, we say that the Bible is the authoritative, divinely inspired Word of God. We are quick to use it to tell the world what they’re doing wrong whether that be gay marriage or murder or how to raise children. We say that we live by what the Bible says, but I’m afraid that we’re often guilty of not even knowing what the Bible says. For me, the widespread use of Jeremiah 29:11 proves this.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, does anyone know what Jeremiah 29:10 says? No, because it’s a peanut. Jeremiah 29:12? Sorry, I don’t like raisins. But I am feeling uncertain about this new job/relationship/house/baby/friend/responsibility/accomplishment/etc., so I like to be told that God has good plans for me. I like to imagine him saying, “I know the plans I have for you…”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://nourish.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/trail-mix-nancy-mueller.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Okay, not to be harsh, but <strong>the Bible isn’t supposed to be about us.</strong> It’s actually not about us at all and it’s high time we quit acting like it’s a self-help book or a book full of timeless, ready-to-be-applied principles. It takes study—actual study—and hard work to read and understand the Bible and what God is saying to us. And if any book in the world is worthy of our time and energy and study, it’s got to be the Bible. But we so often pretend like it’s not.</p>
<p>Now, let me stop real quick and make sure you’re not hearing me say something I’m not. I’m not saying that the Bible isn’t applicable to you and your life. It is. <strong>But most of the Bible is not written to be timelessly applied to anyone, anywhere.</strong> The book of Romans was written to people who lived in Rome during the 1st century, not to people in America in 2013. Genesis was written for the Jewish people wandering in the desert and then entering the Holy Land during the time of Moses and Joshua, not for the people of your church. And Jeremiah, where this particular verse comes from? Well, we’ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>Now there are two doctrines that I want to highlight before I go any farther to make sure I express fully how Scripture should be applied to our lives. One is the doctrine of <strong>inspiration</strong> and the other is the doctrine of <strong>perspicuity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>First, the doctrine of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inspiration</span> means that <strong>the Bible is a divine product</strong>: it is inspired by God. God worked through the process of the composition and preservation of the books of the Bible. Therefore, yes, they were kind of written <em>for</em> us, but that’s different than them being written <em>to</em> us. God knew we would be reading Genesis someday, but Moses didn’t. And so the words that Moses wrote, although inspired by God, are not written to believers in the 21st century. When Paul wrote Romans, it never crossed his mind that Amy Chase from Ohio would be reading and studying them in 2013. So even though God inspired Paul to write and to write things that would remain applicable to people in 2013, Paul wasn’t intending to do that.</p>
<h2 id="perspicuity">Perspicuity</h2>
<p>The next doctrine is that of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perspicuity</span> of Scripture. Perspicuity is just a fancy word for “<strong>clear</strong>.” (Biblical scholars love fancy words for things.) Basically, the biblical text can be clearly understood by the ordinary reader. Someone can pick up the Bible and read it and understand it. It’s not gibberish. Anyone who can read can read the gospel accounts and understand that the story is about Jesus the Messiah, coming to earth, dying on a cross, and rising from the dead.</p>
<p>So, yes, you can pick up the Bible and “just read it.” And you do have, as a believer, the Holy Spirit helping you and guiding you. <strong>But the Holy Spirit is not, I believe, a big fan of laziness.</strong> He’s ready to help and guide you, but there are some things, like the geographic position of Jerusalem or the historical situation that caused Paul to write to the Romans, that he’s not going to be able to inspire in you. Well, he could, but that would be strange. Imagine if you just woke up tomorrow and could draw a detailed map of Israel, having never studied it. It’d be kind of like cheating, especially since that’s an assignment I had to do a lot of studying to be able to do. It’s a little like a parent helping a child with homework. If my mom had done my math homework for me, it wouldn’t have done me any good. But she did help me connect the dots and understand what I was supposed to be doing to get the right answer. <strong>The Holy Spirit will help you understand the Bible, but he’s not going to just read it for you and then inspire in your some kind of otherworldly, enlightened understanding.</strong> You will have to exert some effort. The knowledge is there for you, but you have to learn it.</p>
<p>At Cedarville, I majored in Bible and one of the very first things we were taught to do was to interpret Scripture well and then to be aware of when someone wasn’t. And, at Cedarville, when a chapel speaker or someone else mentions Jeremiah 29:11, all the Bible majors groan. It’s because Jeremiah 29:11 was the go-to verse that professors used to show us how the Bible is mishandled. Like I joked above, we decide that the “<em>you</em>” in “<em>I know the plans I have for you</em>” is the person starting the new job or the person who has lost their lucky pencil. Does God have good plans for your life? Yes, absolutely. But this isn’t the verse to prove it. And it certainly isn’t the verse to put on a graduation card. Let me explain why.</p>

<h2 id="inductive-bible-study-7-steps-to-study-the-bible">Inductive Bible Study: 7 Steps to Study the Bible</h2>
<p>But first, let me say a couple things about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">process</span> I’ll be using. At Cedarville, everyone takes certain classes and in one such class we were taught Bible study method, in particular, the <strong><em>inductive Bible study</em>.</strong> It’s a process by which anyone—and I mean anyone—can come to an educated understanding of what a passage is saying. I can do it, my grandma can do it, pastors can do it, and my 5th grade cousin can do it.</p>
<h3 id="step-one-survey-reading-and-historical-background">Step One: Survey Reading and Historical Background.</h3>
<p>Want to know what Jeremiah 29:11 means? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Read Jeremiah.</em></span> Okay, that’s a really long book. Sorry. Take that up with Jeremiah or God, I guess. Want to understand 1 Corinthians 13, the love chapter? Read 1 Corinthians. Want to understand John 3:16? Read John. Now, I’m not saying to study the whole thing to every minute detail, just read it. You can read it quickly even. Hey, college students know: a lot of assignments that are assigned to be “read” can be “skimmed.” I’m not suggesting we slack when reading the Bible, but you as long as you’re getting an idea of the book and what is being said, then you’re doing fine. Take a couple notes while you read: Who wrote the book? To whom? When? Why? What is the tone? What seems to be the big idea? What is each chapter about?</p>
<h3 id="step-two-unaided-observations">Step Two: Unaided Observations.</h3>
<p>Read the passage you want to study and understand. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Take notes.</span> When I did inductive studies for class, I had to do upwards of 10 observations per verse. To start, just aim for 3 or 4 per verse. They can be as simple as “Paul is making a statement here,” or “Jesus gives a command,” or “This verse switches from third person to first person.” They are called unaided because it’s just things you can come up with on your own. Things like repeated words and cause and effect statements are important to point out in your observations.</p>
<h3 id="step-three-interpretive-questions">Step Three: Interpretive Questions.</h3>
<p>After you make your observations, you’ll probably have some questions like, “Why did Paul say it that way?” or “What does this word mean?” If they’re questions you can’t answer on your own about your passage, that’s an interpretive question. Moving forward, it will be your goal to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">find an answer to your interpretive questions.</span> Try to come up with about five, but you can have as many as you want.</p>
<h3 id="step-four-word-studies">Step Four: Word Studies.</h3>
<p>All right, this is where it might seem to get complicated, but remember: I said that everyone could do this method. When we read the Bible, what we read is a translation. Although these translations are wonderful gifts for which we should be immensely grateful, they are also, unfortunately, a bit removed from the original. This means that some of the depth or nuance of the original might be lost without additional study.</p>
<p>Your Bible isn’t wrong, it’s just that the word in the original language might have more meaning than it’s possible for one English word to communicate. The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and the New Testament was originally written in Greek. So with word studies, we take an English word that is crucial in the verse and figure out what Hebrew or Greek word is was translated from.</p>
<h3 id="step-five-commentaries">Step Five: Commentaries.</h3>
<p>Say we’re working with John 3:16. What words might be counted as crucial? “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son…” There are lots of possibilities. It’s up to you to decide. Once you do that, there is a plethora of resources to help you see what the original word was and what meanings went along with it, and those resources are as close as your computer. The original word may encompass more or less than the English word. For example, using online resources, we see that the Greek word for “world” in John 3:16 is κοσμος with the meanings “the world, the universe, worldly affairs, the inhabitants of the world.” Sure, it might not be earth-shattering, but it’s an insight into the original language. And sometimes your findings may very well change how you read and understand a verse.</p>
<p>It’s just reading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what the experts have to say</span>. Commentaries will be the place where you’ll find answers to most of your interpretive questions. There are some very affordable commentaries out there and if you’re really looking to dig into a book of the Bible, buying one of two of them would be a great choice. Otherwise, there are a few online, but not the best ones. Libraries, Christian bookstores, and your church library would be good places to look. Not all commentaries are big, scary, technical books, and there are some that are very helpful and easy to read.</p>

<p>Look at everything you’ve done and figure out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what it all means together.</span> We were taught to come up with a “Big Idea” which basically says what the passage is about and what it says about what it is about. And, we stay away from any <em>here</em> and <em>now</em> language (talking about what it means for me and you) and use only <em>then</em> and <em>there</em> language (what it meant back then). So what is John 3:16 about? God sending his Son. What does it say about God sending his Son? That he did it because he loved the world and that believing in the Son is the way to everlasting life.</p>

<p>All right, until this point, we’ve avoided talking about ourselves. We’ve focused on what the author was saying to his intended audience. And, because of that, we should be able to figure out what the passage meant to the people it was written to originally. Now, to apply it, we need to figure out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what we have in common with that original audience.</span> If we are very similar, then we can apply it pretty directly, but if we are not, then the application will take a little more work and probably be a little more abstract.</p>

<h2 id="now-lets-go-back-to-my-beef-with-jeremiah-2911">Now, let’s go back to my beef with Jeremiah 29:11.</h2>
<p>Having done an inductive Bible study like I outlined for you, I’d like to explain why this is the verse my professors use to talk about misuse of the Bible. However, you don’t really have to go very far into the process. Let’s read <strong>Jeremiah 29:1-14:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The prophet Jeremiah sent a letter to the exiles Nebuchadnezzar had carried off from Jerusalem to Babylon. It was addressed to the elders who were left among the exiles, to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the other people who were exiled in Babylon. He sent it after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the palace officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had been exiled from Jerusalem. He sent it with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah. King Zedekiah of Judah had sent these men to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. The letter said:</p>
<p>‘The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says to all those he sent into exile to Babylon from Jerusalem, “Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what they produce. Marry and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons and allow your daughters get married so that they too can have sons and daughters. Grow in number; do not dwindle away. Work to see that the city where I sent you as exiles enjoys peace and prosperity. Pray to the Lord for it. For as it prospers you will prosper.”</p>
<p>‘For the Lord God of Israel who rules over all says, “Do not let the prophets or those among you who claim to be able to predict the future by divination deceive you. And do not pay any attention to the dreams that you are encouraging them to dream. They are prophesying lies to you and claiming my authority to do so. But I did not send them. I, the Lord, affirm it!”</p>
<p>‘For the Lord says, “Only when the seventy years of Babylonian rule are over will I again take up consideration for you. Then I will fulfill my gracious promise to you and restore you to your homeland. For I know what I have planned for you,” says the Lord. “I have plans to prosper you, not to harm you. I have plans to give you a future filled with hope. When you call out to me and come to me in prayer, I will hear your prayers. When you seek me in prayer and worship, you will find me available to you. If you seek me with all your heart and soul, I will make myself available to you,” says the Lord. “Then I will reverse your plight and will regather you from all the nations and all the places where I have exiled you,” says the Lord. “I will bring you back to the place from which I exiled you.”’”</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<p><strong>These people weren’t graduating from high school or starting a new job.</strong> Their country had been violently conquered by an outside force, the Temple destroyed, and they were carried off to a foreign country. They were questioning the faithfulness of God, feeling forsaken. Forsaken by God who had promised them the land they had been taken from, the land they had watched being destroyed. And now Jeremiah writes them a letter telling them that God wants them to know that <strong>they’ll be there a while</strong>.</p>
<p>But, because he loves them, God gives them a glimmer of <strong>hope</strong>: this is just a pause in the plans. He still plans to do good to them. But this is a punishment for their disobedience and they will pay the full cost. It’s hope in the midst of one of—if not the—darkest times in Israel’s history. So when we put Jeremiah 29:11 on a wedding card… Well, something just seems a little off to me.</p>
<p>Now, if you are a position where you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suffering</span>, where you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">questioning</span> the faithfulness of God, where you are in a situation comparable to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the exile of the Jewish people</span>, then this verse can be applied more directly to your life (though we still have to deal with the fact that you are not a member of the Jewish nation).</p>
<p><strong>But we really need to stop using it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lightly</span>.</strong> Because when Jeremiah wrote these words to the Jewish people in Babylon, he was not writing them lightly but probably with tears in his eyes. God did not speak them lightly but rather as the eternal Yahweh who will keep his word even in light of the faithlessness of his people.</p>
<p><strong>And if we are going to be the light of the world, then we need to make sure we are treating the Bible the way it deserves to be treated so that we can truly tell the world what God wants them to hear, and not just read them some verse that we don’t fully understand ourselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s be wary of treating the Bible like trail mix because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the world doesn’t need trail mix</span>, it needs to see the God of the Bible in all his power and love and hope.</strong></p>

</p>
<p>A great green theologian of old claimed that anger is based on fear, that it leads to hatred, and results in suffering. And while I do not wish to disregard the wisdom of a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I would like to take a closer look at anger as discussed in Scripture, and to consider what makes certain instances of anger righteous or unrighteous, legitimate or illegitimate.</p>
<p>This is a question that has been on my mind throughout my final year at Cedarville University. After hearing of a few rumblings at the end of my Junior year, I left for the summer and got myself married. When my feet finally touched the ground at the beginning of term, my university felt like a battlefield. I heard that Michael Pahl had been “reviewed” and then fired over the summer months. Others were being reviewed to see if they really did toe the doctrinal line, or if they were guilty of mind crimes against the thought police. And things didn’t get any better from there.</p>
<p>I saw the havoc that the Cedarville environment was wreaking on my mentors, friends, and their families. My leaders got rid of and harassed beloved members of my community, and then deceptively refused to own up to their nefarious actions.</p>
<p><a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2786885016/098d40ad39a165603e09a1915c37f88a.jpeg" alt=""  />
</a><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/">I got angry. I spoke up</a>. And I was convinced that my anger was righteous. Others were less convinced.</p>
<p>Some stayed poignantly and painfully silent throughout the chaos. Others repeatedly gave platitudes that everything was OK, that we were obligated to trust our leaders, that to question their actions was inherently disrespectful. And some from this latter group met my kind of anger with their own frustration and anger that I dared to criticize their beloved Cedarville.</p>
<p>I’d love to say that I met this opposition with nothing but grace and equanimity, but that wouldn’t be true. I frequently lashed out against these types of people – when they sent me long messages to accuse me of causing unnecessary dissentious strife, or when they parodied us student activists as complete morons with nothing better to do than cook up conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>My university’s behavior was sickening, but these people’s behavior was infuriating. I couldn’t comprehend how they could overlook the suffering I was witnessing and try to protect people who were clearly hiding the truth. So, at times, I lashed out in frustration. And I am convinced that my anger was unrighteous. But what’s the difference between these two types of anger?</p>
<p>Before considering how we should be rightly angry, I’d like to ask three questions. The first is for our great green theologian:</p>
<h1 id="yoda-does-righteous-anger-exist">YODA, DOES RIGHTEOUS ANGER EXIST?</h1>
<p>According to Yoda and friends, there is no such thing as legitimate anger, at least not humanly-speaking. After all, doesn’t Proverbs (29:11, NET) say that:</p>
<p>“A fool lets fly with all his temper,</p>
<p>but a wise person keeps it back.”?</p>
<p>And James (1:19-20) says:</p>
<p>“Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness.”</p>
<p>Or what about when Paul says (Eph 4:31-32):</p>
<p>“You must put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling, and slanderous talk—indeed all malice. Instead, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ also forgave you.”</p>
<p>When these verses are combined with our all-too-familiar ways of speaking about “gentle Jesus, meek and mild,” anger ends up getting quite the bad rap! Aren’t Christians supposed to “turn the other cheek” (Matt 5:39)? Aren’t we supposed to keep calm and stay in line – head down, Bible open, mouth shut?</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, Scripture provides a much more complex view of anger than this.</p>
<p>For example, consider Ephesians 4:26-27. Four verses before the command to “put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling … [and] all malice,” Paul tells the Ephesian believers to “Be angry and do not sin.” However, he then continues with the admonition to “not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger” and to “not give the devil an opportunity.”</p>
<p>Although Paul’s seemingly contradictory counsel here is usually used to denounce anger as an appropriate emotion, a closer analysis of these two verses in context appears to give righteous anger a legitimate place when sin infects the Christian community. That is, giving the devil a foothold could refer to either the sin which anger might produce, or to allowing the sin which caused the anger in the first place to fester, but it is not an indictment of the anger itself.</p>
<p>And this is probably for the best, because examples abound of Yahweh, his Son, and his servants getting quite angry!</p>
<p>Consider Exodus 22:22-24:</p>
<p>“You must not afflict any widow or orphan. If you afflict them in any way and they cry to me, I will surely hear their cry, and my anger will burn and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives will be widows and your children will be fatherless.</p>
<p>In the original Hebrew, this passage is even more intense, along the following lines: “If you afflict them <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in even the slightest way</span>, and they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">even think about crying out</span> to me, then I will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hearingly hear</span> their cry. My <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fiery anger will burn</span>, and I will kill you with the sword, so that, in exchange, YOUR wives will be widows and YOUR children will be orphans.” So much for gentle Yahweh, meek and mild!</p>
<p>In the New Testament, we see that the Son of God gets angry as well. After all, when he witnesses money-changers making his Father’s holy house into a marketplace, he doesn’t calmly suggest that they leave. Instead, he makes a whip, flips their tables, scatters their coins, and drives them out of the temple! (Jn 2:13-22).</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider Jesus’ anger at the hypocritical practices of both the scribes and the Pharisees (Matt 23). He calls them children of hell (23:15), blind fools (23:17), whitewashed tombs (23:27), the offspring of vipers (23:33), and descendants of those who murdered the prophets (23:31)!</p>
<p>And speaking of the prophets, as some of Yahweh’s most faithful servants in the midst of faithless generations, they got quite angry themselves! Examples abound, but one of my personal favorites is Amos 7:16-17, the prophet Amos’s response to being told by Amaziah not to preach against Jeroboam and Israel:</p>
<p>So now listen to the Lord’s message! You say, ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel! Don’t preach against the family of Isaac!’</p>
<p>“Therefore this is what the Lord says:</p>
<p>‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets</p>
<p>and your sons and daughters will die violently.</p>
<p>Your land will be given to others</p>
<p>and you will die in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Israel will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.’”</p>
<p>Based on the behavior of Yahweh, Jesus, and the prophets, it seems that we should reconsider Yoda’s position and at least acknowledge that righteous anger exists. In at least some circumstances, it is possible to be angry and please God.</p>
<p>Our second question, then, is for the most successful Hebrew prophet, who got angry for all the wrong reasons:</p>
<h1 id="jonah-are-you-really-so-very-angry">JONAH, ARE YOU REALLY SO VERY ANGRY?</h1>
<h1 id="httpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediaenthumb117jonah-_a_veggietales_moviejpg220px-jonah-_a_veggietales_moviejpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Jonah-_A_VeggieTales_Movie.jpg/220px-Jonah-_A_VeggieTales_Movie.jpg" alt=""  />
</h1>
<p>I’m presupposing that you all know the basic story of Jonah. You know, the bit about how he refuses to go to the Assyrian capital (Nineveh), gets himself cast into the sea and swallowed by a huge fish, and eventually goes to preach a one sentence prophetic message that turns out to be remarkably successful – everyone from the Ninevite king to the Ninevite cattle repented in sackcloth!</p>
<p>However, the book of Jonah is a much richer literary work than we often give it credit. As just one example out of many ingenious literary moves in the book, us readers never find out Jonah’s motivation for his disobedience, reluctance, and frustration until the fourth and final chapter. As was read earlier, Nineveh’s repentance and Yahweh’s relent from judgment…(Jonah 4:1-4)</p>
<p>displeased Jonah terribly and he became very angry. He prayed to the Lord and said, “Oh, Lord, this is just what I thought would happen when I was in my own country. This is what I tried to prevent by attempting to escape to Tarshish!—</p>
<p>What Jonah has to say next, however, is even more shocking!</p>
<p>because I knew that you are gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in mercy, and one who relents concerning threatened judgment. So now, Lord, kill me instead, because I would rather die than live!”</p>
<p>Jonah’s not angry because of injustice or even inconvenience…he’s angry because of God’s mercy or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>hesed</em></span>: his gracious, compassionate, relenting, merciful, and steadfast love! But before we consider the heinous nature of such anger, let’s note that this is a theologically astute observation on Jonah’s part. He’s quoting a creed which gets at the heart of who Yahweh is:</p>
<p>Consider Exodus 34:6</p>
<p>The Lord passed by before him and proclaimed: “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in loyal love (hesed) and faithfulness,</p>
<p>Nehemiah 9:17</p>
<p>But you are a God of forgiveness, merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and unfailing in your loyal love (hesed).</p>
<p>Psalm 86:15</p>
<p>But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God.</p>
<p>You are patient and demonstrate great loyal love (hesed) and faithfulness.</p>
<p>Joel 2:13</p>
<p>Return to the Lord your God,</p>
<p>for he is merciful and compassionate,</p>
<p>slow to anger and boundless in loyal love—often relenting from calamitous punishment.</p>
<p>Yahweh is slow to anger (literally “long of nostrils,” picture the deep sigh you give when someone frustrates you) and abounding in <em>hesed</em>, which predisposes him toward mercy, compassion, and even relenting from judgment, as he had just done with the Ninevites. And THIS is what makes Jonah so upset.</p>
<p>Instead of being joyful at the broad scope of the Gospel as God’s redemptive mission, at the remarkable success of his brief prophetic endeavor, and at the complete repentance of the Ninevite people, Jonah is furious because God has broken his mold. Yahweh had chosen to relent and to redeem the Ninevite other, and for Jonah, this was simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>Yahweh’s first rhetorical question, “Are you really so very angry?” (4:4) fails to bring Jonah around. And things get even worse. Jonah goes to sit and see what would happen to Nineveh. God sends a <em>qiqayon</em>, a little plant, to provide shade for the ornery prophet, and Jonah was very delighted. However, Yahweh the masterful teacher then sends a worm to devour the plant and a hot east wind to make Jonah faint. True to form, Jonah again cries out in anger: “I would rather die than live!” (4:8).</p>
<p>Yahweh challenges Jonah again: “Are you really (or rightly) so very angry about the little plant?” Jonah replies: “I have good reason to be angry, even to death (NASB or) I am as angry as I could possibly be!” (4:9).</p>
<p>Then Yahweh brings the lesson home with force: “You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight. 11 Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city (implied: for which I worked and which I caused to grow!) in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals? (4:10-11, NASB)”</p>
<p>Jonah’s anger was unrighteous in that it was a self-centered hindrance to God’s mission. By scorning Yahweh’s mercy and ignoring the broad scope of his redemptive <em>hesed</em> love, Jonah disdained the repentance of the Ninevite other. He got angry for all the wrong reasons. And yet his failures are a powerful indictment against our own. After all, at least 90% of my anger is driven by selfish concerns. It’s not even an “us vs. them” moment most of the time. It’s usually ME vs. everyone else! and I can’t often care any LESS about God’s redemptive mission, as long as the checkout line’s moving too slowly for my liking, as long as the car in front of me just cut me off, as long as there’s someone on the internet with whom I disagree!</p>
<p>If it’s so easy to fall into Jonah-like frustration, is there any hope left for righteous anger?</p>
<p>Let’s ask the prophet who got to preach Jonah’s dream message against Nineveh:</p>
<h1 id="nahum-why-is-god-so-angryfilenahum-prophetjpghttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommons774nahum-prophetjpg">NAHUM, WHY IS GOD SO ANGRY?<img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Nahum-prophet.jpg" alt="File:Nahum-prophet.jpg"  />
</h1>
<p>In the seventh century BC, Nahum got to preach the prophetic oracles against Nineveh that Jonah had wanted to utter. Apparently, although Nineveh and the Assyrians had been used by God as an instrument of judgment in the eighth century exile, they had grown prideful of their vicious pursuits. Drunk with the blood of their victims, the Assyrians paid no mind to Yahweh who had allowed them to thrive. This brought about a change in the divine approach to the Assyrian empire. We can see this in Nahum’s modification of the traditional credal statement mentioned above. Let’s take another look at Nahum 1:2-3:</p>
<p>The Lord is a zealous and avenging God;</p>
<p>the Lord is avenging and very angry.</p>
<p>The Lord takes vengeance against his foes;</p>
<p>he sustains his rage against his enemies.</p>
<p>3 The Lord is slow to anger but great in power;</p>
<p>the Lord will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.</p>
<p>If you’ll compare Nahum 1:3 with Jonah 4:2, you’ll see what I mean. Although the traditional form is “Yahweh is slow to anger, but great in <em>hesed</em>,” Nahum switches <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>hesed</em></span> out with <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>power</em></span>. No longer would the vicious Assyrians experience the merciful and steadfast love of Yahweh. As <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Nahum+1:3">one commentator puts it</a>, “God’s patience at the time of Jonah one century earlier had run out. Nineveh had exhausted the “great mercy” of God and now would experience the “great power” of God.” The rest of the book of Nahum is a series of oracles describing exactly what this would mean.</p>
<p>I believe that Nahum’s devastating oracles against Nineveh were important to the Hebrew mindset because they preserved Yahweh’s powerful justice as the counterpoint to the themes of merciful universalism in books like Jonah. Nahum’s relationship to Jonah is a bit like the relationship of Job and Ecclesiastes to Proverbs. The former provide important theological counterpoints to the latter books. In Jonah, Yahweh desires to teach the arrogant Hebrew prophet a lesson about the scope of the divine mission of mercy and redemption. Although it’s understandable why Jonah would have been hesitant to see Nineveh repent and be delivered from judgment (given Assyria’s messy relationship with Israel), Yahweh wanted to show Jonah that NO ONE was outside of his mercy’s reach. In fact, sometimes Ninevites repent better than God’s chosen people!</p>
<p>But what about when the Ninevites are consistently guilty of atrocities against God’s people? Sure, that doesn’t mean Israel should go all Jonah on them and discount the possibility of repentance/deliverance ever occurring, but what about on God’s end of the deal? Is he so merciful that he no longer cares about injustice? Is he getting soft? Turning into some passive nice guy who’s only mildly bothered by things like slaughter and oppression?</p>
<p>Books like Nahum answer those kind of painful questions cried out by victims of oppression:</p>
<p>No. Yahweh is not complacent when it comes to heinous sin. In fact, he hates it more than any human possibly could. This does not negate his mercy – the message of Jonah still stands – but he is not a passive onlooker when it comes to Sin and Death and those who enact them. He is a mighty warrior on a mission of redemption and deliverance, especially when it comes to the powerless and the oppressed. This theme echoes throughout the pages of Scripture, from the Exodus to the Cross to the coming Kingdom. The righteous anger of Yahweh is redemptive, and it usually focuses on the mistreatment of the weak.</p>
<h1 id="how-then-should-we-be-angry">HOW, THEN, SHOULD WE BE ANGRY?</h1>
<p>If Yoda, Jonah, and Nahum have taught us anything, we should acknowledge that the crucial difference between righteous and unrighteous anger is whether it helps or hinders God’s redemptive mission, the Gospel. It’s important, then, that we sit long with Scripture and the Church in order to better know what the Gospel really is. The more clearly we understand the foundational Gospel principles of things like <em>shalom</em> peace, <em>hesed</em> love, and <em>mishpat</em> justice, the more likely it is that we’ll recognize the appropriate things to get angry about. As we become more familiar with God’s redemptive mission, we should gently remind Yoda and others that there is indeed a place for anger which is pleasing to God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should heed the warnings of Jonah’s failures, lest our anger be just as self-centered and Gospel-opposed as his was. After all, we can ALWAYS stumble down Jonah’s path. When it comes to my anger against my alma mater and my online detractors, as much as I’d like to paint the unjust fundamentalists as the Jonahs of the story… I’m just as much like Jonah when I refuse to believe that God can work through them, when I place them outside of the scope of God’s redemptive mission. We do well to consider continually whether our anger is stubbornly self-centered, and to remind ourselves that Yahweh is (insert deep, calming sigh) slow to anger and abounding in hesed. The people of God should strive to exemplify the same attributes.</p>
<p>However, Nahum reminds us that God will not be mocked. He takes oppressive opposition to his redemptive mission very seriously, and the divine warrior’s wrath is kindled when Sin and Death rear their ugly heads in this world. He rages against the violence, poverty, famine, hunger, disease, disasters, and indifference which kill untold millions of his precious image-bearers each year. His fiery anger burns when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-selective_abortion">baby girls are killed for nothing more than their gender</a>, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Savar_building_collapse">people die amid the rubble of poorly-built factories for the sake of corporate greed</a> – the idols of wealth and power, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS">children have to witness their parents die from HIV/AIDS</a>, not knowing how long they and their siblings have before the disease takes their lives as well. If these things do not anger us, something is wrong.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most infuriating thing to Yahweh is when those who have been redeemed in and through his precious Son commit injustices in his holy name! I can only imagine how angry it makes God that his people treat others as inferior beings – be it <a href="http://dannimoss.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/paige-patterson-on-domestic-violence/">women</a>, or <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2006/winter/christian-nativism#.UZgp2LWG3ng">immigrants</a>, or <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">homosexuals</a>, or <a href="http://www.biblerays.com/race-mixing.html">other races</a>, or the poor – for the sake of a pretentious and profane pride they DARE to call holiness.</p>
<p>Or what about the divine heartbreak over the fragmentation of the Church? Can you imagine how much it upsets God when his people split for every little reason, in pursuit of supposed “purity,” ignoring that the goal of his redemptive mission is to reconcile all things to himself, to make us ONE in Christ?</p>
<p>To bring this closer to home, can you imagine how much it upsets God that <a href="http://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">my university</a>, which claims to exist “For the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ,” has repeatedly shown itself willing to mistreat godly people and then to lie about it? That the leaders of Cedarville are willing to buy the silence of the mistreated through non-disclosure agreements? That they are willing to appeal to God’s knowledge by using platitudes like “God is not surprised” to justify their actions against those who have less power? What happened to Michael Pahl and his family, <a href="http://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">in addition to many others this year within the Cedarville community</a> at the hands of those who claim Christ’s name has been appallingly shameful.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters, we serve a God who is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast, merciful, and compassionate love. Let us not forget these things. May we, as God’s people, always be driven by the logic of his redemptive love.</p>
<p>But Yahweh is also immensely powerful and passionate, and often very angry about the effects of Sin and Death around the world and among his people. Therefore, let us not sin in our anger, as we are prone to do, but let us oppose sin in our righteous anger, with our eyes and our hearts turned toward the powerless, oppressed, sick, broken, and dying of this world as we further Yahweh’s redemptive mission and accomplish the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>(Originally posted in <a href="http://www.theventriloquist.us/">The Ventriloquist</a>. Go check out the rest of <a href="http://www.theventriloquist.us/">Issue 10</a>!)</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“A Farewell to Cedarville” – Joshua Steele</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>As what was once a vision for the future has become an agenda for returning to the past, the list of people who no longer fit the Cedarville mold is growing.</strong> I contacted former vice president of Student Life, Dr. <a href="http://www.carlruby.com/">Carl Ruby</a>; former professor Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelpahl/">Michael Pahl</a>; current professors Dr. TC Ham, Dr. Shawn Graves, and Dr. David Mills; and former trustees Dr. William Rudd and Rev. Chris Williamson to see where things stand as this academic year comes to a close.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Ruby does not know what the long term future holds, he is pouring himself into immigration reform. When asked about his plans, he replied: “I’m motivated by an experience that I had on the Civil Rights bus tour in Birmingham, Alabama. As I read King’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail, I determined that I didn’t want to be on the wrong side of history, or more important, on the wrong side of the gospel on these kinds of issues. I leave Cedarville with lots of good memories and a clear conscience. I hope I invested my time and energy in the things that mattered most … loving God and loving people.”</p>
<p>And speaking of immigrants, Dr. Pahl moved his family nearly 2,000 miles as the crow flies from Alberta, Canada to Cedarville, Ohio in 2011. However, after just two semesters, the “promising scholar” and “dedicated teacher” was fired for his inability <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/documents-2/the-dismissal-of-dr-pahl/">“to concur fully with each and every position of Cedarville University’s doctrinal statement.”</a> The Pahls have spent the year trying to move on – looking for work, and working on renovations to sell the old parsonage which they bought less than three months before receiving notice of Dr. Pahl’s “review.”</p>
<p>It would be one thing if the Pahls were victims of a broken immigration system. It seems, however, that they are victims of a broken institution which claims the name of Christ.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Ruby and Dr. Pahl had little say regarding their terminations, others are voluntarily choosing to disassociate from the University.</p>
<p>Prompted by the changing Cedarville climate, Dr. Ham will be making the move to Canton, OH this summer to teach at <a href="http://www.malone.edu/">Malone University</a>. “I should note that I am not being forced to resign. I am leaving voluntarily,” Dr. Ham clarified. “However, I would not have been seeking other ministry opportunities had the past two years been different. For me, it was the events surrounding the termination of my good friend Michael Pahl that prompted me to look elsewhere. Other recent events—mostly known to the student body, but some unknown to them—have served to solidify my decision. While I am very excited about my future ministry, it is with profound sadness that I leave the wonderful men and women I’ve known as colleagues here.”</p>
<p>After the elimination of the philosophy major, Dr. Graves was offered a terminal contract. However, he has instead accepted a tenure track position at the <a href="http://www.findlay.edu/Pages/default.aspx">University of Findlay</a>, where he will begin teaching this fall. His wife, <a href="http://marlenagraves.com/">Marlena Graves</a>, will conclude her role as the Resident Director of Murphy Hall at the end of this semester.</p>
<p>Dr. Mills, if he is at Cedarville next year, will have to carry the course load for the remaining philosophy minor in Dr. Graves’ absence. Dr. Mills declined the option to drastically expand the Honors Program during the 2013-14 school year before handing it over to an unknown successor, and was therefore removed from his involvement in the program, effective at the end of this semester.</p>
<p>The voluntary disassociations are not limited to faculty and staff, but also include trustees. Recent changes in the Board have included the resignations of <a href="http://calvarymuskegon.com/#/about-calvary/our-ministry-team">Dr. Rudd</a> and <a href="http://www.strongtowerbiblechurch.com/#/our-team">Rev. Williamson</a>, two proponents of the same concerns held by student advocates such as myself.</p>
<p>Dr. Rudd, who served as a Cedarville trustee for over 20 years, including multiple terms as Board Chairman, had the following to say regarding his resignation:</p>
<p>“I’m very thankful for CU and the privilege of being very closely associated with it for so many years. I have many dear friends there who are amazing servants of God. It saddens me deeply that I could no longer support actions and direction of the current leadership and that I was no longer able to exert influence for what I believe to be truthfulness, integrity, and Biblical consistency. God has graciously blessed Cedarville and there are many, many wonderful people still associated with it. I pray that the leadership will be restored to Biblical integrity.”</p>
<p>In Rev. Williamson’s words: “The board of trustees repeatedly mishandled God’s servants while virtually ignoring the cries of students and alumni alike. Any hint of due process was abandoned, and the ability to have respectful dialogues on key issues was non-existent. I resigned because I could no longer be associated with a group that was constantly untruthful and unjust.”</p>
<p><strong>And so the Cedarville diaspora grows</strong>. If this university is going to inspire true greatness, it should avoid driving away godly individuals like Ruby, Pahl, Ham, Graves, Mills, Williamson, and Rudd in the future.</p>
<p>Some may accuse me of biting the hand that feeds. But it is not the same hand.</p>
<p>I have been fed by Carl Ruby’s Cedarville, not the new Cedarville of twenty years ago. As the University hearkens back to the glory days before creeping “liberalism” reached the bubble’s border, the leadership has responded to repeated requests for clarity and honesty with poignant silences and disappointing distortions of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>God is not surprised. I wonder if he is angered, though, by having his knowledge and sovereignty used to justify injustice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cedarville, fulfill your call and be true to our God – not by claiming institutional prerogatives to drive away our Christlike best – but by doing justice, promoting honesty, and walking humbly with Him whose name we claim.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Update</em>:</strong></span> <em>Dr. Carl B. Smith, Professor of Church History, has willfully decided to turn in an unsigned contract. Although he does not have further employment lined up at this time, he will not be returning to Cedarville for the 2013-14 academic year.</em></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yahweh and others have been too good to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I received two awards at Cedarville University’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/cf/calendar/viewsingleevent/id/b30deaf6-2481-ade4-b080-a503cd1527b2&#34;&gt;49th Annual Academic Honors Day Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first: The Oxford University Press Award in Preseminary Bible, given to the graduating senior with the highest cumulative GPA in the preseminary major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/financialaid/Daniel+Award&#34;&gt;The Daniel Award.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Established in 2001 by David and Jean Heyd, this endowed award was created to honor their parents, Charles and E. LaRue Wilcox and Elmer and Kathy Heyd. The scholarship assists a graduating full-time male senior student who has been accepted by a conservative evangelical seminary. The recipient must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3, demonstrate the spiritual qualifications and godly leadership skills necessary to excel in this ministry, and plan to serve as full-time pastor of a church. […] The Department of Biblical and Ministry Studies faculty select the recipients.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

</p>
<p>The first award got me a copy of <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Bibles/ParallelTextBibles/NewInternationalVersion/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5NTI4MTM2MQ==">The Contemporary Parallel New Testament</a> (edited by Kohlenberger, III). The second award? $5,000 toward my seminary education. Barring any significant price hikes, that should cover the remainder of my tuition at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a> for the next 3.5 years!</p>
<p>Despite my standing critiques of Cedarville University, I must admit that my life would look radically different today had I not arrived here four years ago.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dscn0863.jpg?w=650" alt="Image"  />
</p>
<p>As I look forward to the next stage of my life, I’m realizing more and more how much my life each day depends on the grace and generosity of others. I’m extremely thankful for the opportunities – even the painful ones – I’ve been given to live, learn, and grow at Cedarville. I never would have imagined meeting so many <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelpahl/">wonderful</a>, <a href="http://www.carlruby.com/">Christlike</a>, and challenging people in the middle of cornfields in Southwest Ohio.</p>
<p>I’m thankful that God’s Kingdom transcends Cedarville,<br>
but also that I’ve gotten to glimpse the Kingdom here.</p>
<p>Grace and Peace,</p>
<p>~Josh</p>

      <title>On Building/Burning Bridges</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: there’s a fair bit about the Church that frustrates me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’d like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I’d like first to aim them at myself. After all, if I want to witness self-righteous pride, xenophobia, misplaced anger, etc., I need look no further than the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DISCLAIMER: there’s a fair bit about the Church that frustrates me.</p>
<p>However, I’d like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.</p>
<p>Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I’d like first to aim them at myself. After all, if I want to witness self-righteous pride, xenophobia, misplaced anger, etc., I need look no further than the mirror.</p>
<p>However, building bridges (much less walking across them and back unscathed) can be quite difficult in our post-/hyper-modern day. Each post I pass along (usually via Facebook and Twitter, but also here on the blog), thinking it interesting/challenging/inspiring, can generate everything from cheers to tears, it can bring life and also offend. This isn’t a bad thing. In fact, I’d argue that it’s good and necessary to be both inspired and angered by certain things.</p>
<p>…but it can make things quite complicated and messy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’m more worried about returning from the other side of the bridge *unchanged* than unscathed. But if I’m going to be successful, I need your help.</p>
<p>For one thing, I need your charity. No, not monetary charity (at least not now!), but for you, all of you, to be charitable readers. I don’t have enough time to explain fully my thoughts on and interpretation of every link/article that I post. Frequently, I do agree in some way with the author(s) of those links, but I would almost never be willing to sign off on each and every thing they say. Look for the good and true in each posted thing, and join me in thinking through what these authors have to say. That’s usually the goal of most of my postings: to get people to think.</p>
<p>Second, if something I’ve posted or said has caused a deep rift between you and me – a rift which probably goes deeper than a superficial misunderstanding – feel free to contact me and we can try to clear things up. I can’t guarantee that we’ll see eye-to-eye on things, and we might even have a sharper disagreement as a result, but I’d like to always value people more than I value positions, relationships more than reasons.</p>
<p>Both sides in most debates have at least one thing to learn from their opponents. Give me a chance to learn from you – if not to change my opinions, at least so that I can sincerely hold my own differing opinions.</p>
<p>After all, disagreeing with a bunch of straw men is no good at all. Meaningful arguments have faces.</p>

      <title>Let There Be Light: My Resignation</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/let-there-be-light-my-resignation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2013 16:45:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/let-there-be-light-my-resignation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Please read:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/leadership-transfer-2/&#34;&gt;Let There Be Light – Leadership Transfer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until further notice, I hereby rescind my use of the Let There Be Light platform&lt;/strong&gt; (including &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/fiatlux125&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fiatlux125&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;to protest recent changes at Cedarville University.&lt;/strong&gt; The LTBL platform will now be &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;exclusively alumni-run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and I encourage everyone interested in developments at the University to follow their posts and make subsequent judgments regarding Cedarville’s identity and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal in all of this is &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to honor my Messiah by following him well and furthering his Kingdom with justice, unity, and true peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>**Please read:</strong></em> </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong><a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/leadership-transfer-2/">Let There Be Light – Leadership Transfer</a></strong></em></span><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>**</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Until further notice, I hereby rescind my use of the Let There Be Light platform</strong> (including <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fiatlux125">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fiatlux125">Twitter</a>) <strong>to protest recent changes at Cedarville University.</strong> The LTBL platform will now be <em><strong>exclusively alumni-run</strong></em>, and I encourage everyone interested in developments at the University to follow their posts and make subsequent judgments regarding Cedarville’s identity and vision.</p>
<p>My goal in all of this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>to honor my Messiah by following him well and furthering his Kingdom with justice, unity, and true peace.</strong></span></p>
<p>Let it be known that <strong>I am bitterly disappointed with the direction in which Cedarville University is currently heading.</strong> Unless its leaders frankly and forthrightly admit their agenda for the future and their recent decisions including the firing of Dr. Carl Ruby, I cannot in good conscience recommend Cedarville to any prospective students. If CU leaders are willing to get rid of people like Dr. Ruby and yet unwilling to admit that they’ve done so, that’s not just <span style="text-decoration:underline;">disingenuous</span> – it’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;">dangerous</span>.</p>
<p>I also cannot recommend a place which holds un-scholarly documents as <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">the White Papers</a> as official explanations of its doctrinal stances. I cannot recommend a place where people like Dr. Michael Pahl are not allowed to teach, and where good evangelicals are “reviewed” by ad hoc doctrinal panels. I cannot recommend a place where my mentors are harassed for being forthright with their students. If <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/poignant-revealing-words/">Bob Gresh’s words are true and men like Mr. Scharnberg want to return Cedarville University to the “real Cedarville” of 19 years ago</a>, I cannot support such a move. That’s not the Cedarville I’ve known and loved.</p>
<p><strong>My resignation from <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">Let There Be Light</a> does not change these personal opinions</strong>. However, I do pray that Cedarville might change and thrive, so that one day I can gladly and sincerely recommend it once more.</p>
<p>I will continue to use my own personal social media outlets to express my views freely and openly. For now, as a current student of Cedarville University, I will content myself with asking questions, trying to make sense of all this, and encouraging the members of the CU community who have had the biggest impact on my life.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">With people like Carl Ruby, Chris Williamson, and Bill Rudd gone, we’re quickly losing leaders at Cedarville who will advocate for these types of concerns.</span></strong> I’m therefore convinced that my time left at Cedarville will be better spent on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">encouragement</span> than <span style="text-decoration:underline;">advocacy</span>. Although I am unsatisfied with the recent decisions and direction of my University, there are still many good and godly women and men here whom I’d like to uplift and affirm before I graduate.</p>
<p>Although I will no longer be a contributing member of Let There Be Light, I ask you to join with me in always calling for transparency and justice within our respective communities. The justice-filled Kingdom of God is being built one context, one community at a time, all over the world.</p>
<p>I do not regret founding <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">Let There Be Light</a>, nor do I regret my efforts to make Cedarville a more just community by striking a prophetic pose as a student with relatively little to lose. I’ve not done it perfectly (see my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/02/22/open-apology/" title="Open Apology">Open Apology</a>), but speaking truth to power will always be necessary.</p>
<p>Our God is a god of justice, peace, and unity. There can be no true unity or peace without justice.</p>
<p><em><strong>He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>And what does the Lord require of you?</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>To act justly and to love mercy</strong></em><br>
<em><strong>and to walk humbly with your God.</strong></em></p>
<p>Grace and Peace,</p>
<p>Joshua Steele</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To whomever the following concerns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d like to apologize publicly to any persons I may have offended during the past few months of my student activism efforts at Cedarville University.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, I recognize that some of my statements/claims about the perceived injustices at my University have seemed quite shocking, especially without further context. So I apologize for the times when I put pithiness before precision and unwittingly ostracized many good people whom I was not intending to criticize at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To whomever the following concerns:</p>
<p><strong>I’d like to apologize publicly to any persons I may have offended during the past few months of my student activism efforts at Cedarville University.</strong></p>
<p>After all, I recognize that some of my statements/claims about the perceived injustices at my University have seemed quite shocking, especially without further context. So I apologize for the times when I put pithiness before precision and unwittingly ostracized many good people whom I was not intending to criticize at all.</p>
<p>Many times my frustration – directed at the nebulous group of trustees and administrators most directly responsible for things like the White Papers, the firing of Michael Pahl, and the firing of Carl Ruby – has seeped over and negatively affected some of the good people I’d like to defend and advocate for, if it were their necks on the chopping block.</p>
<p>There are MANY great people at Cedarville University in between those who’ve been fired and those who’ve made the firing decisions, and I don’t want to overlook them or accidentally attack them. If you’re a member of that group and you’ve been put-off by my recent words and actions, I truly am sorry. Please forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>I’d also like to apologize publicly for any embarrassment I’ve caused to the Kingdom of God in this process.</strong></p>
<p>That is, while I’m NOT sorry for seeking prophetically to address injustices being committed by the people of God against the people of God, I AM sorry if I’ve given the impression to those on the outside looking in that this is how Christianity always goes.</p>
<p>(This is not a retraction of my activism efforts, for I am sincerely convinced that the University has committed institutional sins, if you will, in its recent decisions.)</p>
<p>However, I would like to remind all “outsiders” that following Jesus of Nazareth is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>not</strong> </span>supposed to look like the current controversies which plague Cedarville University. Christianity is more than just intrigue and infighting, although those things will always be a part of Christendom until the end of days because us Christians are messed-up people just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Would you <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>please forgive me, and please forgive us Christians, for doing a poor job of representing Yahweh to you?</strong> </span></p>
<p>He is a God of unity, justice, and peace, and yet far too often we, as his people, miserably fail at embodying those things.</p>
<p>In the end, Yahweh has told us human beings what is good: to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. (Micah 6:8.)</p>
<p>Justice, mercy, and humility.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for when I’ve failed to embody <span style="text-decoration:underline;">mercy</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">humility</span> in my pursuit of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">justice</span>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Joshua Steele</p>

&lt;p&gt;How dare you try and accomplish this (already concerning) return to fundamentalism in an unethical manner! How dare you sacrifice good men and their families on the altar of your own agenda, and then proceed to bathe your actions in lies!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been extremely frustrated with someone/thing you love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s been my experience during my final year here at Cedarville University. See, &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/&#34;&gt;I love this place.&lt;/a&gt; And that’s why I can’t stand it sometimes. There are still so many good and godly women and men here, so much potential for God’s Kingdom. And that’s why recent decisions made by Cedarville Admins and Trustees are so heartbreaking. &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/&#34; title=&#34;Open Letter to Cedarville Admins and Trustees&#34;&gt;I’ve written about this before&lt;/a&gt; (Open Letter).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been extremely frustrated with someone/thing you love?</p>
<p>That’s been my experience during my final year here at Cedarville University. See, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/">I love this place.</a> And that’s why I can’t stand it sometimes. There are still so many good and godly women and men here, so much potential for God’s Kingdom. And that’s why recent decisions made by Cedarville Admins and Trustees are so heartbreaking. <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/01/13/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/" title="Open Letter to Cedarville Admins and Trustees">I’ve written about this before</a> (Open Letter).</p>
<p>The sources of my angst? I’ll give you the top three from my growing list of concerns.</p>
<h2 id="the-white-papershttpwwwcallcentrehelpercomimagesstories2010white_papersgif">The White Papers<img loading="lazy" src="http://www.callcentrehelper.com/images/stories/2010/white_papers.gif" alt=""  />
</h2>
<p>I found out about these a year ago, when I had no idea of the storm that was brewing. I won’t spend time repeating what’s already been well said about the Papers <a href="http://theventriloquist.us/article/whats_wrong_with_white_papers">here </a>and <a href="http://www.mulberrycommunity.com/2012/10/is-that-so-cedarville.html">here</a>, but suffice it to say that if I turned in a White Paper as an undergraduate theological essay, I’d be getting a C- and a talk from my professor for my sub-par work. It’s patently obvious that Bib/Theo scholars were NOT consulted in the composition of these documents. Or, if they were, they were summarily ignored. And CU is making PhDs in Bib/Theo studies sign these things! Despicable.</p>
<p>This seems like a shameful attempt of reigning in the “creeping liberalism” of Cedarville’s Bible department. First, if you know any of the conservative evangelical CU Bible faculty, you’ll realize that this is some sort of sick joke. Second, at least proofread your documents to the standards of good scholarship! Even if I agreed with the White Papers’ attempts to silence debate and discussion on matters related to creation, justification, and omniscience, I would still be ashamed of their poor quality.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read Cedarville’s White Papers, they can <em>finally</em> be found <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">here</a> (to the right), on the University website. We had to petition and then wait <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>a couple months</strong></span> before the Administration publicly posted the White Papers, even though they are supposed to describe the University’s <em><strong>official position</strong></em> on three important areas of doctrine!!! Did Cedarville ever intend on releasing these documents if students hadn’t petitioned Dr. Gredy and Dr. Cornman? Or were the White Papers just supposed to be a secret weapon to cleanse the Bible faculty? Apparently they were important enough to be used in the firing of Dr. Michael Pahl.</p>
<h2 id="michael-pahlhttpwwwcedarvilleedumediaimagescampus-newsnews2011michael-pahljpg">Michael Pahl<img loading="lazy" src="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Images/Campus-News/News/2011/Michael-Pahl.jpg" alt=""  />
</h2>
<p>Dr. Pahl was hired before the 2011-12 school year. He moved his family (wife and four children) all the way from Canada to Cedarville, OH, persuaded that he was going to be a good fit for the Bible department at Cedarville University. After all, the CU hiring process is lengthy and it’s a very long way to move one’s family. After teaching for just two semesters, and closing on a 100 year-old farmhouse in town, he was fired for a doctrinal discrepancy related to his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-End-Rereading-Genesiss-Revelations/dp/1608999270">The Beginning and The End</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the book was already in manuscript form when he was hired by CU, meaning that he wrote this book before he even knew he’d be working at a place that would have loved to see a shout out to Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis somewhere, anywhere in the tome’s 106 pages. Furthermore, the hiring committee was made aware of Dr. Pahl’s forthcoming book, and he taught his sample lecture during the hiring process on Genesis and the creation accounts! But that wasn’t enough to save him from getting “reviewed” by an <em>ad hoc</em> panel and “released from his teaching duties.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, he’s remained on the school’s payroll this academic year, so that he and his family didn’t get sent back to Canada right away without work or housing. However, to the best of my knowledge, he is still looking for work.</p>
<p>“Dr. Pahl’s orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility. He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students. Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.”</p>
<p>What a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">shameful way to treat a gracious and godly immigrant family.</span></p>
<h2 id="carl-rubyhttpwwwcedarvilleedumediaimagescampus-newsnews2012carl-ruby-13_001jpgw250">Carl Ruby<img loading="lazy" src="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Images/Campus-News/News/2012/Carl-Ruby-13_001.jpg?w=250" alt=""  />
</h2>
<p>As if the previous two concerns weren’t enough, the University quickly got rid of Carl Ruby, the Vice President for Student Life, this January. Not only have the Administration and Trustees neglected to justify this decision, they refuse to admit that they made the decision in the first place!!! According to the University PR statements, we’re to believe that Carl Ruby, after 25 years of service to his alma mater, randomly decided in January that now would be a great time to seek employment opportunities elsewhere. Apparently he also thought it would be great to leave his office just five days after his resignation was announced for him!</p>
<p>What’s the other option? Moral or legal failure, right? Well, Dr. Gredy (acting CU President) himself denied this at the <a href="http://cedars.cedarville.edu/article/585/SGA-Town-Hall-Meeting-Jan-22/">SGA Town Hall meeting last month</a>, saying that Ruby’s resignation was not due to a personal/moral failure.</p>
<p>What’s left, then? Well, despite my University’s urging to “not connect the dots” on these matters, the unavoidable conclusion is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em><strong>Dr. Ruby was FIRED</strong></em> </span>and that CU Admins/Trustees are hesitant (and deceptively so) to admit that.</p>
<p>Compare this “official” answer from the <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Alumni/FAQ.aspx">Cedarville Alumni and Family Questions and Answers</a> page:</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Why did Dr. Carl Ruby leave? </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Dr. John Gredy, Provost, <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Ruby-Legacy-Built-at-Cedarville-University.aspx"><span style="color:#000000;">announced to the University family</span></a> on January 10 that he and Dr. Ruby had come to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a mutual understanding</span> and that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dr. Ruby would conclude his service to Cedarville University</span>. His last day in the office was shortly thereafter, although Dr. Ruby’s administrative contract continues through June 30. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The University is committed to protecting the privacy of its employees so is not commenting publicly on the reasons for the decision</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Sadly, much speculation and questions have arisen. The Board of Trustees at its January 25 meeting carefully reviewed the events surrounding the announcement that Dr. Carl Ruby would conclude his service. The Board acknowledged and expressed regret that the lack of clarity had made this transition even more difficult for the Cedarville University family. Nonetheless, the Board of Trustees supported <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the understanding between Dr. Ruby and the administration</span>. The Board of Trustees expressed its gratitude to Dr. Ruby for his service.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“Dr. Ruby built a legacy at Cedarville, and he will be missed by many. The passions Dr. Ruby embraced were not simply his personal interests, but rather reflect core values of the Cedarville family. The University is committed to continuing these priorities.”</span></p>
<div>with this excerpt from the [Dayton Daily News’ most recent piece on Cedarville](http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/cedarville-students-alumni-question-universitys-di/nWQgS/):
<p>“Tennessee Pastor Chris Williamson said he resigned from the school’s board of trustees after being “blindsided” by what he called <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">the administration’s “mistreatment” of the vice president for student life, Carl Ruby</span></strong>, a popular 25-year veteran of Cedarville who resigned last month. […]</p>
<p>“And then, on Jan. 10, it was announced Ruby would “step down” effective June 30. But his last day on campus was Jan. 15, and hundreds of students showed their support by wearing red and lining his walk from his office to his car. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Ruby’s departure was publicly called a resignation. But Williamson said he learned at a January trustees’ meeting, “it was a termination of employment.”</strong></span></p>
<p>and with this excerpt from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/us/a-christian-college-struggles-to-define-itself.html?_r=0">New York Times piece on the Cedarville controversy</a>:</p>
<p>“The Rev. Chris Williamson of Franklin, Tenn., who last month resigned from the Cedarville board of trustees, said that <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>both the president and Dr. Ruby were considered problematic by the faction of trustees fearful of what they perceive as a creeping liberalism. “They were threatened by Carl’s approach not to theology but to ministry,”</strong></span> Mr. Williamson said, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“in terms of his ministry to people struggling with gender identification, how he ministers to people on the margins.”</strong></span></p>
<p>It would be frustrating enough if it were a secular organization committing these injustices. But to watch an organization which claims the name of Christ behave in such despicable ways? It’s intolerable.</p>
<p><strong>I’m not the only one who’s frustrated by these things: consider Scot <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2013/02/16/cedarville-the-next-episode/">McKnight</a>, Anthony <a href="http://historicaljesusresearch.blogspot.com/2012/10/concerning-controversy-related-to.html">LeDonne</a>, <a href="http://historicaljesusresearch.blogspot.com/2013/02/cedarville-university-controversy.html">LeDonne again</a>, Michael <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2012/10/michael-pahl-dismissal-from-cedarville-university/">Bird</a>, Mark <a href="http://ntweblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/michael-pahl-and-disgrace-of-cedarville.html">Goodacre</a>, and James <a href="http://jamesmcgahey.blogspot.com/2012/11/reflections-on-firing-of-michael-pahl.html">McGahey</a>.</strong></p>
<p>No, <strong>this does not mean that everyone at Cedarville is dishonest, evil or misguided</strong>. In fact, there are plenty of godly women and men here. Women and men whom I’d like to defend, because I’ve seen how stressful and fearful this environment has become for them and their families.</p>
<p>But <strong>it’s the leadership here I’m worried about</strong>. And as often as the Bible urges respect for leaders, it holds the leaders of the God’s people accountable even more so, often with strong language. Don’t believe me? Go and read the prophets, focusing on their words for the priests and princes of Israel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Images/Campus-News/News/2011/chris-williamson-fall-bible-conference.jpg" alt=""  />
As Chris Williamson put it on his Twitter account:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“There’s nothing more dangerous to the cause of Christ than religious people with an ungodly agenda. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cedarville&amp;src=hash"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><s>#</s>cedarville</span></a>”</strong></span></span></p>
<p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/gdk_chris">@gdk_chris</a>; 12:49 PM – 1 Feb 13).</p>
<p>I couldn’t agree more. And that is why <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>I’m calling the leadership of my University to repent, or to quit claiming to be Christ-centered in these matters.</strong></span></p>
<p>God will not be mocked.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>As the climactic renewal and enumeration of Yahweh’s covenant with Israel, Deuteronomy contains at its core a cross between an ancient Near Eastern law code and treaty.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Within this structure, the laws and treaty stipulations – general (5:1-11:32) and specific (12:1-26:19) – are given pride of place. After the setting and introduction to the covenant (4:44-49), Moses<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> begins his second sermon (5:1-28:69) with an interpretive restatement of the Decalogue (5:6-21), couched within an extended reflection on the initial law-giving at Horeb and Moses’ role as mediator (5:1-33).</p>
<p>In the passage at hand (6:1-15), he then transitions to the remainder of the general stipulations (6:1-11:32) with an introductory exhortation (6:1-3), a distillation of the covenant principles (6:4-5), and an extension of these principles to future generations and society (6:6-9), concluding with a warning against forgetfulness and idolatry as the Israelites soon enter the land of Canaan (6:10-15). <em><strong>In remembrance of and in response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, Israel must love Yahweh absolutely and exclusively by internalizing, embodying, and teaching covenant faithfulness as they inherit the blessings of the promised land.</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="introductory-exhortation-61-3">INTRODUCTORY EXHORTATION: 6:1-3</h1>
<p>Moses begins this passage with an exhortation to keep the general stipulations of the covenant to be discussed in Deuteronomy 6-11. In response to Yahweh’s command (recounted at 5:31), Moses teaches the people the “commandments, statutes, and ordinances” (5:31, 6:1; referring to the covenant stipulations)<sup> <a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></sup> so that they will “carry them out in the land” (5:31, 6:1).</p>
<p>This transmission of the covenant stipulations from Yahweh to Moses to the Israelites was not meant to achieve a merely epistemic result, but also an ontic one. That is, Moses was not merely teaching them the stipulations so that they would merely know (and do) the right things, but so that they would be the right kind of people, internalizing and embodying the stipulations as they entered the promised land of Canaan. The intended result of the commandments, statutes, and ordinances was holistic covenant faithfulness.</p>
<p>At the heart of the appropriate epistemic and ontic response to the covenant stipulations was the proper fear of Yahweh their God (6:2a), which was to result in a continual obedience for generations upon generations (6:2b),<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> reflecting the importance of teaching covenant faithfulness to their children.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> As the injunctions to “pay attention” and “be careful” (6:3a) indicate, this obedience was also to be careful and deliberate.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> The promised results of such continual and careful covenant faithfulness are long life (6:2c) and many descendants (6:2b, 3a) in the bountiful promised land (6:1b, 3b), recalling Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to fulfill his promises of land and offspring to Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<h1 id="distillation-of-the-covenant-principles-64-5">DISTILLATION OF THE COVENANT PRINCIPLES: 6:4-5</h1>
<p>Following the brief introduction to the general stipulations (6:1-3), Moses distills the Decalogue, itself an encapsulation of the entire covenant, into just sixteen Hebrew words, providing “the expression of the essence of all God’s person and purposes” (6:4-5).<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Named after the first Hebrew word in 6:4 (<em>shéma’</em>, “hear, pay attention”), the “Great Shema” has long been regarded as central to Deuteronomy and to Israelite theology and praxis.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> However, because of its brevity, the translation of the Shema (particularly 6:4) into English has been the topic of considerable debate. Although the initial imperative and vocative (“pay attention, Israel”) are clear enough, translating the remaining four terms (“Yahweh, our God, Yahweh, one”) into English involves making a decision on the placement of the copulative and the precise translation of <em>ekhad</em> as “one” or “alone.”<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<p>On balance, given the statement’s quasi-poetic brevity, it seems best to render 6:4: “Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is one.”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> This translation allows for a mediating position between Block’s arguments for rendering <em>ekhad</em> as “alone,” emphasizing God’s uniqueness, and Janzen’s arguments for God’s oneness as internal consistency and faithfulness to Israel.<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Compared to the gamut of Canaanite and other ancient Near Eastern deities, Yahweh was indeed unique,<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> primarily because of his faithfulness to Israel from the patriarchs (6:3b, 10a), through the exodus (6:12), and into the imminent conquest of Canaan (6:1b, 3, 10-11). That “Yahweh is one” is not so much an ontological statement as it is a historical reflection<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> in remembrance of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to his covenant people.</p>
<p>Therefore, in response to this unique faithfulness, Israel must love Yahweh absolutely (6:5), as seen by the concentric use of <em>lebab</em> (“heart,” the inner being, including emotion and intellect), <em>nephesh</em> (“soul,” the entire being, including desires), and <em>me’od</em> (“strength,” the physical being, including economic and social resources).<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> This is the only proper response to the God who is truly <em>ekhad</em> (6:4),<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> comprising the essential principle upon which the entire covenant rested.<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> Related to the previously mentioned fear of Yahweh and obedience to the covenant stipulations (6:1-3), loving Yahweh involves the epistemic/ontic response of internalizing (with the <em>lebab</em> and <em>nephesh</em>) and embodying (through the <em>me’od</em>) covenant faithfulness.</p>
<h1 id="extension-to-family-and-society--66-9">EXTENSION TO FAMILY AND SOCIETY – 6:6-9</h1>
<p>The proper love of Yahweh is absolute, permeating not only the entire person (6:5), but also all of life (6:6-9),<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> including the family unit (6:7) and society (6:8-9). Beginning again with the concept of epistemic internalization, Moses commands the Israelites to keep “these words” (referring to the entire covenant through the Shema)<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> on their hearts/minds (6:6).</p>
<p>This internalization of the covenant through constant reflection is then to be extended by teaching covenant faithfulness to future generations (6:7a), here described with an unusual verb (<em>shanan</em>) which evokes the imagery of engraving a message into stone.<a href="#_ftn20">[20]</a> Just as Moses is teaching the Israelites the covenant stipulations, they must teach these things to their children through constant repetition and discussion of the faithful covenant lifestyle within the household, reflected through the double merism of 6:7b (sitting/walking; lying down/getting up).<a href="#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Finally, this commitment to covenant faithfulness was to transcend the household and permeate the entire society (6:8-9). Although the instructions here (to “tie,” “fasten,” and “inscribe” the covenant stipulations on the forearm, forehead, and door frames, respectively) were taken literally in later Jewish tradition,<a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> they were probably meant to be interpreted metaphorically.<a href="#_ftn23">[23]</a> In this case, 6:8 refers to the embodiment of the covenant principles in everyday life, identifying each individual Israelite as a faithful covenant member.<a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a></p>
<p>However, in 6:9 the exhortation to covenant faithfulness is then expanded to the household and the community as “these words” (6:6) are inscribed “on the doorframes of your houses and gates” (6:9).<a href="#_ftn25">[25]</a> In response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, the Israelites are to love him absolutely by internalizing (6:6), embodying (6:8-9), and teaching (6:7) covenant faithfulness.</p>

<h1 id="warning-against-forgetful-idolatry-610-15">WARNING AGAINST FORGETFUL IDOLATRY: 6:10-15</h1>
<p>However, the proper love of Yahweh is also exclusive, for his uniqueness demands that he be worshipped alone. After distilling the covenant (6:4-5) and extending its essential claim to the family and society (6:6-9), Moses exhorts his audience to eschew all forms of forgetful idolatry. Instead, the Israelites are to love Yahweh exclusively as they inherit the blessings of the promised land, in remembrance of and in response to his unique faithfulness (6:10-15).</p>
<p>The historical context of this passage is especially important for the interpretation of 6:10-11. Moses reminds the Israelites of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness by linking the divine promises of land to the patriarchs with the fulfillment of those promises in the imminent conquest and occupation of Canaan.<a href="#_ftn26">[26]</a> The concrete description of the promised land in 6:10b-11 was designed to remind the audience that it was a blessing and a gift from Yahweh in faithful fulfillment of his kingly duties.<a href="#_ftn27">[27]</a> The warning in 6:12 to “be careful” reveals Moses’ anxiety that the sudden affluence the Israelites would experience in Canaan might lead them to forget their uniquely faithful God, who had redeemed them from the oppressive hand of the Egyptians and provided for them throughout the wilderness wanderings.<a href="#_ftn28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Therefore, 6:13 contains an intensely covenantal threefold call to the exclusive love of Yahweh alone.<a href="#_ftn29">[29]</a> As part of the proper response to Yahweh’s oneness (6:4), the Israelites are to fear only Yahweh, serve only Yahweh, and swear only by Yahweh’s name.<a href="#_ftn30">[30]</a> Moses then intensifies the warning even further in 6:14-15 with a rephrasing of the first two commandments (Deut 5:7-10).<a href="#_ftn31">[31]</a> On the basis of Yahweh’s righteous jealousy and the promised punishment of exile (5:9; 6:15; cf. 28:63; Lev 26:43), the Israelites are to love Yahweh exclusively by completely eschewing all forms of foreign idolatry (6:14).<a href="#_ftn32">[32]</a></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>As an introduction to the main exposition of the general covenant stipulations (Deut 6-11), Moses begins with an exhortation, calling the Israelites to the proper internalized and embodied response to Yahweh’s commands, statutes, and ordinances: covenant faithfulness as they enter the promised land (6:1-3). Then, he presents the distilled essence of the covenant principles in 6:4-5: the demand for the absolute love of Yahweh on the basis of his unique faithfulness.</p>
<p>This essential covenant claim is then extended to the family unit and society in 6:6-9 as the Israelites are commanded to internalize, embody, and teach covenant faithfulness to future generations.</p>
<p>Finally, in 6:10-15, in anticipation of the conquest of Canaan as a revelation of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to the patriarchs and the nation, the people are sternly warned to eschew all forms of forgetful idolatry and instead to worship Yahweh alone.</p>
<p>Therefore, taken as a whole, Deuteronomy 6:1-15 was written to teach its original audience that, <em>in remembrance of and in response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, they were to love Yahweh absolutely and exclusively by internalizing, embodying, and teaching covenant faithfulness as they inherited the blessings of the promised land.</em></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> The relevant sections are: Historical Prologue – Deut 1-3; Laws/Treaty Stipulations – chs. 4-26; Document Clause – 27:3; 31:9-13; Blessings – 28:1-14; and Curses – 28:15-68. Gordon J. Wenham proposes this structural approach to the Deuteronomic covenant in <em>A Guide to the Pentateuch</em> (vol. 1 of <em>Exploring the Old Testament</em>; Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 2002), 125. The similarities between Deuteronomy and ANE suzerain-vassal treaties are also noted by Eugene E. Carpenter in “Deuteronomy,” in <em>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy</em> (ed. John H.

<p><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> Throughout this study, I assume Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy. Furthermore, I assume that the passage at hand was originally composed just prior to Moses’ death and the subsequent conquest of Canaan. With regards to setting, Carpenter places Moses in the plains of Moab on the eastern side of the Jordan River in either 1406 or 1229 B.C. The earliest extra-biblical account of the Israelites in Canaan, a stele erected by Merneptah in western Thebes, mentions them already in the land in 1209 B.C (Cf. Carpenter, 420).</p>

Merrill notes this as the standard reference to the covenant stipulations as opposed to the Decalogue or the law as a whole (<em>Deuteronomy</em> (NAC 4; Nashville: Broadman &amp; Holman, 1994), 160).

      <title>You&#39;re Reading Romans 13 Wrong! Here&#39;s How to Read It Correctly</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.</p>
<p>Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.</p>
<p>An adequate case study of this phenomenon is the interpretation(s) of Romans 13:1-7, a text that has been used to justify everything from utter obedience to totalitarian regimes to unquestioning support of harsh anti-immigration laws. These seven verses from Paul’s epistle to the Romans have been grossly abused at numerous points since their original composition.</p>
<p>In Romans 13:1-7, Paul exhorts the Roman believers to apply his previous commands toward love (12:9), harmony (12:16), and peace (12:18) in the context of obedience to government (13:1-5) and the payment of taxes (13:6-7).</p>
<p>Far from being a comprehensive condensation of the apostle’s beliefs regarding any and all governments past and present, this passage is a specific and historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, discouraging them from political unrest, disobedience, and rebellion in order to protect their testimony and the effectiveness of the Roman church in the gospel mission.</p>
<p>This thesis will be “proven” by appealing to the historical context of the original audience and the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10 in which this passage rests.</p>
<p>(For more on the book of Romans, check out <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2015/10/03/faithful-faith-in-a-faithful-god-romans-1-1-17/">my sermon on Romans 1:1-17</a>. Looking for a great commentary on Romans? <a href="https://amzn.to/3S1KBB1">Read this one by Doug Moo</a> [affiliate link]!)</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2>
<p>When Romans 13:1-7 is read as if it was written in a modern North American context, it seems as though Paul is appealing to the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations to remind us of the divinely-appointed nature of our free-market economy and federal constitutional republic.</p>
<p>All of this is supposedly done to prompt us toward active participation in our civil government and unquestioning obedience to all of its laws. After all, these verses come up in discussions of Christian political involvement, debates on just war theory vs. pacifism, and diatribes against illegal immigrants and those who desire to aid them.</p>
<p>However, using these seven verses as a packet theology of church and state is problematic, even within the Pauline corpus alone. The same man who wrote Romans 13 also frequently took up themes in his writings that would challenge the power and authority of the Roman Empire, for the declaration that Jesus is Lord contains the implicit declaration that Caesar is not. Our understanding of these seven verses must, therefore, be able to mesh with other passages (such as Phil 2:6-11; 3:20-21; 1 Thess 1:9-10; and 4:13-5:11) and their implications on relations between church and state.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Many commentators in recent years have recognized the importance of interpreting this passage in light of its historical context at the time of its composition (c. A.D. 57<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>), instead of assuming that these verses are Paul’s fundamental views on how church and state should relate to each other.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Knowledge of the situation facing the Roman Christians in A.D. 57 is crucial to the interpretation of this text. Emperor Claudius had expulsed Jews from the city of Rome in A.D. 49, removing Jewish believers from the Roman church and therefore leaving only Gentile Christians behind in their stead.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>However, Claudius was killed by his wife Agrippina in A.D. 54, and her son Nero advanced to the throne that same year, immediately allowing the Jews to return to the city. When Romans was written by Paul in A.D. 57, the Empire enjoyed a period of peace that looked quite different from the chaos that would characterize the later years of Nero’s reign.</p>
<p>Guided by his advisor Seneca, Nero made promises of a different and better peace than the <em>pax romana</em> of Augustus. He promised true peace, characterized by restraint and the peaceful resistance to using force in order to govern. While these promises were dashed beginning in A.D. 59, with Nero’s matricide, the loss of his advisors, and the beginning of his persecution of Christians, it is crucial to remember that Paul wrote Romans during the period of hopeful peace from A.D. 54-59.</p>
<p>Romans 13:1-7 should not, therefore, be interpreted as if it were written to Roman believers in the later years of Nero’s reign, when persecution and oppression were rampant, for this would unduly strengthen Paul’s “pro-Empire” sentiments here.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>With this background information, it is easy to see why Paul here gives advice to his readers, a cosmopolitan church in Rome struggling to figure out Jew-Gentile dynamics in the early years of Nero’s reign, so as to prevent them from drawing negative attention to themselves and damaging the effectiveness of the gospel mission.</p>
<p>Although things were presumably “going well,” as mentioned above, Paul knew full well that things could get tense for the Roman believers very quickly. Despite the period of relative peace from A.D. 54-59, tensions were rising in Rome in A.D. 57-58 regarding the particularly nasty practice of indirect taxation. Furthermore, the Jewish believers who had returned to the city in A.D. 54 might not have been on the best terms with neither the Roman authorities nor the Gentile believers. Much of what Paul has to say in this epistle speaks to this issue: the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians within the Roman context.</p>
<p>It is not, therefore, unreasonable to assume that this played a role in the social tension Paul here addresses in Romans 13:1-7. Furthermore, revolutionary sentiments were in vogue at this time among the Jews in Palestine, and Paul was perhaps worried that the fervor would spread to the Roman church and quickly create some serious problems given the tensions within the church and its social context.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Positively, then, when Romans was written, the original audience enjoyed a period of relative peace and stability before the chaotic upheaval that would take place in A.D. 59.</p>
<p>Negatively, there was still quite a bit of tension within and around the Roman church which had the potential to divide the church and get the Christians in serious trouble with Roman authorities if rebellion became the rallying cry for the followers of Jesus, assured of the lordship of their King and the reality of his kingdom.</p>
<p>It is therefore a mistake to read Romans 13:1-7 as a justification of the sins of the state, as if this passage gave a carte blanche to the atrocities to be committed in the later years of Nero’s reign. Paul was capable of saying negative things about pagan governments when they were going awry<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>, but he nevertheless appealed to God’s sovereignty over human governments in order to prevent the tense situation of his audience from erupting into a social upheaval that would wreck the church’s testimony and hinder the gospel mission in the city of Rome and the empire over which that city ruled.</p>
<p>His audience then (and readers of the epistle today) would not, therefore, be expected to never challenge the government or abstain from promoting or participating in its practices, as Romans 13:1-7 has often been used to argue. Instead, they were (and are) to wisely interact with human governments, not seeking to cause any trouble in society that would damage their testimony, but not hesitating to stand firm in the cause of Christ their King when human governments do things contrary to the kingdom of God.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Wright pulls these themes together quite well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]recisely because of all the counter-imperial hints Paul has given not only in this letter and elsewhere but indeed by his entire gospel, it is vital that he steer Christians away from the assumption that loyalty to Jesus would mean the kind of civil disobedience and revolution that merely reshuffles the political cards into a different order. […] The main thing Paul wants to emphasize is that, <em>even though Christians are servants of the Messiah, the true lord, this does not give them carte blanche to ignore the temporary subordinates whose appointed task, whether (like Cyrus) they know it or not, is to bring at least a measure of God’s order and justice to the world. The church must live as a sign of the kingdom yet to come, but since that kingdom is characterized by justice, peace, and joy in the Spirit [14.17], it cannot be inaugurated in the present by violence and hatred</em>.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sentiments and those outlined above will now be augmented by a brief examination of Roman 13:1-7 within the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p>
<h2 id="scriptural-context-romans-129-1310">Scriptural Context: Romans 12:9-13:10</h2>
<p>The passage at hand only makes sense within the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10. Although Paul undoubtedly changes topics at 13:1, the thematic links between 13:1-7 and 12:9-21 are difficult to ignore. KakoV (“evil”) and agaqoV (“good”) occur in Rom 12:17, 21 and 13:3-4. Orgh (“wrath”) is mentioned in 12:19 and 13:4, 5. Also, conceptually, vengeance is mentioned in 12:19 and 13:4.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> It is therefore quite reasonable to see a connection between 13:1-7 and 12:9-21.</p>
<p>The links between this passage and the one immediately preceding it, however, should not overshadow the importance of the thematic verses earlier in 12:1-2. There Paul effectively redefines the people of God as no longer just Jews, but Gentiles as well. This is a common enough theme throughout the entire epistle and in almost all of Paul’s writings,<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> but in Romans 12:1-15:13, it is of particular importance.</p>
<p>Having spent the first eleven chapters of the epistle explaining the identity of the people of God as a mix of Jews and Gentiles and defending the covenant loyalty of God in the process, Paul now devotes chapters 12-15 to redefining the “rule of life” of the people of God.<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> In 12:9-21, Paul proclaims “love as the fundamental moral imperative in human relationships,”<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> urging his readers to pursue harmony (12:16) and peace (12:18). He then redefines in 13:1-7 how the people of God in the church at Rome should relate to the power structures of the society in which they dwell.</p>
<p>Romans 12:9-21 is one of the most loosely-constructed passages in the entire epistle. This means that it would take quite a bit of time and space to comprehensively analyze the syntax and detailed meaning of the passage. However, some general observations are in order.</p>
<p>The thematic verse of this paragraph is 12:9 (NET)<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a>, “Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.” From there, Paul emphasizes the important manifestations of genuine love: mutual devotion and eagerness in showing honor (12:10), enthusiastic spiritual service (12:11), hopeful joy and persistent prayer in the face of suffering (12:12), and hospitably meeting the needs of the saints (12:13). Harmony is commanded within and outside the church, extending even to persecutors (12:14, 16). Instead of responding in kind to their persecutors and therefore being “overcome by evil” (12:21a), Paul urges them to live peaceably (12:17-18), forbidding them from taking vengeance into their own hands (12:19). Instead, the Roman believers are to “overcome evil with good” (12:21b), and this is illustrated in 12:20, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will be heaping burning coals on his head.”</p>
<p>At this point after 12:21, most modern English readers of Scripture are confronted by a large “13” and perhaps a subject heading, such as “Submission to Civil Government.” The advantages of verse and chapter divisions for Bible reading and study are well-known. However, the chapter division here has had detrimental effects on the exegesis of this passage.</p>
<p>Although seemingly a very minor change, it puts undue emphasis on Paul’s supposed change of topic, prompting the interpretations of many that this is Paul’s comprehensive theology of church and state relations, ignoring the passage’s context and the historical situation of the original audience, who would have heard this epistle read without the explanation of a chapter division or sub-heading.</p>
<p>Romans 13:1-7 is most naturally read as the unpacking of the principles of 12:9-21, in the context of how Christians in Rome should behave in relation to the powers that governed the society in which they dwelt. It answers the implied question (after reading 12:9-21): “Paul, if we are to do these things (love genuinely, pursue harmony and peace, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good, etc.), how should this apply in regards to our relationship with the rulers of our city and empire?”</p>
<p>The specific rules that governed the theocracy of ancient Israel no longer held sway for the international and multi-ethnic body of Christ. As noted above, the situation in Rome, although relatively peaceful, was still quite tense within and outside of the church. Jews and Gentiles were struggling to remain unified in the Messiah in spite of their cultural differences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jews in Rome, only recently allowed back into the city, may have been culturally stigmatized as superstitious and unwanted. Tensions were building because of indirect taxation. And Jews in Palestine were growing more and more rebellious.<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>It is not therefore hard to imagine why Paul felt the pastoral need to apply the principles of 12:9-21 to the realm of society and government. A “perfect storm” was brewing underneath the surface, one that could put the Christians in Rome at odds with not only each other but with the Roman Empire itself very quickly if the believers there tended towards promoting social unrest, perhaps due to an over-realized eschatology that would want to usher in the kingdom of God by overthrowing Roman rule. If the Christians in Rome made a wrong move, evil could quickly overcome them.</p>
<p>While a full analysis of the argument of the text at hand is beyond the scope of this essay, a brief trace of the thought-flow of Romans 13:1-7 will aid in comprehension of its contextually-appropriate meaning. The general command to submit to the authorities is found in 13:1a, and is reiterated in 13:5.</p>
<p>The first reason for this submission is that the authorities have been appointed by God (13:1b). Logically, then, those who oppose the authorities oppose “the ordinance of God” (13:2b). The consequence of disobeying the general command is therefore God’s judgment<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> (13:2b).</p>
<p>The second reason for submission is that the rulers are servants of God to commend good and to administer retribution to evil, although these two verses can also be seen as support for the claim that those who resist the authorities can expect judgment on earth<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> (13:3-4).</p>
<p>Paul then restates the main thesis of 13:1-4 in 13:5, urging his readers to submit because of “wrath” (they would face judgment if disobedient) and “conscience” (they would be opposing God’s ordinance). He then closes this paragraph with an appeal to the readers’ current practice of paying taxes in submission to the government (13:6), urging them therefore to continue respectfully in what they have already been doing (13:7).<a href="#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>When unhindered by the chapter division, it is easy to see how Romans 13:1-7 relates to 12:9-21. The genuine love commanded in 12:9a would be quite hard to apply to the impersonal institution of the Roman government. On the other hand, it would have been quite easy for the rebellious attitudes of the Jews in Palestine to seep into the Roman context, prompting the Roman Christians to rebel and try and institute the kingdom of God in opposition to Roman rule.</p>
<p>Paul steps in and applies the principles of non-violence, non-retribution, and enemy love (12:14, 17, 18-20) to the context of government and society. In order to “overcome evil with good” (12:21) when it came to the Roman powers, the believers in Rome were not to rebel violently or cause unnecessary civil unrest, but to submit to the governing authorities (13:1a) with the acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty over the said powers (13:1b).</p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to go to the other end of the spectrum and argue that Paul is urging his audience to give unthinking and critical approval of everything the Roman government did. As mentioned above, Paul was more than willing to critique governments and empires for the sake of God’s kingdom and the cause of Christ.</p>
<p>It would also be a mistake to argue that Romans 13:1-7 is a justification for the active participation in government activities (political office, warfare, etc.) both ancient and modern. Although God is still sovereign over modern nations, Paul’s argument here does not address the issue of active Christian participation in government because that was not on the radar of first-century Christian life in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Instead, Paul’s main point is that his readers should not revolt, but that they should instead stay out of trouble by obeying the authorities and participating in the basic constructs of their society (i.e. paying taxes).</p>
<p>The argument for placing 13:1-7 in the overarching context of Paul’s focus on genuine love in 12:9-13:10 is strengthened by his return to the topic of love in 13:8-10. After the sobering instruction to not rebel but to stay out of trouble and obey the governing authorities, Paul reminds his audience of the importance of love, not only of enemy (of which it could be strongly argued that the governing authorities were a subset!), but of neighbor.</p>
<p>This returns the Roman Christians’ focus to love as the central virtue of Christianity and the “fulfillment of the law” (13:8, 10). They were to faithfully follow Jesus the Messiah King, seeking to bring in his kingdom. But it was unthinkable to Paul to effect God’s kingdom in a way that ran against the grain of that kingdom of love, justice, and peace. Therefore, in the middle of exhortations to genuinely love one’s enemies and neighbors, Paul urges his audience to humbly obey their governing authorities so that they might remain faithful to their King’s calling as they went about his work in the city of Rome.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through the ignorance of the historical background of Paul’s epistle to the Romans as a whole and his instructions in Romans 13:1-7 in particular, the passage at hand has been grossly mis-read and mis-applied in numerous ways since its original composition. Instead of an argument for unthinking obedience to, approval of, and participation in governments past and present, Paul here argues for the Christians in Rome not to revolt against the empire in an attempt to fully usher in God’s kingdom, but to submit humbly to the Roman authorities as they sought to overcome evil with good.</p>
<p>Having an understanding of both the historical background and the context of this passage in the overall argument of the epistle yields an appropriately nuanced view of Paul’s pastoral concern for his audience expressed in these seven controversial verses. Although it is tempting to take this passage out of context and use it to justify opinions on everything from immigration to just war theory, the same hubris that Paul implicitly rebukes in these verses must be resisted if the Scriptures are to be heard and appropriated well.</p>
<p>While some may wish that Romans 13:1-7 had more to say regarding the relationship between church and state, the passage certainly cannot say less than the main points briefly described above. Romans 13:1-7 is not a condensed theology of church and state, but a specific historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, diverting them from rebellion and urging them towards humble submission in order to protect their testimony and thereby enhance their effectiveness in God’s redemptive mission.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> A full analysis of the legitimacy of an anti-imperial Pauline hermeneutic far exceeds the scope of this study. Wright (2004: 82-88 and 2005: 69-79) emphasizes what he sees to be Paul’s anti-imperial themes throughout his writings, and I am indebted to him for the concept of Jesus’ vs. Caesar’s lordship. For an even-handed overview and analysis of this topic, consult Kim (2008), who makes the case that a strong anti-imperial Pauline hermeneutic is difficult to maintain. Despite Kim’s conclusions, however, it seems unwise to completely ignore the implications of Christ’s lordship on both Roman believers in the first century and on North American ones today. The fact that Romans 13:1-7 is such a stumbling block to those in the anti-imperial camp and such an “anomaly” when compared with the implications of Paul’s anti-imperial passages (such as 1 Thess 5, alluded to by Wright [2005]) seems to necessitate a nuanced approach that hears the arguments of those on both sides of this theological debate.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2">[2]</a> The commentaries and resources consulted in this study provided A.D. 57 as a consensus view of the date of composition of Paul’s epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref3">[3]</a> (Kim 2008: 37), who points to P. Stuhlmacher, <em>Paul’s Letter to the Romans: A Commentary</em>, trans. S. J. Hafeman (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox, 1994), 198-208; J. A. Fitzmyer, <em>Romans</em> AB 33 (New York: Doubleday, 1993), 662-63. Also, consult Dunn (1988: 768-69).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref4">[4]</a> Ibid., 37.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref5">[5]</a> The background information in this paragraph comes from the helpful discussion in Witherington III (2004: 304-6).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref6">[6]</a> Consult the discussion in Kim (2008: 37) for a helpful counterbalance to the optimistic portrait painted by Witherington III (2004: 304-6). I am also very much indebted to the discussion as the source of the historical information in this paragraph.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref7">[7]</a> Cf. Witherington III (2004: 307): “That Paul could say very different and negative things about the state when the state was malfunctioning at the end of Claudius’ reign seems clear enough from 1 and 2 Thessalonians, particularly in 2 Thessalonians 2.” And also consider Wright’s (2004: 86) insistence that Paul had the ability to critique human government: “…in those stories (his visit to Philippi in Acts 16, for instance, or his trial before the Jewish authorities in Acts 23), that precisely when the authorities are getting it all wrong and acting illegally or unjustly Paul has no hesitation in telling them their proper business and insisting that they should follow it.”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref8">[8]</a> <strong>Passionate Aside:</strong> The main problem, then, in applying this passage today, is a very narrow vision of what God’s kingdom entails. That is, “obey your government unless it tells you to do something contrary to the Word of God” is a common enough teaching in the church today, but our vision of God’s redemptive mission is so emaciated that it causes us to miss glaring issues of concern (immigration, warfare, racism, etc.) in our society today. We rape the Scriptures when Romans 13:1-7 is used to justify such ignorance of and even the active participation in streams of society, culture, and policy which go against the grain of God’s kingdom.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref9">[9]</a> (Wright 2005: 78-79), emphasis mine.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref10">[10]</a> I am indebted to Dr. Robert Milliman and his blog-post <em>Love and War: Romans 13.1 – 7 in the Context of 12.9 – 13.10</em> (2011) for the initial idea of examining this passage in its context to avoid mis-readings of the text which have been used to justify everything from totalitarian regimes to Christian service in the military.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref11">[11]</a> Schreiner (1998: 678) provides these examples of textual and conceptual links between the two passages. Dunn (1988: 758) also mentions the phrases ekdikew / ekdikoV (12:19; 13:4) and pantwn anqrwpwn / pasin (12:17-18; 13:7) to provide evidence for a link between the two passages, before demonstrating links between Romans 2:7-11 and 13:3-4 in order to refute the claims of some that this passage is a non-Pauline insertion.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref12">[12]</a> I appeal to Dr. Chris Miller’s class notes from BENT 4110 – <em>Romans and Galatians</em> (Spring 2012), and also Wright’s work on Romans (2004) to prove this point, for a complete discussion of this common theme exceeds the scope of this essay. However, for an overview of this theme in Romans, Dunn (1988: 705) cites Rom 1:16-17; 2:15, 17, 28-29; 3:20, 29; 4:16; 9:8, 12; 11:6, 30-32.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref13">[13]</a> Dunn (1988: 705) sees chapters 12-15 as providing a replacement to Lev 18:5 (“this do and live”) as the rule of life for the people of God: “…‘the walk in newness of life’ as over against the walk in the ordinances of Israel’s law (6:4), the service in newness of Spirit as over against oldness of letter (7:6), the obedience of faith in accord with the Spirit fulfilling the requirement of the law unconfused with Jewish ‘works’ (8:4).”</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref14">[14]</a> Ibid., 706.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref15">[15]</a> All Bible quotations, unless otherwise noted, come from the NET Bible.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref16">[16]</a> Here I summarize my conclusions from “Historical Background” above.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref17">[17]</a> Schreiner (1998: 679) notes that there is considerable debate as to whether this refers to the eschatological judgment of God or to judgment imposed by earthly rulers. He appeals to the structure of the text (gar in 3a) to conclude that the latter option is more likely.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref18">[18]</a> Ibid., 680.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref19">[19]</a> I am indebted to Moo (1996: 794) and Schreiner (1998: 680) for this overview of the passage’s argument.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To my sisters and brothers in Christ, entrusted with the arduous task of leading and directing Cedarville University: greetings, grace, and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to thank you all for your countless hours of service to this institution. I do not want to underestimate your care and concern for this place. In fact, I want to reassure you that &lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/&#34; title=&#34;My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience&#34;&gt;I share your passion&lt;/a&gt;. Here at Cedarville I have been blessed with the opportunity of meeting, falling in love with, and marrying my wife. Even more importantly, at Cedarville I have fallen in love with the Gospel. Thanks to godly men and women here – whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I’ve been privileged to catch – my eyes have been opened to the richness, complexity, and scope of God’s redemptive mission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To my sisters and brothers in Christ, entrusted with the arduous task of leading and directing Cedarville University: greetings, grace, and peace.</p>
<p>Allow me to thank you all for your countless hours of service to this institution. I do not want to underestimate your care and concern for this place. In fact, I want to reassure you that <a href="http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/" title="My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience">I share your passion</a>. Here at Cedarville I have been blessed with the opportunity of meeting, falling in love with, and marrying my wife. Even more importantly, at Cedarville I have fallen in love with the Gospel. Thanks to godly men and women here – whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I’ve been privileged to catch – my eyes have been opened to the richness, complexity, and scope of God’s redemptive mission.</p>
<p>I therefore raise the following concerns not as one who wants to malign Cedarville, disregard your wisdom, or perpetrate verbal violence. I raise them because I want Cedarville to contribute to God’s Kingdom to the fullest extent possible. I have invested four years of my life here as a CU Scholar, Getting Started Leader, Discipleship Leader, Student Grader, and Resident Assistant. I want future students, perhaps my own children someday, to be able to do the same. I want this University to thrive, inspiring true greatness for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>That is why certain events within the Cedarville community this past year have caused me such great <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">concern</a>. I say this as respectfully as possible: some of your decisions and actions seem to contradict the most precious lessons that I have learned at your institution about the Gospel.</p>
<p>Among other troubling things, including the harassment of those <em>“godly men and women here – whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I’ve been privileged to catch,”</em> I have observed <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/">the following:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>your approval of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/white-papers/">the White Papers</a> on <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Omniscience-White-Paper.pdf">omniscience</a>, <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Forensic-Justification.pdf">justification</a>, and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/~/media/Files/PDF/Shared/Creation-White-Paper.pdf">creation</a>,</li>
<li>your rejection of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/theology-major-rejected/">the proposed Theology Major</a>,</li>
<li>your dismissal of<a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/dr-michael-pahl-dismissed/"> Dr. Michael Pahl</a>,</li>
<li>the untimely resignation of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/concerns/dr-browns-resignation/">Dr. William Brown</a>,</li>
<li>the extremely untimely resignation of <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/ruby-resigns/">Dr. Carl Ruby</a>,</li>
<li>your imminent cancellation of the <a href="http://ourcuprotest.wordpress.com/">Philosophy Major</a>,</li>
<li>and subsequent imminent release of either Dr. Shawn Graves or Dr. David Mills.</li>
</ul>
<p>As your younger brother in Christ, I am obligated to approach you <em><strong>peacefully</strong></em>. However, given the circumstances, it seems I am also obligated to approach you <em><strong>prophetically</strong></em>. Because of the biblical concept of *<strong>shalom</strong> as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">true peace</span>, I believe I can do both at the same time. For <em>true peace</em> is not the absence of conflict or strong words, but the longing of the prophets for the time and place where the image-bearers of Yahweh will be reconciled to one another, to all of creation, and to God himself. It is the relational fullness and completeness of God’s justice-based, truth-filled, and transparent Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, then, I cry out for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>justice</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, I cry out for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>truth</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In the interests of <em>shalom</em>, I cry out for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>transparency</strong></span>.</p>
<p>For brevity’s sake, I’d like to distill my myriad concerns and frustrations into just two questions. After all, I’m just an undergraduate, and you do not owe me a thorough explanation of all the managerial minutiae behind your every move. However, you do owe me – along with current/future faculty, staff, students, and constituency – a thorough and impeccably honest explanation of <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cedarville University’s Identity and Vision</span></strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>In the interests of shalom, justice, truth, and transparency, I cry out for answer to the following two questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is Cedarville University?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What does Cedarville University hope to become?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All of your actions and decisions mentioned above, from the harassment of my mentors and friends to the proposed cancellation of the Philosophy Major, point towards Cedarville University being and becoming a <strong>fundamentalist</strong> (<em>euphemistically, a “conservative evangelical”)</em> <strong>institution</strong> – silencing honest dialogue, erecting thick walls between “us” and “them,” and carving out our own niche instead of engaging the unified diversity of God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>After all, Dr. Ruby and Dr. Brown were two of Cedarville’s most prominent voices calling for <strong>a robust evangelicalism, for this self-proclaimed liberal arts university to embrace and embody both cultural and ideological diversity – in the hopes of becoming one of the most influential Christ-centered learning communities in the twenty-first century.</strong></p>
<p>I and many others came to Cedarville University to study, work, and teach because we find this vision extremely compelling. We find things like poorly-written White Papers, inadequately explained rejections/cancellations of valuable majors, and questionable, sudden changes in beloved personnel much less compelling.</p>
<p>I will give you the benefit of the doubt and not discuss at-length the <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">many</span></strong></em> rumors and reports of shameful things like <em>ad hoc</em> and biased “review” panels, bullying, power plays, and gag orders. If the rumors be true, then perhaps someone much higher than I should call for your repentance, if not your resignations. Such is the high responsibility of having “<em>For the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus Christ</em>” as your institutional motto.</p>
<p>However, I will ask you for one important thing: <strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">your honesty about where you want to take Cedarville University</span></em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span></strong></p>
<p>Here’s why: as the Administration and Board of Trustees, you have a certain right to decide whether or not Cedarville will be robustly evangelical or fundamentalist. We might strongly disagree about which of those two options is preferable, but at the end of the day you make that decision, not I.</p>
<p>However, you have no right to <strong>obfuscate</strong> or <strong>vacillate</strong> on these important matters of identity and vision. While I can’t tell you what direction to take this University, I can boldly ask that <strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">you decide and then very clearly and publicly announce your decision</span></em>.</strong></p>
<p>Even if I and many others disagree with your decision, we will respect you much more for your clarity. Trying to accomplish your goals behind the scenes has only resulted in confusion, damage, and pain to several individuals and families within the Cedarville community. In the wake of Dr. Pahl’s dismissal and the questionable resignations of Dr. Brown and Dr. Ruby, we need a clear statement, not a polished and vague press release. If you don’t plainly declare your position and objectives, then we will be forced to assume the worst regarding your motives.</p>
<p>After all, if achieving your goals involves getting rid of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Michael Pahl</strong></em>, an outstanding biblical theologian of whom you were willing to say: “[his] orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility. He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students.”</li>
<li><em><strong>William Brown</strong></em>, the president and beloved face of Cedarville University for thousands of students.</li>
<li>and <em><strong>Carl Ruby</strong></em>, a man whose respect and admiration from students, faculty, and staff transcend cultural, theological, and political dispositions…a preeminent model of Christ-like service, love, patience, respect, grace, and wisdom…and a pioneer for open and honest dialogue for the sake of God’s Kingdom.</li>
</ul>
<p>…then your goals are probably in need of <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">revision</span></strong>, but they are most certainly in need of <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">immediate clarification</span></strong>.</p>
<p>For the sake of our Messiah, Savior, Lord, and King whose crown our University bears on its seal, I appeal to you as your younger brother in the faith: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">publicly declare your vision for the future of Cedarville University</span>. In the face of the growing angst, confusion, and frustration among students, alumni, faculty, staff, and constituency, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">explicitly state who you do and do not want working, teaching, and therefore studying at the University.</span></p>
<p>It is my prayer that, as a result of your honesty and transparency, Cedarville University might become a more peaceful and just community in the midst of God’s shalom-filled Kingdom.</p>
<p>For King and Kingdom,</p>
<p>Joshua Steele</p>
<p>Cedarville University Class of 2013</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: I’ve been blogging in order to raise awareness of Cedarville University’s recent dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl from his teaching post. Using the University’s statement on Dr. Pahl, I’ve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above (<em>in the statement</em>, orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University?</li>
<li>Don’t we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m writing today because the responses I’ve gotten to those posts and questions have been mixed. Some think I’m doing something that is both <em>righteous</em> and <em>necessary</em>, respectfully raising awareness and asking uncomfortable-yet-necessary questions. Others think I’m being <em>un</em>-biblical and <em>disrespectful</em> in my approach, and that I should handle these matters privately (cf. <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3AMatthew%2018%3A15-net_strongs__notes%3AMatthew%2018">Matt 18:15-22</a> and such).</p>
<p>Clearly, I’m a bit biased toward the first reaction. It’s always more pleasant to think of your actions as both righteous and necessary, after all. However, that doesn’t negate the careful line to walk in this situation. Several things must be held in Christ-honoring tension, such as <strong>boldness</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>respect</strong>, <strong>honesty</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>love</strong>, <strong>persistence</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>patience</strong>, a hunger for <strong>justice</strong> <em>and</em> an even <em>stronger</em> craving for <strong>God’s perfect <em>shalom</em> peace</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve been personally challenged by <a href="http://rustlingsinthegrass.blogspot.com/2012/09/friday-reflectionary-psalm-54.html?spref=tw">Dr. Pahl’s recent blog post</a>. How, in the face of injustice, are we to hold <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3APsalms%2054%3A0-net_strongs__search%3APsalm%2054">David’s cries for vengeance in Psalm 54</a> in tension with <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3ARomans%2012%3A9-net_strongs__search%3ARomans%2012%3A9">Paul’s calls for peace in Romans 12:14, 17a?</a> Consider this quote from Dr. Pahl’s conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When we experience injustice, then, we are to follow in the footsteps of Jesus.</strong></p>
<p><em>We cry out to God in our suffering, even in the raw depths of our agony, trusting God to walk with us through the suffering, entrusting our vindication to God in his timing and his way.</em></p>
<p><em>We speak truth to ourselves and to others, even to those who have committed the injustice, even to those in power, naming sin and evil for what it is.</em></p>
<p><em>We resist evil by refusing to engage in evil acts ourselves; we resist violence done to us by refusing to engage in violence ourselves, whether violent actions or violent words. Instead, we engage in acts of self-giving, life-giving love for the other.</em></p>
<p><em>And through it all we remind ourselves of our own sin, now forgiven, as we see the sin of others against us, waiting to be forgiven.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His words above, along with Dr. Tim Gombis’ words in <a href="http://timgombis.com/2012/09/18/the-logic-of-religious-violence/">“The Logic of Religious Violence”</a> are at the front of mind as I pursue these issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christians, however, must draw upon God’s grace to remain in the shape of the cross even when our survival appears to be at stake, or when things appear to be out of control in our culture. Remaining in the shape of the cross (refusing to retaliate, returning evil with good, loving those who hate us, controlling ourselves to speak kindly to those with whom we disagree) embodies faith in the resurrection and trust in God’s sovereignty. […]</p>
<p>Let’s remember that cruciformity is the only way of hope and promise for those who confess loyalty to the Lord Christ. The way of violence (rhetorical and physical) is only and always the way of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If anyone suggests that I somehow hate Cedarville University and am merely trying to damage its reputation, that simply is not true. On the contrary, I have a deep love for Cedarville. I have been richly blessed by God during my time here, and it is my sincere hope that the students who come after me have the chance to grow and thrive even more than I have. If you don’t believe me, please read my previous post, <a href="http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/" title="My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience">“My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience.”</a></p>
<p>Dr. Pahl’s dismissal, therefore, concerns me precisely <strong>because</strong> I care about Cedarville University. While I do not want to respond to what I believe is injustice with rhetorical violence of my own, I also do not want to ignore the dismissal of a godly professor over one of the best books I have ever read (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270"><em>The Beginning and The End</em></a>, with its remarkably non-incendiary handling of two of the most vitriolic areas of Christian doctrine).</p>
<p>Furthermore, I do not believe that the principles of Matthew 18:15-22 directly apply in this situation. This is not an interpersonal conflict I have with a brother or sister in Christ, this is an institution’s action which I believe to be both unjust and troubling.</p>
<p>Yes, Cedarville University is a very visible Christ-centered learning community, and it should be treated with respect and dignity. I do not want to needlessly damage its reputation, especially in the eyes of non-believers. However, Cedarville is an organization, and as such it needs to be held to a high standard when it comes to things like truth, justice, and transparency…especially <em><strong>because</strong></em> it claims to be a <em><strong>Christ</strong></em>-centered community!</p>
<p>In closing, two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If godly professors like Dr. Pahl can write a book the quality of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270"><em>The Beginning and the End</em></a>, and even be praised (in the statement regarding his dismissal, no less) as <em>orthodox</em> and committed to <em>Scripture,</em> the <em>gospel</em>, promising <em>scholarship</em>, and dedicated <em>teaching</em>, and <em><strong>still</strong></em> be relieved from teaching duties, then no faculty member is safe. This move does not seem to promote the gospel, God’s kingdom, or even academic freedom…it instead promotes a culture of fear and “us” vs. “them.” That’s why we need things like truth and transparency after something like this happens.</li>
<li>If students like myself cannot respectfully-yet-openly question such events out of concern for not only professors like Dr. Pahl, but for the entire institution’s future and health, something is wrong. And if we are instead punished, censored, or encouraged toward indifference, something is <em><strong>profoundly</strong></em> wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please hold me accountable to my desires to honor Christ in this endeavor. He is my King and deserves my full allegiance. And please, if you claim the name of Christ, <em><strong>care</strong></em> about matters such as this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it’s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it’s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it’s indifference.”<br>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;further-questions-all-relating-to-the-university-statement-on-dr-pahls-dismissal&#34;&gt;Further Questions, All Relating to the University Statement on Dr. Pahl’s Dismissal:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Dr. Pahl’s book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beginning and the End&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was controversial enough to lead to his dismissal, why was the book allowed to be used as a textbook last school year?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shouldn’t we trust the Bible professors’ judgment in their selection of the book as a text?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we should, then was it worth firing Dr. Pahl over a book which other CU professors approved of enough to require as a text for their courses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, why not? Why don’t we trust these highly-trained men and women as an institution? Shouldn’t they be a resource instead of a feared danger? Does this potential fear have anything to do with Dr. Pahl being dismissed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do all members of the Board of Trustees agree with “each and every position of Cedarville University’s Doctrinal Statement” in the way Dr. Pahl was expected to in order to still be allowed to teach?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If he was dismissed, despite the apparent alignment of his personal views and those expressed in his writing to the Doctrinal Statement, is there a possibility that some of the trustees should also be dismissed according to such strict standards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was Dr. Pahl dismissed for something that wrote which contradicts the Doctrinal Statement? If so, what was it exactly that he wrote? (I have been unable to find anything in &lt;em&gt;The Beginning and the End&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Dr. Pahl was not fired for something he wrote, was he fired for something that he &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;write? Again, if so, what was it exactly that he didn’t affirm?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthermore, is firing someone for not affirming something fair? Are all professors required to affirm the Doctrinal Statement in its entirety in everything they write and/or publish?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the administration’s vision for the future of the Bible Department at Cedarville University?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does firing an orthodox, promising scholar who is committed to Scripture and to the gospel help to achieve that vision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has Dr. Pahl been cared for by the University in any way during this process? As our brother in Christ, have we dismissed him in a way that is honoring to God and helpful to him and his family?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What explanation has been given to the students who have been affected by Dr. Pahl’s dismissal (i.e. the ones registered for his classes)? Has that explanation been accurate and forthright?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are any other professors currently being considered for dismissal by the University for things they have written and published?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<li>Despite the Following:

<li>The administration and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx">trustees </a>of Cedarville University have <span style="text-decoration:underline;">“relieved” Dr. Pahl of his teaching duties. </span>

<ul>
<li>Why were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above (orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University?</li>
<li>Don’t we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not?</li>
<li>Upon review of Dr. Pahl’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270">book</a>, I do not see how it contradicts with any of the points of Cedarville’s doctrinal statement.
<ul>
<li>Have I missed something?</li>
<li>Are there more standards that the ones enumerated in the Doctrinal Statement that the professors are expected to hold to (i.e. White Papers)?</li>
<li>If so, why aren’t these made public? If the White Papers flow directly from the Doctrinal Statement, and if they are important enough to fire faculty over, then shouldn’t the students and general public know about them?</li>
<li>Is it possible that other motivations are at play here?</li>
<li>Does the “best interests of its constituency” imply that Dr. Pahl was dismissed from teaching because of non-doctrinal concerns?</li>
<li>Was this decision in any way motivated by attendance or enrollment or popularity of the institution in certain Christians’ eyes?</li>
<li>If that’s the case, then why would those things be worth more than “the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ” to the administration and the trustees?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What did “the review by the University administration and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx">trustees</a>” look like? Were the proceedings ethical? Were the proceedings made public in any way so as to provide for oversight?</li>
<li>What is the definition of “constituency” according to the statement above? Does it include the entire constituency of the University, or just a select portion?</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx&#34;&gt;the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization’s agenda, and &lt;strong&gt;how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism…&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx">the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24</a>, I’d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization’s agenda, and <strong>how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism</strong>.</p>
<p>I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism…</p>
<p>…and then I learned more about how to study the Bible.</p>
<p>And now I’m not so sure that people like Ken Ham are really about humbly submitting to what Scripture has to say. Instead, they seem to hold tightly to an anti-intellectual hermeneutic of suspicion and paranoia.It’s all about “us” vs. “them,” about building thick walls and banishing the “crazy liberals” from our midst. And the more I listen to the rhetoric, the more I’m convinced that <strong>anyone</strong> can become a crazy liberal, so long as they disagree with key figures such as Ken Ham about anything.</p>
<p>Consider the following quote from <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2011/11/03/anointed-evangelicals-and-authority-1-rjs/">a review of The Anointed: Evangelical Truth in a Secular Age (by R. Stephens and K. Giberson): </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ken Ham, with no scientific credentials, no credentials in biblical scholarship, no evidence, and no research program, has become the front person, the spokesman for a large segment of evangelicalism. He proves nothing, he asserts what he finds to be truth and tells a story to make it so. He is a charismatic speaker on a mission and has become for many the authority on the evil of evolution and the dishonesty of modern science. Ken Ham and his organization Answers in Genesis have become “<em>powerful shapers of popular opinion in America’s vast evangelical subculture.</em>”</p>
<p>Ken Ham is an anointed and respected authority in much of American evangelicalism and fundamentalism.</p>
<p>One of the premises of Stephens and Giberson is that the broader evangelical culture has become enamored of the charismatic individual who can tell a good story, do it in a flashy and entertaining fashion, and has a message easily reduced to simple black and white points. Ken Ham is such an individual.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why is Ken Ham believed?</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People like Ken Ham and AiG claim to have a <strong>high</strong> view of Scripture and to hold to a “literal” reading… but in reality, I think that they have a <strong>low</strong> view of Scripture because they are unwilling to even consider that certain passages were <em>not</em> written to answer the questions we might like them to answer for us! If we don’t even try to approach the text <em>on its own terms</em>, then I would argue that we’re being <em>unfaithful</em> to Scripture.</p>
<p>For those of you still reading who don’t think I’m a crazy liberal yet (I can assure you, I’m not), consider the following resources as first steps in moving beyond Ken Ham, AiG, and the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism, to what Scripture actually has to say about creation!</p>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;creation-and-redemption-christ-and-new-creation&#34;&gt;CREATION AND REDEMPTION: CHRIST AND NEW CREATION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Throughout the New Testament, the main use of creation theology is to link creation with redemption, resulting in the praise of the Creator through the Creator-Redeemer, Jesus the Messiah. However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions.[\[1\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1) The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple.[\[2\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2) Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.
&lt;p&gt;The New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17).&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation.&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4&#34;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20).&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5&#34;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; (poievw).&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6&#34;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h1 id="creation-and-redemption-christ-and-new-creation">CREATION AND REDEMPTION: CHRIST AND NEW CREATION</h1>
<div>Throughout the New Testament, the main use of creation theology is to link creation with redemption, resulting in the praise of the Creator through the Creator-Redeemer, Jesus the Messiah. However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions.[\[1\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1) The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple.[\[2\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2) Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.
<p>The New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]</a> Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]</a> Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both <em>made</em> (poievw).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Doxologically, the link between creation and redemption is hard to overemphasize, for it provides the explanation, impetus, and goal of worship. By creating anew through Jesus the Messiah, the perfect <em>Eikon</em><a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn7">[7]</a> or <em>Tselem</em> (image) of God who has defeated Sin and Death, Elohim has begun to renew his holy temple, even as it yearns for full release from its bondage to decay.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn8">[8]</a> This act of re-creation begins in the crucifixion and resurrection of the Messiah, reversing Death itself and displaying Jesus Christ as the pioneer of a new humanity, one untouched by God’s cosmic enemies. It continues in the Church, as the priest-kings are re-created <em>in Christ</em> <em>and his resurrection</em> into a new race of people able to worship their Maker by participating in the renewal of his universe, by once again extending his rule throughout the sacred realm, and by living in right relationship to him, to creation, to each other, and to themselves as they await the return of their Creator, Redeemer, and King, Jesus the Messiah.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>In light of these things, to relegate the manifold and rich uses of creation theology throughout Scripture to an ongoing origins debate which is thoroughly <em>detached</em> from the biblical text would be a tragedy. At the risk of oversimplification, the myriad creation themes in the Scriptures all lead to one common goal: doxology, as a brief analysis of just three of those themes has shown. Creation as temple provides the parameters for worship of the Creator, setting the foundation for humanity’s relational role as the priest-kings of Elohim. Creation as chaos reorients that worship toward humility and wonder in the midst of a purposefully untamed and sometimes dangerous temple, bringing the wildly complex beauty of Yahweh’s creation to bear on the human experience. Finally, creation as redemption ties the entire story together, explaining the Creator’s refusal to allow Sin and Death to drag his temple back to the watery depths of non-functionality. He has chosen to create anew, to redeem every aspect of his holy temple, from its priest-kings to its wild beauties, through Jesus the Messiah, the eternal intersection of Creator, creation, and redemption. This process of new creation began at the crucifixion and resurrection, continues through the Church, and anticipates the eschaton, when Sin and Death will not only be defeated, but utterly vanquished. The holy temple will again be filled with perfect worship, forever.</p>
<p><strong>It is <em>because of</em> and <em>within</em> this story of creation and new creation that we worship our Maker. Biblical creation theology inescapably leads to doxology.</strong></p>

Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory.

<p>Much of the chaos in the universe can be ascribed to the infiltration of Sin and Death as described in Genesis 3. However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God’s creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.</p>
<p>Yahweh’s “whirlwind speeches” in Job 38-41 are the longest sustained reflection on creation outside of Gen 1-3, and they depict a radically non-anthropocentric cosmos where the ferocity and freedom of non-human creatures is celebrated.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> Whereas other passages seem to portray humanity as the center of God’s attention, <a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2">[2]</a> in Job 38-41 Yahweh only mentions humans in passing, choosing instead to focus on the wildest aspects of his creation, such as the Behemoth (40:15-24), the Leviathan (41:1-34), and the Sea (38:8-11).</p>
<p>The Sea, in fact, bears special mention, for it was a symbol of chaos in the ANE, and in several ANE cosmogonies it had to be slain by the gods in the process of creation.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> Most notably, in the Babylonian <em>Enuma Elish</em>, the creator-goddess <em>Tiamat</em> (Sumerian for “salt water, deep, chaos”) is violently defeated by the warrior-god Marduk, who constructs the universe from her bloody corpse.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]</a> In the Genesis account, we see the cognate Hebrew term: תְּהוֹם (<em>tehom</em>), the “watery depths” of Gen 1:2. Although there are echoes of the Marduk-Tiamat battle elsewhere in Scripture,<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]</a> the struggle is not mentioned here.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]</a> Furthermore, in Job 38, the Sea is not a chaotic force of evil defeated by God, but a powerful force which is <em>born</em> as God acts as midwife.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn7">[7]</a> Yahweh sets a boundary for the Sea, but he also gives its chaotic waters a place in the created order, revealing that his creation, though orderly, is not a perfectly safe or tame place for humans in its beauty and freedom.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The creation theology of the whirlwind speeches shows that “humanity has a place in God’s creation…not of dominion but of humility and of wonder.”<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn9">[9]</a>The inherent chaos and complexity of creation necessitate a humble reorientation in the priest-kings’ worship of their Creator. Nevertheless, although God’s temple is wild by design, Sin and Death continue to cut against the grain of Yahweh’s creative purposes, distorting even the intrinsic beauty of creation’s chaotic aspects. All is not as it should be in Elohim’s holy temple. Creation cries out for a Redeemer.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>In many conservative evangelical circles, biblical creation theology has been hijacked and eclipsed by the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology. Waltke summarizes the problem well: “Instead of metaphysical questions that shape culture, questions about dinosaurs, a young earth theory, and such dominate the evangelical landscape. This is unfortunate.”<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2">[2]</a> Nevertheless, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Scripture’s use of creation themes, whether the evangelical community gives them appropriate attention or not. Unfortunately, a comprehensive analysis of biblical creation theology, a field fertile enough to provide lifetimes of work and study, far exceeds the purview of this essay.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> However, a brief analysis of the motifs of creation as temple, chaos, and redemption will show that the overarching use of creation theology in Scripture is to bring about the praise of the Creator. Biblical creation theology, properly understood, leads to doxology.</p>
<h1 id="creation-as-gods-temple">CREATION AS GOD’S TEMPLE</h1>
<p>A fitting place to begin this study is the creation account of Gen 1:1-2:3, which depicts the cosmos as Elohim’s holy temple.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]</a> Although other ancient cosmogonies prominently feature a particular location or building as the nexus for worship of the respective deities, Gen 1 contains no such element. <a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]</a> Indeed, other creation accounts in the ANE associated the lack of a temple with the “precosmic condition.” That is, creation (the expression of divine authority) was not regarded as complete until the temple (the location for the implementation of divine authority) was constructed.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]</a> The cosmogony of Gen 1 thus seems strange when compared to its ANE counterparts, but this anomaly reveals the main emphasis of the passage: the entire universe is the sacred dwelling place of Elohim.</p>
<p>The structure of the narrative lends itself to this “cosmic temple” interpretation. In the first three days of creation (1:1-13), Elohim calls three “spheres” into being, relating to the main “functions” of life: light/darkness (time), water/sky (weather), and land/sea (food).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn7">[7]</a> He then proceeds to create in days four through six (1:14-31), assigning the “functionaries” of creation their respective roles and spheres.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn8">[8]</a> The scene is then set for the climax of the narrative, which is not the creation of humans, but the installation of the Sabbath (2:1-3).</p>
<p>If the connection between this Sabbath rest and creation as temple is not apparent to the modern reader, it is due to a lack of knowledge of where divine rest takes place.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn9">[9]</a> Upon reading that Elohim “rested” (Gen 2:2), the ancient reader would have immediately recognized that this was taking place in a divine <em>temple</em>, the exclusively-appropriate place for any god to rest and proceed to rule his domain from the throne.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn10">[10]</a> However, the English “rest” does not fully reflect the meaning of the Hebrew “שָׁבַּת, <em>shabbat,</em>” which refers to “the completion of certain activity with which one had been occupied.”<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn11">[11]</a> After completing the creative transition from non-functional chaotic waters to a stable and functional temple, Elohim “rests,” and the cosmos may now operate normally, with him in control.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn12">[12]</a> The clearest Scriptural compilation of all these ideas occurs in Isa 66:1-2a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what the Lord says:</p>
<p>“<em>The heavens are my throne</em> and <em>the earth is my footstool</em>. Where then is <em>the house</em> you will build for me? Where is <em>the place where I will</em> <em>rest</em>? My hand made them; that is how they came to be,” says the Lord.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doxologically, the creation of the universe as Elohim’s temple provides the impetus and parameters for appropriate worship of the Creator, whose “majestic splendor fills the entire earth” (Isa 6:3). As the only inhabitants of the cosmic temple created in the image (צֶ֫לֶם, <em>tselem</em>) of Elohim, humans were created to function as “priest-kings”, extending his rule and dominion throughout the entire sacred realm of creation (Gen 1:26-28).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn14">[14]</a> Through the lens of creation as temple, therefore, worship is relational, designed to be mediated by Elohim’s beloved priest-kings as they live in perfect relationship with him, with each other, and with the rest of creation, a full vision of the divine rest appropriate to Elohim’s cosmic temple.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>However, there is a tension between creation as it is now experienced and as it has just been described.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn16">[16]</a> Genesis 3 gives the tragic explanation: Sin and Death, God’s cosmic enemies, have infected and affected every layer of the cosmic temple,<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn17">[17]</a> pulling the universe backwards, so to speak, toward the chaotic watery depths from which it was called into being. If the temple is no longer “safe,” is appropriate worship still possible?</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The following is an expanded version of the speech I gave at this year’s CU Scholar Dessert Reception.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I ever decided about Cedarville University was that I would not, under any circumstances, attend. Since my administrator’s son, Drew Flamm, worked in admissions at CU, I had been inundated since before I could remember with calls to become a yellow-jacket, and out of sheer stubbornness of heart, I refused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(The following is an expanded version of the speech I gave at this year’s CU Scholar Dessert Reception.)</em></p>
<p>The first thing I ever decided about Cedarville University was that I would not, under any circumstances, attend. Since my administrator’s son, Drew Flamm, worked in admissions at CU, I had been inundated since before I could remember with calls to become a yellow-jacket, and out of sheer stubbornness of heart, I refused.</p>
<p>Almost seven years later, and I stand before you all with the hopes of graduating next May. What changed? Well, for starters, God’s grace was, well, irresistible for even a stubborn high school student named Joshua Steele. While I don’t have time now to recount all the details, suffice it to say that receiving this scholarship was the final capstone of a tumultuous and miraculous college search process. I offer my sincerest thanks to the members of the selection committee. I stand before you now on nothing but a mountain of God’s grace, of which your generosity has been no small portion.</p>
<p>As I near the end of my Cedarville experience, two things have made my journey thus far particularly unforgettable and life-changing:</p>
<p>Firstly, at Cedarville I met and fell in love with my wife, Rachel. That’s right, we met in Up-Chucks the first time my freshman unit got the chance to meet our Printy sisters. It wasn’t love at first sight, but it was love pretty darn quick. Together we’ve been Getting Started Leaders, served as brother/sister RAs, worked together at summer camp, completed a marathon… and now we’re lifelong partners in the pursuit of God’s grace and shalom. I don’t care if this sounds trite to some, falling in love with my girlfriend, fiancée, and now wife has been the most rewarding-yet-challenging aspect of my time here at Cedarville. I can’t wait to see how God uses us for his kingdom in the future.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying that everyone in here has to find a husband or wife and get married during their time here at Cedarville. Furthermore, and this is especially for the underclassmen, I hope that your Cedarville experience is somehow better than mine. But could I encourage you all to do the second thing that’s made my Cedarville experience unforgettable?</p>
<p>At Cedarville I fell in love with the Gospel and learned how big God’s redemptive mission is. I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Preseminary Bible because, by God’s grace at the time I finished high school, I was sick of pretending like the Gospel was a shallow flow-chart or bullet-pointed list that could be pulled off the shelf and employed in a five-minute conversation in order to “make a new Christian.”</p>
<p>I knew that something was wrong, and I wanted to devote my years at Cedarville to learning more about the Gospel in order someday to be better able to preach that good news to others. While I’ve only just begun to scratch the surface, I have learned a few important things during my time here, things that have made the Gospel all the more precious to me.</p>
<p>And I owe many of these lessons to the godly professors who have poured into my life, (directly or indirectly), whose vision for God’s redemptive mission I have been privileged to “catch.” People like TC Ham, John White, Carl Smith, Jeff Cook, David Mills, Chris Miller, Dan Estes, Joel Williams, Tim Gombis, and Michael Pahl.</p>
<p><strong>See it’s frighteningly easy to slice and dice the <em>missio Dei</em>, the mission of God, into dilapidated pieces. We want the moralistic “holiness” slice, the private piety chunk, the ticket to escape from hell-fire, the perfect precision in doctrinal orthodoxy, and the list goes on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>None of these are bad things, but when we act as if they’re the main thing, we fragment the Gospel, which fragments the Church, and we’re left with nothing but a shadow of the gloriously good news that, in Christ, God is reconciling the world to himself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That is, God is “heading-up” all things, things on heaven and things on earth,</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the Jews and the Gentiles</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the rich and the poor</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the Regular Baptists and the Southern Baptists</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the Presbyterians and the Catholics</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the angry fundamentalists and the crazy liberals</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the black and the white</strong></p>
<p><strong>…the “have”s and the “have-not”s</strong></p>
<p><strong>…”us” and “them”</strong></p>
<p><strong>ALL THINGS, THINGS ON HEAVEN AND THINGS ON EARTH,</strong></p>
<p><strong>in His Son, who has defeated Sin and Death, and whom we proclaim as King, Messiah, Savior, and Lord over the entire universe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These truths can unify us, as Jesus prayed for in John 17. They can radically change the way we see God, other human beings, the universe around us, and even the way we see ourselves.</strong></p>
<p>But they can also alter the life of the son of a bricklayer and a homemaker from Toledo, OH, who has no other reason for his unforgettable Cedarville experience than the sheer grace of God alone.</p>

      <title>Wedding Vows: My Personal Take on the Traditional Version</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-traditional-wedding-vows&#34;&gt;The Traditional Wedding Vows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn’t know, the “traditional” wedding vows – in English, at least – are found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bcponline.org/&#34;&gt;Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/baskerville.htm&#34;&gt;1662 Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, the marriage vows read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love and to cheriſh, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-traditional-wedding-vows">The Traditional Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>In case you didn’t know, the “traditional” wedding vows – in English, at least – are found in the <a href="http://www.bcponline.org/">Book of Common Prayer</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1662/baskerville.htm">1662 Book of Common Prayer</a>, the marriage vows read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold,</strong><br>
<strong>from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love and to cheriſh, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I N. take thee M. to my wedded huſband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love, cheriſh, and to obey, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we got married in August 2012, my wife, Rachel, and I decided to write our own vows, at least loosely based upon the traditional vows. (Give us a break, we weren’t yet Anglicans!)</p>
<p>So, here are the vows I wrote, and still endeavor to keep as Rachel’s husband!</p>
<h1 id="my-wedding-vows">My Wedding Vows</h1>
<p>I, Joshua Patrick Steele, pledge myself to you, Rachel Elizabeth, as your husband.</p>
<p>I solemnly vow:</p>
<p>to love you as I have been loved by Love himself,</p>
<p>to take joy daily in your beauty and worth as God’s precious daughter,</p>
<p>to cling to you faithfully with mind, soul, and body,</p>
<p>in light and in darkness,</p>
<p>in summer and in winter,</p>
<p>in springtime and in harvest,</p>
<p>in plenty and in famine,</p>
<p>through Sheol to Eden,</p>
<p>in sickly decay and in healthy vigor,</p>
<p>in unspeakable joy and in bitter sorrow,</p>
<p>in the tempests of chaos and in the calms of perfect peace.</p>
<p>And, by your side, to pursue relentlessly God’s grace and shalom</p>
<p>until Death parts us</p>
<p>or Death itself is vanquished by our coming King,</p>
<p>in whose presence I hereto pledge you my faithfulness.</p>

      <title>The Book of Romans, Distilled and Paraphrased</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/romans-distilled-paraphrased/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2012 14:02:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/romans-distilled-paraphrased/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;romans-11-17&#34;&gt;Romans 1:1-17&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t catch anything else from what I’m about to say, remember this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is righteous. He is just. He is faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has proven himself faithful to his promises of restoring the world, working through his faithful Son, the Messiah, to bring about both our faith in and our faithfulness to him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.</em></p>
<h1 id="romans-11-17">Romans 1:1-17</h1>
<p>If you don’t catch anything else from what I’m about to say, remember this:</p>
<p>God is righteous. He is just. He is faithful.</p>
<p>God has proven himself faithful to his promises of restoring the world, working through his faithful Son, the Messiah, to bring about both our faith in and our faithfulness to him.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain this further.</p>
<p>But first, the objections:</p>
<h1 id="romans-118-32">Romans 1:18-32</h1>
<p>See, at first glance, the big idea above seems ridiculous. God is faithful? Have you seen the world recently? It’s corrupt to the core. Idolatry, sexual immorality, violence, deception, hostility, etc. Because people refused to believe that God is who he says he is, Sin and Death have infected and affected every layer of human existence. If God is truly righteous, why is his world so unrighteous?</p>
<p>(For a theological essay about what the Bible is and why it’s important, read <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/on-scripture/">this piece.</a>)</p>
<h1 id="romans-21-29">Romans 2:1-29</h1>
<p>Furthermore, look at his “chosen people,” the Jews! They are no better than anyone else, despite their privileged position as the ones through whom God promised to work.</p>
<p>They have failed to understand that their identity as God’s people was more inward than outward, and by boasting about their possession of God’s law (instead of allowing God to change them from the inside out), they have become just as unrepentant and stubborn as the rest of the world!</p>
<h1 id="romans-31-8">Romans 3:1-8</h1>
<p>Doesn’t Israel’s utter failure to have faith in God and fulfill their role as a conduit of God’s grace to the entire world mean that God’s plan and promises have failed?</p>
<p>No. Just because some of the Jews failed does not mean all of them have.</p>
<p>And it especially does not mean that God has.</p>
<p>He is still faithful and righteous. But more on that later…</p>
<h1 id="romans-39-20">Romans 3:9-20</h1>
<p>Even though everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, is corrupt…</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Sin and Death, God’s cosmic enemies, have polluted his creation…</p>
<p>Although Scripture itself testifies that we are all unfaithful…</p>
<p>Although the Law which was supposed to guide us in our pursuit of God has only highlighted just how broken we are and how far we have fallen…</p>
<h1 id="romans-321-31">Romans 3:21-31</h1>
<p>Despite all of these things, God is righteous.</p>
<p>God has revealed his covenant faithfulness to us through Jesus the Messiah, the True and Faithful Israelite through whom God has kept his redemptive promises. Through his death, the Messiah has absorbed the wrath of God which our unfaithfulness merited. What’s more, he has reconciled us to God and made possible the truly human life, one which honors God by living in perfect relationship with him and the rest of his creation. Through the Messiah, God is proving his faithfulness in redeeming the entire world.</p>
<h1 id="romans-41-25">Romans 4:1-25</h1>
<p>However, you’ll notice I said “made possible” above. This is because the benefits of what the Messiah has done are only appropriated to us, as they always have been, through faith. The unrepentant Jews made the mistake of assuming that their cultural identity of Torah-obedience was the source of their identity as God’s people. Not so! Look at Abraham! The righteousness of God was appropriated to him because of his faith. After all, he wasn’t even circumcised yet! Therefore, just as Abraham, we all receive the benefits of and incorporation into God’s redemptive mission through faith, and not through the Law. The key is putting our faith in the faithful Messiah.</p>
<h1 id="romans-51-21">Romans 5:1-21</h1>
<p>Pardon me, but this topic is so important that I’m going to run with it for awhile!</p>
<p>See, this combination of the Messiah’s faithfulness and our faith in him means that God has declared us faithful (righteous). Did you hear that? Not only is God faithful, but despite our unfaithfulness, he declares us faithful as well because of his faithful Son and our faith in him!</p>
<p>This means that we now have PEACE (and not enmity) with God!</p>
<p>This is possible because, get this, at every point at which our father Adam (and everyone ever since) failed, the Messiah has perfectly succeeded!</p>
<p>Before placing our faith in the Messiah’s faithfulness, we were all “in Adam.” That is, we were at enmity with God because of our unfaithfulness to him which deserved condemnation. However, the Messiah’s faithful obedience didn’t just undo our unrighteousness, putting us back on level ground. Instead, it has taken us to the soaring heights of God’s own righteousness! We are now “in the Messiah”!</p>
<h1 id="romans-61-25">Romans 6:1-25</h1>
<p>But that’s not the only transfer that’s happened! Being moved from “in Adam” to “in the Messiah” also means that we’ve been moved from the Death which Sin brings to the Life which the Messiah offers to us! While we were “in Adam,” we were slaves to Sin and Death, dominated by them and without freedom. However, now that we are “in the Messiah,” we have choices! Free choices! Sin still brings death, but we have been set free and we have the ability and opportunity to make proper choices and live life to its fullest by being truly human, giving glory to our gracious Creator!</p>
<h1 id="romans-71-6">Romans 7:1-6</h1>
<p>All of this has radically changed our relationship to God’s Law. Through the transfer from Adam to Messiah, from Death to Life, we have been set free from the Law’s condemnation! We can now live a life where God’s Spirit writes the Law on our hearts!</p>
<h1 id="romans-77-25">Romans 7:7-25</h1>
<p>See, beforehand, while we were still “in Adam,” the Law didn’t really help us out. Because of our initial unfaithfulness, the Law highlighted our brokenness and need for a Messiah Savior. It condemned us in the sight of a holy God. Although there was nothing wrong with the Law itself, there was something profoundly wrong with us, and the Law was very good at showing that!</p>
<h1 id="romans-81-30">Romans 8:1-30</h1>
<p>But our faith in Jesus the faithful Messiah changes things. As I mentioned above, we have now been set free from the Law’s old condemnation! The Spirit of God writes God’s law on our very heart. Not only that, the Spirit also gives us the power to live a life which is pleasing to God, in right relationship with our Creator and all of his creation. The Spirit is both our GPS and our engine. Therefore, we no longer have to worry about being condemned by the Law, because the Spirit guides and enables us to fulfill the Law’s requirements as those who are “in the Messiah.”</p>
<h1 id="romans-831-39">Romans 8:31-39</h1>
<p>Take a moment to think about all I have said so far. Despite the unfaithfulness of all humanity, God has proven himself faithful, most notably through his faithful Son, the Messiah. Look at all God has done for us and given to us through the Messiah! Consider the depths of his love for us! Nothing can separate us from the love of God and the love of our Messiah! God is indeed righteous. Although the plan has not yet been fully accomplished, he is well on his way toward redeeming all that he has made.</p>
<p>However, we still haven’t covered everything. If you’ll remember, there’s still that tricky bit about the failure of God’s chosen people. Even though God has done all of this for us through the Messiah, doesn’t the failure of Israel damage his righteousness?</p>
<p>Can God still be fully faithful if it appears his specific promises to/about Israel have failed?</p>
<p>Despite the apparent failure of Israel, God is still righteous and faithful!</p>
<p>Consider three reasons why:</p>
<h1 id="romans-91-29">Romans 9:1-29</h1>
<p>Firstly, if you will remember, God never promised to use every single ethnic Jew as one of his chosen people. Consider Abraham’s descendants, they were numbered through Isaac and not Ishmael. Similarly, Isaac’s descendants were numbered through Jacob and not Esau. This does not mean that God is unfair, for he is not obligated to show mercy to anyone! It also does not mean that God was eternally unloving to those he did not choose at specific times to work through in Israel’s history toward the coming of the Messiah! The main point isn’t that Ishmael and Esau were damned to hell. It’s that God has never promised to choose and use every single ethnic descendant of Abraham. It is therefore unfair to act as if God has promised to always use all physical Jews. As I alluded to before, the *true* Jews have always been so inwardly, not just outwardly.</p>
<h1 id="romans-930-1021">Romans 9:30-10:21</h1>
<p>Secondly, let’s not blame God for what the Israelites themselves failed to do! Just because many (but not all!) Israelites have failed to have faith throughout the years does NOT mean that God is no longer faithful. Although God never promised to choose and use every ethnic Jew as one of his chosen people, all Jews did have more than enough opportunities to place their faith in God and live in faithfulness to him! However, as mentioned toward the beginning, they failed to realize the key role that faith played in the process. They boasted in their ethnic/national identity of Torah-following instead of boasting in the faithfulness of their God and fulfilling their priestly duties to the world. Please do not blame this failure on God. He has remained faithful and gracious.</p>
<h1 id="romans-111-36">Romans 11:1-36</h1>
<p>Thirdly, and finally, the story is not yet over! The failure/rejection of Israel is neither total nor permanent. God has always preserved a faithful remnant. That is, there has always existed, within ethnic Israel, the true Israel, the faithful people of God. Despite Israel’s failures, there has always been a remnant, graciously preserved by God to accomplish his purposes. But this remnant will not always be partial! There will come a day in the future when God will do through Israel abundantly above and beyond what he has ever done before. A complete, full generation of Israelites will someday be rescued and used by God to bless the world, completely dispelling any notions that God has somehow failed his people. Despite Israel’s faithlessness, God has remained, and will always remain, faithful and righteous.</p>
<p>This is more than even I can comprehend!</p>
<p>Praise be to God!</p>
<h1 id="romans-12">Romans 12</h1>
<p>In view of God’s righteousness, his faithfulness in redeeming the world and putting it back together again through his faithful Son, the Messiah, let’s consider what it looks like to join him in his redemptive mission! If you’ll remember, our faith in the faithfulness of the Messiah is designed to bring about our own faithfulness as well!</p>
<p>What does this faithfulness look like, in response to all God has done?</p>
<p>It starts with a refusal to conform to the world’s ways of life. Remember my mentioning of the consequences of Sin and Death earlier? Well, in addition to those things, you must also refuse to be conformed to the ways of pride and division. Instead of conformity, pursue transformation. Allow the Spirit of God to renew your mind, and it will revolutionize your relationships. Pursue things like unity, genuine love, harmony, and peace. In all circumstances, even when you are being persecuted, refuse to be overcome by evil. Instead, overcome evil with good.</p>
<h1 id="romans-13">Romans 13</h1>
<p>This all more-or-less makes sense when applied to fellow believers and neighbors, but when we start talking about persecutors and the government, things get tricky!</p>
<p>The crucial thing to remember is that, although God is in the process of invading this fallen world to establish his righteous kingdom, this does NOT mean that you should go violently overthrowing the Roman Empire, or any other empire for that matter! This is because the King we follow stands for, as I’ve just mentioned, genuine love, harmony, and peace. This rules-out violent rebellion and vengeful retaliation.</p>
<p>I’m NOT arguing, by any means, that you should mindlessly participate in the currents of society and government which go against God’s kingdom. Stay alert and faithfully follow the Messiah!</p>
<p>However, instead of trying to overthrow the Empire, you should reasonably and respectfully participate in society. Trust God’s sovereignty over human affairs by submitting to the authorities and paying your taxes. God’s kingdom will be established from the inside out!</p>
<p>These things are all related. The same characteristics of your love for each other and for your neighbors should be applied to persecutors and the governing authorities. If “in Adam,” then this stuff sounds ridiculous. However, we are “in the Messiah,” and this radically changes everything. Let us live in LOVE, the fulfillment of God’s law, as we await our Messiah’s return…</p>
<h1 id="romans-14-15">Romans 14-15</h1>
<p>…which brings me to the most pressing issue I wish to address.</p>
<p>See, all of this means very little if it does not impact how you Jews and Gentiles relate to each other within the body of the Messiah, the Church. Now that you are both accepted as full members of God’s holy people, I realize that there has been quite a bit of social tension created, specifically with regards to food! While I could give you an apostolically-prescribed menu, that would defeat the purpose, because my main goal (and God’s main goal, for that matter) in this is to see you unified, harmoniously working together as Jews and Gentiles for God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Here’s why this is important. If you allow something as simple and amoral as food to fragment you, think of what a slap in the face that is to the Messiah, who moved heaven and earth to defeat Sin and Death and reconcile you all to God.</p>
<p>Sin and Death destroy relationships.</p>
<p>Our Messiah destroyed Sin and Death.</p>
<p>If you, then, go back and destroy relationships over things such as food, you are effectively undoing the work of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Do not let this be so! Overwhelm each other with grace and love as you pursue unity!</p>
<p>Use these principles within the body to settle all further and future differences as well, for your unity and love for one another prove that God’s mission is working in the world!</p>
<h1 id="romans-16">Romans 16</h1>
<p>I am confident that God has been and will continue to be at work in your lives. Deeply consider the things I have said to you. But take heart, for we serve a God who loves human beings, and that is why he has chosen to use us in his redemptive mission!</p>
<p>Just don’t forfeit this precious role by allowing people to cause dissensions among you!</p>
<p>I have now come full circle in my argument.</p>
<p>Despite our failures, God is righteous in his mission of redeeming the world through his Son, the Messiah, and through his people, the Church, of which you are a part.</p>
<p>His faithfulness to us through the Messiah is designed to bring about (through our faith in him) our own faithfulness and obedience to him.</p>
<p>May our righteous God and our faithful Messiah be praised and given glory forever!</p>
<p>Amen!</p>

      <title>Unity?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/unity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2012 19:22:24 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I’ve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The more I study the New Testament, I become more convinced that the unity of the Church is of utmost importance to God.</p>
<p>What bothers me is that this has never been taught to me before. All of the things I’ve learned (specifically in my studies on Philippians, Galatians, and now Romans) about the importance of unity for the sake of the Gospel mission and the Kingdom of God have come as somewhat of a shock.</p>
<p>It’s not that I’ve never heard about the importance of unity before. But when the topic has been addressed in the past, it’s amounted to little more than being nice to my friends…people who are already likely to be remarkably similar to me, people already within the little camp of Christianity in which I have grown-up.</p>
<p>But it’s never been encouraged to spread to other Christian “camps.” Forget the Pentecostals, Anglicans, Methodists, Catholics, Presbyterians, etc. If the pastor’s feeling a bit edgy, we can partner with them on service projects, but unless the “others” get their act together, they are to be tolerated at best, and at worst ridiculed.</p>
<p>Instead, in my particular stream of Christianity, the focus has been placed on two things: <strong>doctrinal orthodoxy</strong> and <strong>moral purity</strong>.</p>
<p>Please don’t hear me wrongly, I am not denying the importance of either of these two things. God is meant to be known well, and to do that we must think, talk, teach, and speak about him well. Theology is not to be a shoddy enterprise, and we must constantly examine ourselves, aware of the shortcomings of our humanness, in the pursuit of understanding of Yahweh. Furthermore, Yahweh is a holy God. He hates Sin and Death, and if we are serious about following him, we must hate Sin and Death as well.</p>
<p>Christ calls us to live Genesis 1-2 lives in a Genesis 3 world.</p>
<p>But, wait a second. Go back and read that again. “Christ calls us to live Genesis 1-2 lives in a Genesis 3 world.” What popped into your head as you read that sentence? What should characterize that Genesis 1-2 kind of life?</p>
<p>I fear that, if you’ve inherited the same stream of Christianity that I have, <strong>unity</strong> and <strong>interpersonal relationships</strong> were not the first things to color your vision of what Genesis 1-2 would look like today. Instead, we (conservative evangelical North American Christians) are much more likely to think of living a morally spotless life driven by a flawless theology. With no sin to fetter us and lead us toward doctrinal laxity, we would be free to enjoy God forever.</p>
<p>We have flattened Christianity by focusing on these things at the expense of focusing on the rich vision of community and unity that we find in the pages of Scripture. Read Genesis 1-2. We were created to enjoy God, yes. We were created to live without sin, yes. But we were created to enjoy and be enjoyed by each other. We were made to know and be known. God’s perfect shalom included much more than moral purity and doctrinal orthodoxy. It included perfect <strong>relationships</strong>: with God, with each other, with our own “self”s, and with all of creation.</p>
<p>And likewise, the Fall of Genesis 3 broke relationships. It separated us from God, estranged us from each other, introduced discord within our own psyches, and infected the creation in which we dwell. Sin and Death were unleashed into the cosmos, and they have polluted and twisted every layer.</p>
<p>The call back to Genesis 1-2 therefore involves much more than right doctrine and moral purity. God is in the process of redeeming everything. And every time we cut his redemptive mission in half (or sometimes smaller), we do so at our own peril.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…toward the administration of the fullness of the times, to head up<sup> </sup><em><strong>all things</strong></em> in Christ – the things in *heaven<sup> </sup>*and the things on <em>earth.</em> (Ephesians 1:10 NET)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that God’s heart breaks over the lack of unity in his Church today. Is he pleased with the individual moral sins we love to emphasize? By no means. Is he pleased with bad theology? No way. But something is seriously amiss if we do not think that God’s heart breaks over the fragmentation within the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>What do you think about this issue? Why does this not bother us like it should? And most importantly, what can we do to address this problem?</p>
<p>Grace and peace,</p>
<p>~Josh</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031049298X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=faithinirelan-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399373&amp;amp;creativeASIN=031049298X&#34;&gt;The King Jesus Gospel: The Original Good News Revisited&lt;/a&gt; by Scot McKnight, who makes the claim that the gospel is the saving story of Jesus as Messiah, King, and Lord as the completion to the story of Israel, I started to notice some profound gospel messages in the Christmas carols we often sing during this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found that several of these carols go much deeper (much more biblical) than the personal salvation “gospel” of sin-management that we often preach and sing about. What’s tragic is that, even though these carols are quite possibly the best-known Christian songs, their familiarity (and the fact that we only break them out for 1/12th of the year), makes it quite easy to ignore their substance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><strong>Christians, my brothers and sisters,</strong></p>
<p><strong>instead of allowing Fox News to persuade us that the “War on Christmas” is being fought in the stores when people say “Happy Holidays,”</strong></p>
<p><strong>instead of thinking that our Messiah’s main “sorrow” in December is that more people are not saying “Merry Christmas” more often…</strong></p>
<p><strong>…let us examine ourselves. How guilty are we of reducing our “King,” “everlasting Lord,” “Prince of Peace,” “Sun of Righteousness,” and our Messiah into an individual savior whose birth, life, death, and resurrection accomplishes nothing more than getting us into heaven when we die and helping us to manage our personal sins in the meantime?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Perhaps we should be more concerned with our emaciated versions of the gospel than with how we are greeted when entering and exiting our society’s temples to consumerism and greed.</strong></p>
<p>Please join me in attempting to look through the unfortunately and undeservedly trite familiarity of this song to see its portrayal of the gospel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hark! The herald angels sing,</strong><br>
<strong>“Glory to the newborn King;</strong><br>
<strong>Peace on earth, and mercy mild,</strong><br>
<strong>God and sinners reconciled!”</strong><br>
<strong>Joyful, all ye nations rise,</strong><br>
<strong>Join the triumph of the skies;</strong><br>
<strong>With th’angelic host proclaim,</strong><br>
<strong>“Christ is born in Bethlehem!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hark! the herald angels sing,</strong><br>
<strong>“Glory to the newborn King!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Christ, by highest Heav’n adored;</strong><br>
<strong>Christ the everlasting Lord;</strong><br>
<strong>Late in time, behold Him come,</strong><br>
<strong>Offspring of a virgin’s womb.</strong><br>
<strong>Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;</strong><br>
<strong>Hail th’incarnate Deity,</strong><br>
<strong>Pleased with us in flesh to dwell,</strong><br>
<strong>Jesus our Emmanuel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hail the heav’nly Prince of Peace!</strong><br>
<strong>Hail the Sun of Righteousness!</strong><br>
<strong>Light and life to all He brings,</strong><br>
<strong>Ris’n with healing in His wings.</strong><br>
<strong>Mild He lays His glory by,</strong><br>
<strong>Born that man no more may die.</strong><br>
<strong>Born to raise the sons of earth,</strong><br>
<strong>Born to give them second birth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Come, Desire of nations, come,</strong><br>
<strong>Fix in us Thy humble home;</strong><br>
<strong>Rise, the woman’s conqu’ring Seed,</strong><br>
<strong>Bruise in us the serpent’s head.</strong><br>
<strong>Now display Thy saving power,</strong><br>
<strong>Ruined nature now restore;</strong><br>
<strong>Now in mystic union join</strong><br>
<strong>Thine to ours, and ours to Thine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface,</strong><br>
<strong>Stamp Thine image in its place:</strong><br>
<strong>Second Adam from above,</strong><br>
<strong>Reinstate us in Thy love.</strong><br>
<strong>Let us Thee, though lost, regain,</strong><br>
<strong>Thee, the Life, the inner man:</strong><br>
<strong>O, to all Thyself impart,</strong><br>
<strong>Formed in each believing heart.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May your hearts and minds be set upon Jesus the Messiah, King, Lord, Savior, and Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>And may you all, in doing so, have a very Merry Christmas.</p>

      <title>Church and State</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/church_and_state/</link>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.com/church_and_state/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Note: for a more recent piece on the relationship between Church and State, see my essay: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/2015/12/08/improvising-church-state/&#34;&gt;Improvising Church and State&lt;/a&gt;.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read an article by Kevin DeYoung at The Gospel Coalition: &lt;a href=&#34;http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/05/26/thinking-theologically-about-memorial-day/?comments#comments&#34;&gt;“Thinking Theologically About Memorial Day”&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to his intro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post probably has something to make everyone unhappy. But here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Memorial Day on Monday (in the U.S.) and, no doubt, a number of patriotic services scheduled for this Sunday, I want to offer a few theses on patriotism and the church. Each of these points could be substantially expanded and beg more detailed defense and explanation, but since this is a blog and not a term paper, I’ll try to keep this under 1500 words.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I just read an article by Kevin DeYoung at The Gospel Coalition: <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2011/05/26/thinking-theologically-about-memorial-day/?comments#comments">“Thinking Theologically About Memorial Day”</a>. Listen to his intro:</p>

Each of these points could be substantially expanded and beg more detailed defense and explanation, but since this is a blog and not a term paper, I’ll try to keep this under 1500 words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DeYoung goes on to cover five main points:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Being a Christian does not remove national and ethnic identities.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Patriotism, like other earthly “prides,” can be a virtue or vice.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Allegiance to God and allegiance to your country are not inherently incompatible.</strong></li>
<li><strong>God’s people are not tied to any one nation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All this leads to one final point: while patriotism can be good, the church is not a good place for patriotism.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I really appreciate this attempt to arrive at a balance between those who simply baptize their American patriotism and call it Christianity and those who view every instance of patriotism as damnable idolatry. I loved DeYoung’s last paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some parts of the church, every hint of patriotism makes you a jingoistic idolater. You are allowed to love every country except your own. But in other parts of the church, true religion blends too comfortably into civil religion. You are allowed to worship in our services as long as you love America as much as we do. I don’t claim to have arrived at the golden mean, but I imagine many churches could stand to think more carefully about their theology of God and country. Churches should be glad to have their members celebrate Memorial Day with gusto this Monday. We should be less sanguine about celebrating it with pomp and circumstance on Sunday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, while I want to avoid the extreme position of viewing every form of patriotism as idolatry, I think that American Christians too often give unthinking allegiance and support to the country in which we live. Without demonizing the country in which we live, the amazing freedoms which we are able to enjoy, and the men and women who have sacrificed to secure and preserve those freedoms for us, we need to always remember that we, if we belong to Christ, are ultimately citizens of a greater Kingdom than the United States of America. DeYoung has this to say about the compatibility of allegiance to God and allegiance to one’s country:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you read all that the New Testament says about governing authorities in places like Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2, you see that the normal situation is one of compatible loyalties. The church is not the state and the state is not God, but this does not mean the church must always be against the state. In general, then, it’s possible to be a good Christian and a good American, or a good Ghanaian or a good Korean. Patriotism is not bad. Singing your national anthem and getting choked up is not bad. Allegiance to God and allegiance to your country do not have to be at odds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct, allegiance to God and allegiance to country do not have to be diametrically opposed. Christians should live as respectful citizens of their respective nations. However, do we <strong>really</strong> believe that Ghanaian and Korean Christians are every bit as good as American ones? I know everyone’s going to say “yes,” but do we <em><strong>really</strong></em> believe this? What if those Ghanaian and/or Korean Christians don’t like the United States of America? Are they still as pleasing to God in our eyes, or does their righteousness depend on their support of the Red, White, and Blue? Because a lot of what I have seen/heard/experienced in the American church seems to subtly teach that our country is the best and most deserving of God’s favor. I retweeted the following recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m waiting for the Iranian and N. Korean editions of the Patriot’s Bible. <a href="http://www.americanpatriotsbible.com/">http://www.americanpatriotsbible.com</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does something like this have the potential to upset so many American Christians? “Iran and North Korea are clearly more morally evil than the United States,” some will say. Maybe so, but since when does our country get to claim the right of being God-approved? Can Christians in Ghana sing “God bless Ghana”? Perhaps our reactions to tweets/messages/statements like the one above only prove the problem.</p>
<p>Before someone calls me a heretic or an anti-American, please know that simply questioning the American church’s commitment to the USA does NOT immediately make me into someone who burns flags and pickets soldiers funerals. That would be swinging to the other end of the spectrum, and I do not believe that such a dichotomy exists. If someone does not give unquestioning allegiance to the USA, it does not mean that they automatically align themselves with the crazies over at Westboro Baptist Church.</p>
<p>I am a <strong>Christian</strong>.</p>
<p>I am also an American citizen. I obey the law, salute the flag, am respectful of the men and women in the armed forces, grateful for their sacrifices, and thankful for the fact that I live in a country where I can enjoy unparalleled freedoms (such as writing blog posts like this without having to fear for my life).</p>
<p>…but I do <em><strong>not</strong></em> give my ultimate allegiance to the American flag, or any other national standard for that matter. I pledge my ultimate allegiance to Jesus the Messiah. And while most Christians in the United States of America would nod their heads and agree with that previous statement, I think that we all need to consider whether we are living it out or not. Will our church services on Memorial Day reflect this?</p>
<p>May our eternal and infinite God bless his <em>global</em> bride, his <em>global</em> people, his <strong><em>global</em> Church</strong> as Christians from every tribe, tongue, nation, and language follow their true King, Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<p>~Josh.</p>

      <title>What the Bible Says About Poverty: The Book of Proverbs</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.com/bible-poverty-proverbs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction-poverty-and-wealth&#34;&gt;Introduction: Poverty and Wealth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction-poverty-and-wealth">Introduction: Poverty and Wealth</h1>
<p>In contrast to the affluence of mainstream American culture, poverty is a harsh and painful reality. It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.</p>
<p>Modern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.</p>
<p>However, one can effortlessly go through daily life in middle class America without giving much thought or care to the billions of people living in poverty worldwide. Furthermore, one can even profess faith in Jesus Christ and regularly attend an average evangelical church in the United States without being prompted to pay the poor, underprivileged, and oppressed of this world any mind.</p>
<p>In this milieu of wealth and poverty existing side by side in an atmosphere of confusion and apathy, the book of Proverbs provides relevant insights into the nature of poverty, the nature of Yahweh, and how his people should respond to it.</p>
<p>(For more on how Christians should think about poverty and wealth, see my essay <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/christians-and-wealth/">“Christians and Wealth.”</a>)</p>
<h2 id="descriptions-of-poverty-effects-and-causes">Descriptions of Poverty: Effects and Causes</h2>
<p>Many proverbs are devoted to describing the harsh realities of poverty, showing that the Hebrew sages were well aware of its existence and characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>
<p>These proverbs frequently describe the poor in direct contrast to the wealthy. Consider Proverbs 10:15:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A rich man’s wealth is in his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The force of the antithetical parallelism of this verse is hard to overlook. Whybray explains that the main point “is that wealth protects the rich from the vicissitudes of life, while the poor, having no resources to fall back on, are easily vulnerable to total disaster” (1994, 165).</p>
<p>The word used for “poor” here is <em><strong>dal</strong>.</em> While Whybray states that this word is synonymous with the other Hebrew terms for “poor” (<em>˓ānı̂, ˒ebyôn,</em> and <em>rāš</em>)in Proverbs (1994, 165), <em>The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament</em> (TWOT) differentiates <em>dal</em> from the other three, saying that “unlike <em>˓ānı̂</em>, <em>dal</em> does not emphasize pain or oppression; unlike <em>˒ebyôn</em>, it does not primarily emphasize need, and unlike <em>rāš</em>, it represents those who lack rather than the destitute.” <em>Dal</em> refers to <strong>the lack of both material and social resources</strong> (Harris, et al. 1999).</p>
<p>This lack of social resources can be seen in the proverbs that describe how poverty affects relationships. Proverbs 14:20 says that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The poor is disliked even by his neighbor, but the rich has many friends.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This same theme is reiterated in chapter 19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wealth brings many new friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend” (19:4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expanded across two verses, it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Many seek the favor of a generous man, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. All a poor man’s brothers hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him!” (19:6-7a).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These three proverbs contrast the social standings of the wealthy and the impoverished. Alden’s comment on 14:20 is apt when he says that “the unfortunate truth [is] that greed is a more compelling trait than generosity; people are more eager to have rich friends than poor ones” (1983, 114).</p>
<p>Proverbs 19:6-7a expands upon this, describing how people are naturally drawn to relationships that give them material benefit. It is rare, however, to find people who are drawn to relationships that would cost them materially. Even a poor man’s family members “hate him”!</p>
<p>Bridges says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As the winter brooks, filled from the opening springs and the torrents from heaven, are dried up and vanish before the summer heat; so these friends of the poor go far from him, cold, distant, and vanishing in the day of his calamity” (1987, cf. 1846, 312).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Materially and socially, poverty wreaks havoc on the lives of those it entraps.</p>
<h3 id="causes">Causes</h3>
<p>Given the terrible effects and characteristics of poverty, Proverbs naturally contains many admonitions to avoid its causes.</p>
<p>Causes of poverty listed in Proverbs include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>a “slack hand” (laziness) (10:4),</li>
<li>ignorance of instruction (13:18),</li>
<li>endless talk (without toil/labor) (14:23),</li>
<li>hastiness (21:15),</li>
<li>the love of pleasure (21:17),</li>
<li>drunkenness and gluttony (23:21),</li>
<li>worthless pursuits (28:19),</li>
<li>and stinginess (28:22).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of particular interest is the repetition of the warning against excessive slumber if one is to avoid poverty (6:10-11; 20:13; 23:21; 24:33-34).</p>
<p>Proverbs 6:10-11 and 24:33-34 include the almost verbatim admonition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleep (as compared with labor) might give the initial benefits of rest and relaxation, but when developed into an excessive habit, it can have disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>John Chrysostom comments upon 6:11:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is work at first difficult? Then look to its results. Is idleness sweet? Then consider what comes out of it in the end. So let us look not at the beginning of things, but let us also see where they end up” (Wright 2005, 50).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach perhaps summarizes most of the practical warnings in Proverbs about avoiding poverty. <strong>What initially seems like the easiest and most comfortable choice will rarely, if ever, lead to success.</strong></p>
<p>Set apart from the practical warnings of avoiding poverty, however, is Proverbs 22:16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verb “oppress” here is the term <em>˓ā∙šǎq</em>, meaning “mistreat, i.e., treat a disadvantaged member of society unjustly with the effect of causing one to suffer ill-treatment” (Swanson 1997).</p>
<p>Although the Hebrew of this verse is quite difficult and there is little concurrence among commentators as to its proper interpretation (Whybray 1994, 322-323), the sense of it seems to be that <strong>the end result of oppressing the impoverished for material gain is only further poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>Proverbs 30:14 comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses make the transition from descriptions of poverty to responses to its existence, highlighting the uncomfortable truth that <strong>improper treatment of the poor can bring disaster</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="responses-to-poverty-yahweh-and-the-poor">Responses to Poverty: Yahweh and the Poor</h2>
<p>It is clear that Proverbs gives its readers a thorough understanding of the dreadfulness of poverty and the importance of avoiding it.</p>
<p>However, this understanding does little to inform the audience of <strong>how we should respond to the existence of poverty</strong>.</p>
<p>The surest foundation for a proper response to poverty is undoubtedly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the character of Yahweh with regards to the oppressed and impoverished</span>.</p>
<p>Consider Proverbs 14:31:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first line of this proverb is echoed in 17:5a, and the second (seemingly unrelated) line of 17:5, “he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished,” has been taken by some commentators to refer to those who rejoice over not just calamity in general, but specifically the ruin of the poor (Whybray 1994, 255 and Clifford 1999, 164).</p>
<p>If this is the case, then these two proverbs taken together make the same point with both a positive promise and a negative warning. Clifford states the main point particularly well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The dignity of each human being comes from being created by God. Contempt towards anyone insults the person’s maker. The example of the poor person, the type perhaps least likely to gain respect, is used to dramatize the point. Every human being, irrespective of wealth, is worthy of respect” (1999, 164).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same point is made in Proverbs 22:2, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and also in 29:13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Our treatment of the poor needs to be based upon the fact that they have been made in the image of Yahweh and are therefore worthy of dignity and respect.</strong> To deny them the treatment that each and every human being deserves is not just stinginess, it is <strong>an insult and an offense to the Creator.</strong></p>
<p>However, Proverbs goes further than appeals to imago Dei in its teachings about our treatment of the poor.</p>
<p>Atkinson says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The oppression of the poor is both a violation of someone who should be respected because he or she bears the image of the Creator, and also an attitude which does not reflect the character of the Creator, who is himself on the side of the poor” (1996, 111).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 22:22-23 delivers a stunningly vivid warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do not rob the poor, because he is poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate, for the LORD will plead their cause and rob of life those who rob them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader is told to not take justice from the poor because they have the LORD as their defender at the gate (the site of legal proceedings). “The poor, by not having human protectors, have Yahweh as their protector. Paradoxically, their poverty gives them a more powerful protector than the rich could afford” (Clifford 1999, 207).</p>
<p>This gives a glimpse into a thematic truth of Scripture that has been called God’s “bias to the poor.” Atkinson quotes Karl Barth to further explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The human righteousness required by God and established in obedience – the righteousness which according to Amos 5:24 should pour down as a mighty stream – has necessarily the character of a vindication of right in favour of the threatened innocent, the oppressed poor, widows, orphans, and aliens.</p>
<p>For this reason, in the relations and events in the life of his people, God always takes his stand unconditionally and passionately on this side and this side alone: against the lofty and on behalf of the lowly; against those who enjoy right and privilege and on behalf of those who are denied it and deprived of it” (1996, 111-112, cf. Barth, <em>Church Dogmatics</em> II/1 [T.&amp;T. Clark, 1957], p. 387)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>God’s heart for and even bias toward the poor extends well beyond the book of Proverbs</strong>. If one pays close attention, it is readily apparent that Scripture is saturated with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahweh intervened to save his people from the oppression and poverty they suffered in at the hands of the Egyptians (cf. Exodus 3:7-9).</li>
<li>He made his frustration at his people’s improper treatment and distortion of the impoverished and the needy known through the prophets (cf. Isaiah 10:1-3; Jeremiah 5:26-29; 7:5-7; Amos 2:7; 4:1; 5:10-15; 6:4-7; Micah 2:2).</li>
<li>Jesus the Messiah cited his own mission as one that was inextricably tied to the poor and oppressed (cf. Luke 4:16-21).</li>
<li>The final judgment will be executed (at least partially so) with regards to the treatment (or mistreatment) of the poor and the needy (cf. Matthew 25:31-46).</li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture makes it abundantly clear that <strong>God’s heart is for the impoverished, destitute, and oppressed</strong>.</p>
<p>It is important to establish this truth well in order to rightly proceed in our actions and attitudes toward the poor and the oppressed. This is because <strong>it is entirely too easy to think of God’s actions and attitudes as being most closely aligned with people who are just like us.</strong></p>
<p>However, for the vast majority of Christians in the United States who live life in relatively extravagant comfort and ease, it comes as somewhat of a shock that God’s bias might actually be <em><strong>against</strong></em> us if we do not take this issue seriously!</p>
<p>Proverbs reflects that what is at stake here is much more than just our consciences, the minor twangs of guilt or moments of self-righteousness we too often experience in our infrequent interactions with the poor.</p>
<h2 id="responses-to-poverty-consequences-and-rewards">Responses to Poverty: Consequences and Rewards</h2>
<p>The teachings in Proverbs regarding the treatment of the poor can be divided into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>those that display negative consequences for improper treatment,</li>
<li>those that display positive rewards for proper treatment,</li>
<li>and those that juxtapose the two.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="negative-consequences">Negative Consequences</h3>
<p>Proverbs 21:13 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever closes his ears to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The frightening reciprocity of this verse hits hard when, in our culture, we are too often distracted by other things which are “more important” than attending to the needs of the poor. When we find ourselves in a moment of dire need, how can we expect to be answered if we have not answered the needy when we were able to do so?</p>
<p>Another warning against mistreating the poor that includes a form of retribution against the offender is Proverbs 28:8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit gathers is for him who is generous to the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whybray claims that the word for “interest” refers to “interest which was levied by deduction from the original loan but which had to be repaid in full,” and that “profit” refers to “an additional charge levied on repayment” (1994, 391).</p>
<p>The point is that <strong>money taken from the poor will not do its wicked owner any good,</strong> and has the potential to end up in the hands of righteous men which will in turn help to meet the needs of the poor.</p>
<h3 id="positive-rewards">Positive Rewards</h3>
<p>In addition, Proverbs contains several verses that positively portray, and thereby encourage, generosity towards the poor and preservation of their justice.</p>
<p>Consider Proverbs 19:17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proverb promises a reward to those who treat the poor with generosity. However, the main point is not to treat them with benevolence out of desire for a reward.</p>
<p>Whybray captures the point well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“there is no idea here of a quid pro quo: no intention to encourage generosity simply for the reward which it will bring. The underlying thought is that generosity is characteristic of a person who is righteous; and the proverb reflects the basic belief that righteousness is, and ought to be, materially rewarded” (1994, 282).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A virtually identical point is made in Proverbs 22:9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the well-known wise woman discussed in chapter 31 “opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy” (31:20). <strong>Giving generously to the poor is a mark of a righteous person, one whose life will be blessed by Yahweh.</strong></p>
<h3 id="combinations">Combinations</h3>
<p>Finally, some proverbs combine the negative and positive aspects of the previously mentioned verses through antithetical parallelism.</p>
<p>A prime example is Proverbs 14:21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner, but blessed is he who is generous to the poor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse highlights the benefits of generosity against the backdrop of the consequences of scorning one’s neighbor.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, Proverbs 28:27 says that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not the curses come from the poor who have been denied assistance, or from Yahweh himself, the point remains that <strong>there are rewards in caring for the impoverished and consequences for not doing so.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to generosity, however, the Hebrew sages also expressed concern for the <strong>justice</strong> of the poor.</p>
<p>Proverbs 29:7 makes it clear that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of justice for the poor is also stated later in the chapter in verse 14:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a king faithfully judges the poor, his throne will be established forever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given Yahweh’s “bias” toward the poor and their status as his image bearers, it would do one well to be concerned with their legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>It is not enough to simply not oppress the poor.</strong> Proverbs, along with the rest of Scripture, seems to mandate <strong>advocating for their justice.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In our current context of extravagant wealth and abject poverty existing side by side in a realm of confusion, apathy, and even malice towards the impoverished, Proverbs contains some timely and powerful teaching.</p>
<p>The Hebrew sages had a firm grasp on both the tempting causes and terrible effects of poverty. They, therefore, put a strong emphasis on <strong>avoiding it at all costs through diligence and hard work</strong>.</p>
<p>However, this did not lead them to <strong>abandon</strong> a proper view towards the poor, and they grounded all of their teachings about the proper treatment of the poor in <strong>the unchanging and perfect character of Yahweh, who is firmly committed to their protection and justice.</strong></p>
<p>The modern readers of this ancient book would do well to heed its teachings regarding poverty, and to proceed with attitudes and actions in imitation of Yahweh in their interactions with and opinions of the poor, destitute, and oppressed of this world.</p>

&lt;p&gt;The following is my valedictorian speech, delivered at my high school graduation in 2009. As you’ll see below, the majority of the speech was an original poem. Sure, I’m tempted to be a bit embarrassed by the poem today, but I’m also proud that I went for it. Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The following is my valedictorian speech, delivered at my high school graduation in 2009. As you’ll see below, the majority of the speech was an original poem. Sure, I’m tempted to be a bit embarrassed by the poem today, but I’m also proud that I went for it. Let me know what you think!</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="graduation">GRADUATION!</h1>
<p>Such a mix of emotions comes with this simple word…</p>
<p><strong>Students</strong> are exhilarated to finally be done with yet another chapter of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Parents</strong> are also excited, yet saddened perhaps by the fact that their little babies are now about to embark into the real world.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty</strong> are relieved to get such a motley group of troublemakers out of their school!Guests are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony,</p>
<p><strong>Guests</strong> are happy to watch it all come together in one orchestrated ceremony, which is customarily concluded by a farewell address from the graduating <strong>valedictorian</strong>:</p>
<p>A poor individual who must say goodbye while also addressing all parties and emotions involved, all within the space of a short speech.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mrs. Covrett, my English teacher, taught me that <strong>poetry</strong> is the language of both emotion and economy.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, amidst the trials and tribulations of AP English Literature and Composition, we read a poem entitled <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44131/a-valediction-forbidding-mourning">“A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning</a>.”</p>
<p>This poem, written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne">John Donne</a> about a love that transcends physical separation between him and his beloved, inspired me to compose my own work in the interests of avoiding both triteness and plagiarism on this most auspicious occasion.</p>
<p>Now, John Donne forbade his beloved from openly mourning his departure.</p>
<p>While I do not think it fitting for me to forbid anyone anything, please indulge me a few moments of your time as we look both back at the past and ahead into the future by way of my poem, entitled:</p>
<h1 id="a-valediction">A VALEDICTION</h1>
<p>The years, a road before us<br>
This school, the path behind<br>
And who can know what lies ahead?<br>
The twists and turns we’ll find</p>
<p>Our time, it passes swiftly,<br>
This life will soon be gone<br>
When we look back upon our days,<br>
What is it we’ll have done?</p>
<p>The world has many pleasures<br>
its riches and its fame<br>
Yet none of these are lasting treasures<br>
for all face death the same</p>
<p>We’ve all one life to use now,<br>
Our time will soon be past<br>
And though this world will pass away,<br>
What’s done for Christ will last.</p>
<p>For years, we’ve learned and grown here,<br>
a foundation has been laid.<br>
The future looms before us now,<br>
a choice has to be made:</p>
<p>To waste our lives upon ourselves?<br>
To build on sinking sand?<br>
Or found ourselves upon the Rock,<br>
Who holds us in His hands?</p>
<p>The choice may seem quite simple now,<br>
as though the battle’s won,<br>
but day by day, the world cries out<br>
“Don’t fret! Go play! Have fun!”</p>
<p>Our lives will have their share of joy,<br>
Good gifts from God each day.<br>
But don’t be fooled, there’s pain as well<br>
There’s bumps along our way.</p>
<p>Should we be scared? Can we succeed?<br>
Is there hope amidst the fear?<br>
Will we press on? or stop to heed<br>
those voices in our ear:</p>
<p>“Turn back! This way is difficult!<br>
It’s much too hard for you!<br>
Too frightening, there’s no comfort there,<br>
You’ll never make it through!”</p>
<p>Don’t stop! Press on! For don’t we know?<br>
and have not we been told?<br>
It’s only through the fire<br>
You obtain the purest gold.</p>
<p>We have a God in Heaven<br>
A Father and a Guide<br>
He gives the strength to carry on<br>
To those who would reside</p>
<p>in Him. we find our purpose<br>
In Him we find the way<br>
to live our lives unwasted<br>
,to boldly face each day.</p>
<p>For He alone knows how much time<br>
we have to walk the road<br>
And He alone knows every trial,<br>
The weight of each our loads</p>
<p>Though high school is now over<br>
We’ve so much more to do!<br>
The door has been flung-open,<br>
and now we must walk through–</p>
<p>We’ll miss the loving people here<br>
Who’ve helped us on our way.<br>
Though time and distance come between,<br>
Our thankfulness won’t fade.</p>
<p>So, Mom and Dad, we thank you for<br>
The time and love you give.<br>
You’ve been there through our best and worst<br>
To show us how to live.</p>
<p>Our teachers, better mentors<br>
We would be hard-pressed to find.<br>
They’ve taught us both to seek the Truth<br>
And always guard our minds.</p>
<p>So many more deserve our thanks,<br>
Yet words cannot convey<br>
The boundless debt of gratitude<br>
That we should rightly pay.</p>
<p>And now we say “farewell”<br>
“Goodbye,” as we depart.<br>
One journey ends, another’s here<br>
on which we must embark.</p>
