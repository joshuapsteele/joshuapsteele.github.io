<p>We have sought satisfaction in this world’s pleasures rather than in You.</p>
<p>We have loved to praise our own glory more than yours.</p>
<p><strong>We have taken your name in vain.</strong></p>
<p>We have prayed religious prayers to impress others.</p>
<p>We have uttered your name countless times without reverence or love.</p>
<p>We have listened to others use your name in vain without grieving.</p>
<p><strong>We have murdered in our hearts.</strong></p>
<p>We have often destroyed our neighbor with our tongues.</p>
<p>We have been quick to uncharitably judge others.</p>
<p>We have considered revenge when we were sinned against.</p>
<p><strong>We have committed adultery with our eyes.</strong></p>
<p>We have loved temptation rather than fighting it.</p>
<p>We have lusted after unlawful and immoral pleasures.</p>
<p>We have justified our lusts by using the world as our standard.</p>
<p><strong>We have stolen what is not ours and coveted what belongs to others.</strong></p>
<p>Our lives overflow with discontent, ungratefulness, and envy.</p>
<p>We have complained in the midst of Your abundant provision.</p>
<p>We have sought to exalt ourselves through owning more.</p>
