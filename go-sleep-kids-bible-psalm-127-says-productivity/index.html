Steele</title>
<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="Personal Productivity in Psalm 127
I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).
Here’s how the Psalm opens:

Unless the Lord builds the house,
 the builders labor in vain.
Unless the Lord watches over the city,
 the guards stand watch in vain.

I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts."><meta name=author content="joshuapsteele"><link rel=canonical href=https://joshuapsteele.github.io/go-sleep-kids-bible-psalm-127-says-productivity/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.fc220c15db4aef0318bbf30adc45d33d4d7c88deff3238b23eb255afdc472ca6.css integrity="sha256-/CIMFdtK7wMYu/MK3EXTPU18iN7/MjiyPrJVr9xHLKY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://joshuapsteele.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://joshuapsteele.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://joshuapsteele.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://joshuapsteele.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://joshuapsteele.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://joshuapsteele.github.io/go-sleep-kids-bible-psalm-127-says-productivity/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Go to Sleep and Have Some Kids: What the Bible (Psalm 127) Says about Productivity"><meta property="og:description" content="Personal Productivity in Psalm 127

Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).\nHere’s how the Psalm opens:\nUnless the Lord builds the house,\nthe builders labor in vain.\nUnless the Lord watches over the city,\nthe guards stand watch in vain.\nI don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.\nNot true! It doesn’t matter how hard you work. If the Lord is not behind it and in favor of it, you’ll be laboring in vain.\nNow, of course, this Psalm doesn’t undo the Bible other admonitions to work diligently, lest you fall into poverty (see my post about Poverty in the book of Proverbs).\nHowever, it does have implications for when we go to bed!\nGo to Sleep Verse 2 reads:\nIn vain you rise early\nand stay up late,\ntoiling for food to eat—\nfor he grants sleep to those he loves.\nThankfully, personal productivity advice these days has come around to recognizing the vital importance of sleep for your health.\nHowever, I don’t know about you, but I often feel the nagging temptation that, if only I could squeeze a few extra hours out of the day, I could turn things around. To be perfectly honest, this is one of the reasons why I try to get up early (~5:00am) most mornings.\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with getting up early in the morning. After all, Jesus himself did so, in order to pray (see Mark 1:35).\nHowever, if you’re staying up late and getting up early in order to toil away because you think your work and success depends only on your efforts, then this Psalm encourages you to go to bed. Get some sleep. Learn to receive each day, along with exactly as much time as it contains, as a gift from God.\nHave Some Kids The second part of the Psalm hits close to home as well! (See my previous post: 3 Confessions of an Expectant Father.)\nVerses 3-5 read:\nChildren are a heritage from the Lord,\noffspring a reward from him.\nLike arrows in the hands of a warrior\nare children born in one’s youth.\nBlessed is the man\nwhose quiver is full of them.\nThey will not be put to shame\nwhen they contend with their opponents in court.\nDISCLAIMER: I don’t have space here to address the complicated issue of infertility or other things that get in the way of having children. Just know that these verses don’t negate the fact that God loves and draws near to people going through such things in their times of pain.\nNevertheless, these verses also teach an important truth: children are a blessing from God.\nDon’t get me wrong, I love kids. And, as I’ve said in my previous post, I’m excited to be a dad!\nAnd yet, I think that I’m going to need this Psalm as a frequent reminder in the days and years ahead! Personal productivity advice has come around to the idea of sleep being important, but I don’t know if there’s broad consensus on children always being considered a blessing! If you ask many people, the jury is still out on whether or not having children makes you happier – much less more productive!!\nReminders of Our Finitude So, I think this Psalm is a countercultural reminder that both sleep and children are good gifts from God.\nThey are BOTH reminders that we are finite creatures who cannot accomplish everything (or even anything meaningful) on our own. Instead, even though we are called to make the best use of our time, we are to receive each day as a gift from God – recognizing that, without his constant provision and sustenance, we would perish.\nSo, take heart! Go to bed a little earlier tonight! Everything doesn’t depend on you.\nHow would your sleep habits and/or your plans for the future change if you took Psalm 127 to heart?
