# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is Joshua P. Steele's personal website built with Hugo static site generator using the PaperMod theme. The site is deployed via GitHub Pages with automated builds.

## Site Architecture

- **Static Site Generator**: Hugo
- **Theme**: PaperMod
- **Content Structure**: 
  - `content/blog/` - Blog posts (400+ markdown files)
  - `content/pages/` - Static pages (about, contact, cv, etc.)
  - `content/search.md` - Search functionality
- **Layouts**: Custom Hugo layouts in `layouts/` directory
  - Custom shortcodes for audio, figure, files-list, and gallery
  - Partials for comments, analytics, and site components
- **Static Assets**: Images and files in `static/` directory
- **Configuration**: `hugo.yaml` (main site configuration)

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Start Hugo development server (if Hugo is installed)
hugo server

# Build site for production
hugo

# Deploy to GitHub (using custom script)
./deploy.sh "Optional commit message"
```

### Deployment
The site uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment. The `deploy.sh` script handles:
1. Adding changes to git
2. Committing with timestamp or custom message
3. Pushing to main branch (triggers GitHub Actions build)
