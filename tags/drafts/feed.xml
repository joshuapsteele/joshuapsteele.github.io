Since I’m a software engineer and spend my day in front of a screen, I enjoy working with tools as a change of pace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, some upcoming projects will clearly outstrip my capabilities and I plan to hire professionals:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>– Replace roof and gutters&lt;br>
– Replace furnace and central air conditioning&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Problem of Ecclesiastical Evil</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-problem-of-ecclesiastical-evil/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 12:26:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-problem-of-ecclesiastical-evil/</guid><description>&lt;p>You’ve probably heard of “the problem of evil” (if not, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil">here’s an overview&lt;/a>). But there’s a specific version/aspect of it that I find even more devastating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If God is omnipotent (all-powerful), ommniscient (all-knowing(, and omnibenevolent (completely good)…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the Church is God’s main plan for the redemption of humanity and the cosmos (consider the “body of Christ” paradigm in the New Testament)…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the gospel of Jesus Christ has had ~2K years to percolate in and through the Church…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Back in the Saddle</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/back-in-the-saddle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 21:24:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/back-in-the-saddle/</guid><description>&lt;p>I know I’m not alone in this, but the past few years have been pretty rough for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I’ve gained at least 50 pounds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I had a fun part-time gig as a managing editor come to an end.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I’ve come to terms with some &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/its-time-to-get-some-help/">long-term depression and anxiety&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I had a job offer ripped out from under me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/its-official-im-hitting-pause-on-my-ph-d-for-a-year/">hit pause&lt;/a> on and eventually dropped out of my Ph.D. program.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I’ve &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/">resigned from ordained ministry in the ACNA&lt;/a>, my previous denomination.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Truth to Power</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/truth-to-power/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 12:06:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/truth-to-power/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mark 6:13-29. John the Baptist lost his life for speaking truth to power. Are we willing to speak truth to power? To tell the truth about power and the power of truth? Or will we abandon the truth to obtain and maintain power?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
