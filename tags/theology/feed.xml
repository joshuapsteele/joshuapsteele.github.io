&lt;p>If I could go back in time and chat with Joshua Steele when he was a Bible &amp;amp; Spanish major in college, there are a few things I’d tell my younger self:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Quit laughing at &lt;em>How to Read a Book&lt;/em> by Mortimer J. Adler and READ the thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Baba ghanoush is superior to hummus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Study computer science sooner rather than later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bite the bullet and INVEST IN A LOGOS BIBLE SOFTWARE LIBRARY.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Don’t get me wrong. I love physical books as much as anyone, and I own quite a few (hundred)!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Help! I’m looking for the best Christian resources on the Bible, social justice, racism, Critical Race Theory, and Marxism</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/help-im-looking-for-the-best-christian-resources-on-the-bible-social-justice-racism-critical-race-theory-and-marxism/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 17:01:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/help-im-looking-for-the-best-christian-resources-on-the-bible-social-justice-racism-critical-race-theory-and-marxism/</guid><description>&lt;p>Help me out. I’m looking for the best, clearest, and most charitable explanations of the following three things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the biblical and theological reasons for caring about social justice and systemic racism,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the unfair ways in which some have used accusations of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Cultural Marxism to sideline legitimate Christian concerns about social justice and systemic racism, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the legitimate Christian critiques of CRT and Marxism.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now, I &lt;em>know&lt;/em> that there are plenty of resources out there that address each of the three items above!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There's more than one kind of "priesthood" in the New Testament</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/theres-more-than-one-kind-of-priesthood-in-the-new-testament/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2019 20:47:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/theres-more-than-one-kind-of-priesthood-in-the-new-testament/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just came across &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nbfr.12440">this article in New Blackfriars&lt;/a>, and it looks helpful, especially in the context of Anglican debates about women’s ordination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Author: Geoffrey Turner&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What's the relationship between biblical and systematic/dogmatic theology?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/whats-the-relationship-between-biblical-and-systematic-dogmatic-theology/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:18:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/whats-the-relationship-between-biblical-and-systematic-dogmatic-theology/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the question we’re considering this week in our doctoral seminar on biblical and theological integration. Two of us are theologians and the other four are bible scholars. Should be interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(Note: we’ll have to save the difference(s) between systematic, historical, and dogmatic theology for another post!)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the articles we were assigned to read for this week:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Other than that, for the rest of the semester, we’re reading at least selections from the following works. The goal is to learn from examples of biblical and theological integration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Christian Theology: A Draft Syllabus</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/introduction-to-christian-theology-a-draft-syllabus/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 22:42:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/introduction-to-christian-theology-a-draft-syllabus/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>As a part of my “pedagogical experience” at Wheaton College this semester, I was required to draft a syllabus for an introduction to Christian theology.

&lt;h1 id="course-description">Course Description&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This course is an introduction to the methods of systematic theology and the major topics within biblical revelation. Special attention is given to the rationale for these Christian doctrines, their systematic interconnections as well as their development within the history of Christian thought, and their contemporary challenges. This class is your opportunity to reinforce why you believe what you believe and to examine how it impacts your life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mental Models: A Helpful Model for Theology?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/mental-models-helpful-model-theology/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2018 15:06:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/mental-models-helpful-model-theology/</guid><description>&lt;p>This idea has been bouncing around in my head for a bit. It’s not fully-formed by any means, but I’d like to get it out there and hear what you think of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here it is: “Mental Models” could be a helpful model for theology.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-a-mental-model">What is a “mental model”?&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-mental-models">Definition of mental models&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Put simply, a “mental model” is a concept used to help explain how the world works.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
