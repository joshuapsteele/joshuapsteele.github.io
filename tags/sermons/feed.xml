&lt;p>Christians believe that there is one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or, as my daughter Eva put it recently after seeing a picture in her book, “Father, Son, and Bird.” We’re working on that…&lt;/p>

Modalism, bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preparing the Way of the Lord in the Wilderness: Luke 3:1-6</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-in-the-wilderness-luke-31-6/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Dec 2018 15:42:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-in-the-wilderness-luke-31-6/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’d like to pray this week’s collect again:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
