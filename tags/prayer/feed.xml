&lt;p>O Father of mercies and God of all comfort, our only help in time of need: We humbly beseech thee to behold, visit, and relieve thy sick servant &lt;em>N.&lt;/em> for whom our prayers are desired. Look upon &lt;em>him&lt;/em> with the eyes of thy mercy; comfort &lt;em>him&lt;/em> with a sense of thy goodness; preserve &lt;em>him&lt;/em> from the temptations of the enemy; and give &lt;em>him&lt;/em> patience under &lt;em>his&lt;/em> affliction. In thy good time, restore &lt;em>him&lt;/em> to health, and enable &lt;em>him&lt;/em> to lead the residue of &lt;em>his&lt;/em> life in thy fear, and to thy glory; and grant that finally he may dwell with thee in life everlasting; through Jesus Christ our Lord. &lt;em>Amen.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Prayer for Trustfulness in Times of Worry and Anxiety</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/a-prayer-for-trustfulness-in-times-of-worry-and-anxiety/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 13:03:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/a-prayer-for-trustfulness-in-times-of-worry-and-anxiety/</guid><description>&lt;p>I needed this prayer this morning, and I plan to return to it often in the days ahead.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most loving Father, you will us to give thanks for all things, to dread nothing but the loss of you, and to cast all our care on the One who cares for us. Preserve us from faithless fears and worldly anxieties, and grant that no clouds of this mortal life may hide from us the light of that love which is immortal, and which you have manifested unto us in your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Collect for Juneteenth</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/a-collect-for-juneteenth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 03:06:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/a-collect-for-juneteenth/</guid><description>&lt;p>The following is a “collect” prayer that I composed for Juneteenth in 2020. What’s a “collect” prayer?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The short form of prayer, constructed (with many varieties of detail) from (1) an invocation, (2) a petition, and (3) a pleading of Christ’s name or an ascription of glory to God; and one of the most characteristic items in the W[estern] liturgy.&lt;/p>
