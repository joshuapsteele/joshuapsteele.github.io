But I’m wondering how we Anglican Christians ought to be careful to keep our precious “via media” (“middle way”) mentality and methodology separate from what’s known as the “middle ground” fallacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-via-media">The “Via Media”&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>According to Donald McKim in the &lt;em>Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms&lt;/em>, the “via media” is&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>(Lat. “the middle way”) Term used to describe the identity of Anglicanism as a middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. It was coined by John Henry Newman (1801–90) during the Oxford movement (337).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Women's Ordination Debates in Anglicanism: The 2017 ACNA Report and the 2003 AMIA Report</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/womens-ordination-debates-in-anglicanism-the-2017-acna-report-and-the-2003-amia-report/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 14:17:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/womens-ordination-debates-in-anglicanism-the-2017-acna-report-and-the-2003-amia-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>I became an “egalitarian” in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women’s ordination debate within Anglicanism. Growing up, the debate was all about particular Bible verses and whether or not women could teach and preach. However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Attracts People to Anglicanism?

&lt;p>Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Top 3 Reasons Why I'm an Anglican Christian</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/top-3-reasons-im-anglican-christian/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 05:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/top-3-reasons-im-anglican-christian/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">&lt;img loading="lazy" src="http://anglicanpastor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/RA-Logo-Black-Transparent-Background-200x167.png" alt="" />

&lt;p>Why am I an Anglican Christian? Here are 3 reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="1-anglicanism-as-a-refuge-from-fundamentalism">1. Anglicanism as a Refuge from Fundamentalism&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>First, for me, Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism. Now, to be sure, we do have our own fundamentalists within the Anglican Communion! But, compared to some “ingrown enclaves” I’ve experienced in my Christian upbringing, Anglicanism has been a breath of fresh air. It has been an ecclesiological space for healing as I seek to “&lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/08/on-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater-a-message-for-abused-ex-fundamentalists/">not throw the (gospel) baby out with the (fundamentalist) bathwater&lt;/a>.”&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
