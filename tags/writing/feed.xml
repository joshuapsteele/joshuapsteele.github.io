&lt;p>Upgrading would help me in my preaching, teaching, and writing roles (as a pastor-theologian and as the Managing Editor of AnglicanCompass.com). I’ve already benefited immensely from the Anglican Silver package I bought when I got into the Logos Bible Software ecosystem a couple years ago (mainly to gain easy digital access to Barth and Bonhoeffer’s writings for my dissertation). I plan to stick with Logos—especially for biblical commentaries, systematic theologies, and reference works—because it allows me to quickly research, prepare for sermons, answer questions from readers, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>They Say, I Say Writing Templates</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/they-say-i-say-writing-templates/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:40:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/they-say-i-say-writing-templates/</guid><description>&lt;p>SOURCE: &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3eOMlXF">&lt;em>They Say / I Say: The Moves that Matter in Academic Writing&lt;/em>&lt;/a>, 4th edition (affiliate link).

&lt;p>Thankfully, I’ve come across some helpful advice on overcoming writer’s block in Andrew T. Le Peau’s &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2ZuTZC3">&lt;em>Writer Better: A Lifelong Editor on Craft, Art, and Spirituality&lt;/em>&lt;/a> (affiliate link).&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The precise meaning of the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil” (=TK) has long vexed interpreters of Genesis 2:4–3:24.&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#post-41779-footnote-1">[1]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> While the “tree of life” (=TL) is mentioned and alluded to throughout the Bible, the TK is explicitly mentioned by its full name just twice (Gen. 2:9, 17).&lt;sup>&lt;sup>&lt;a href="#post-41779-footnote-2">[2]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/sup> Nevertheless, because of the significant role that the TK plays in the narrative, both Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Karl Barth highlight the TK in their theological interpretations of Genesis 1–3. Furthermore, both theologians describe the TK and the knowledge of good and evil (=KGE) in ways that resemble their theological critiques of “religion” as an improper response to divine revelation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When will Thy Kingdom Come?

&lt;h2 id="introduction-thy-kingdom-haswill-come">Introduction: “Thy Kingdom [Has/Will] Come”?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just how &lt;em>eschatological&lt;/em> is the Lord’s Prayer (=LP; Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4), particularly in light of its second petition, “Your kingdom come” (ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου, Matt. 6:10a; Luke 11:2d)? In other words, when will God’s kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)? Furthermore, who brings the kingdom about? Humans? God? Or some combination of the two? Settling the question of eschatology involves both the timing and the agency, the &lt;em>when&lt;/em> and the &lt;em>who&lt;/em>, of the kingdom.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spirit, Flesh, Restoration, and Sublimation</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/spirit-flesh-restoration-and-sublimation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 18:25:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/spirit-flesh-restoration-and-sublimation/</guid><description>&lt;p>There’s an intriguing passage in Bonhoeffer’s Letters and Papers from Prison where he discusses the relationship between “spirit” and “flesh,” in the context of discussing “restoration” and “sublimation,” in the context of discussing lyrics from certain hymns and songs that were meaningful to him in prison.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here it is, from a December 19, 1943 (the Fourth Sunday of Advent) letter to Eberhard Bethge:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In recent weeks this line has been running through my head over and over: “Calm your hearts, dear friends; / whatever plagues you, / whatever fails you, / I will restore it all.” What does that mean, “I will restore it all”? Nothing is lost; in Christ all things are taken up, preserved, albeit in transfigured form, transparent, clear, liberated from the torment of self-serving demands. Christ brings all this back, indeed, as God intended, without being distorted by sin. The doctrine originating in Eph. 1:10 of the restoration of all things, ἀνακεφαλαίωσις—re-capitulatio (Irenaeus), is a magnificent and consummately consoling thought. (DBWE 8:229–30)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Help me StickK to my writing habit</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 14:44:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/</guid><description>&lt;p>I need to finish &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/">this dissertation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do so, I need to write regularly. For me, that means writing every day—a minimum of 500 words every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last spring, I did a pretty good job of writing regularly. However, I’ve fallen off the wagon for various reasons, and it’s been a bear to get back on!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I’ve decided to put some money on the line, using a service called StickK.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This is a fantastic wooden pencil (Mitsubishi 9850)</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/this-is-a-fantastic-wooden-pencil-mitsubishi-9850/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/this-is-a-fantastic-wooden-pencil-mitsubishi-9850/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just wanted to give a quick shout-out to this fantastic pencil: &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2QcXI2B">the Mitsubishi 9850&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
