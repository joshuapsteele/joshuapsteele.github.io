&lt;p>Upgrading would help me in my preaching, teaching, and writing roles (as a pastor-theologian and as the Managing Editor of AnglicanCompass.com). I’ve already benefited immensely from the Anglican Silver package I bought when I got into the Logos Bible Software ecosystem a couple years ago (mainly to gain easy digital access to Barth and Bonhoeffer’s writings for my dissertation). I plan to stick with Logos—especially for biblical commentaries, systematic theologies, and reference works—because it allows me to quickly research, prepare for sermons, answer questions from readers, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Following Christ as a Hermeneutical Problem?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/following-christ-as-a-hermeneutical-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 13:58:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/following-christ-as-a-hermeneutical-problem/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m trying to puzzle out the meaning of the following paragraph from Bonhoeffer’s &lt;em>Discipleship&lt;/em> (DBWE 4).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Fundamentally eliminating simple obedience introduces a principle of scripture foreign to the Gospel.&lt;sup>[19]&lt;/sup> According to it, in order to understand scripture, one first must have a key to interpreting it. But that key would not be the living Christ himself in judgment and grace, and using the key would not be according to the will of the living Holy Spirit alone. Rather, the key to scripture would be a general doctrine of grace, and we ourselves would decide its use. The problem of following Christ shows itself here to be a hermeneutical problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What blogs are you reading?</title><link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/what-blogs-are-you-reading/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2019 20:53:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/what-blogs-are-you-reading/</guid><description>&lt;p>Right now, I’m using the RSS readers &lt;a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder&lt;/a> to subscribe to the following blogs:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Anyways, in case you’re interested, I thought I’d share what I’ll be reading for each course.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>What are the key Christian teachings being articulated? What is the author’s driving concern or main theme?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What counts for the author as authoritative (Scripture, tradition, reason, experience…)? Is the author’s theological method implicit or explicit?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How does the author deal with the witness of Scripture?&lt;br>
a. Implicitly? Explicitly?&lt;br>
b. Does the witness of the Old Testament matter? The New?&lt;br>
c. What biblical themes are privileged?&lt;br>
d. What interpretive principles are at work?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do these claims relate to other doctrines?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How does context (including gender, race, class, culture, and time) shape the theological voice? Is the theologian conscious of this? How does your context shape your evaluation of the piece?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practice reading charitably. What is the best possible interpretation of how the piece reflects an attempt to be faithful to Jesus Christ?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do these theological claims relate to the life of faith? Doe you bring other questions from your experience?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If this theological proposal were taken seriously, how would it shape Christian practice? Would it affect our participation in spiritual disciplines? Our understanding of faithful living? Our practice of evangelism? Our life as the church?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

We can learn, from other minds, from other times, just by looking at symbols on a screen or a page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, I mean, come on. Who has enough time to read? I don’t know about you, but I’ve got a stack of books a mile high that I’d like to work my way through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, there’s a bunch of good advice out there about &lt;strong>finding more time to read&lt;/strong> (see &lt;a href="https://www.fs.blog/2013/09/finding-time-to-read/">this post from Farnam Street&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2018/02/26/how-to-read-more-books/">this post from The Art of Manliness&lt;/a>). In fact, finding more time to read is one of the main reasons why you should learn the basics of personal productivity and time management (see &lt;a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/category/productivity-and-time-management/">my posts about productivity and time management&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
