        8 Questions to Ask While Reading Theology
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>While reading Beth Felker Jones’ <a href="https://amzn.to/2vLkeEo"><em>Practicing Christian Doctrine: An Introduction to Thinking and Living Theologically</em></a>, I came across the following list of extremely helpful questions to ask while reading theology (on page 29).</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What are the key Christian teachings being articulated? What is the author’s driving concern or main theme?</li>
<li>What counts for the author as authoritative (Scripture, tradition, reason, experience…)? Is the author’s theological method implicit or explicit?</li>
<li>How does the author deal with the witness of Scripture?<br>
a. Implicitly? Explicitly?<br>
b. Does the witness of the Old Testament matter? The New?<br>
c. What biblical themes are privileged?<br>
d. What interpretive principles are at work?</li>
<li>How do these claims relate to other doctrines?</li>
<li>How does context (including gender, race, class, culture, and time) shape the theological voice? Is the theologian conscious of this? How does your context shape your evaluation of the piece?</li>
<li>Practice reading charitably. What is the best possible interpretation of how the piece reflects an attempt to be faithful to Jesus Christ?</li>
<li>How do these theological claims relate to the life of faith? Doe you bring other questions from your experience?</li>
<li>If this theological proposal were taken seriously, how would it shape Christian practice? Would it affect our participation in spiritual disciplines? Our understanding of faithful living? Our practice of evangelism? Our life as the church?</li>
</ol>

        What Theologians (Should) Do
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Kevin J. Vanhoozer, affectionately known by some as “KJV,” has written <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/08/letter-to-an-aspiring-theologian">one of the best, briefest overviews of what theologians (should) do</a>.</p>
<p>The entire piece is filled with gems like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To become a theologian, you must be willing to bear true witness and call out false witnesses, casting down idols and ideologies. That’s the shadow side of theology, but the best part is speaking light and truth in astonished indications of God’s goodness. I love John Webster’s definition of theology: “that delightful activity in which the Church praises God by ordering its thinking towards the gospel of Christ.” Being a theologian means getting to have not necessarily the last word, but the word about last things, “the end for which God created the world” (to cite the title of a dissertation by Jonathan Edwards). It’s not only a good word but the best of all possible words, namely, that God glorifies humans and all creation, magnifying his own glory and subjecting all things to the Lordship of Christ, so that “God may be all in all” (1 Cor. 15:28). It’s the privilege of the theologian to bear witness to the length, depth, breadth, and width of the cross and Resurrection. Karl Barth is right: “The theologian who has no joy in his work is not a theologian at all.”</p>

        What Attracts People to Anglicanism? Here&#39;s My Take

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Based upon my work over at <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">Rookie Anglican</a>, I was asked by <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com/">The Telos Collective</a> to write a blog post about the different ways that people are coming into Anglicanism. What’s drawing them in?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com/what-attracts-people-to-anglicanism-subversive-cultural-resonance/">read my full post over at the Telos Collective blog</a>, but here’s a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).</p>

      <p>Previously, <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/what-to-make-of-jordan-peterson-some-takes-then-my-own/">I catalogued a bunch of different takes on Jordan Peterson, before giving my own take</a>.</p>
<p>Since that post, two other pieces about Jordan Peterson have been written that I’d like to share.</p>
<h1 id="jordan-peterson-custodian-of-the-patriarchy-by-nellie-bowles-new-york-times">“Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy,” by Nellie Bowles (New York Times)</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html">Nellie Bowles writes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.</p>
