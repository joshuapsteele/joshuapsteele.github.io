        10 Things I Love About My Kids
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Lest <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/i-love-my-kids-but-i-sometimes-regret-having-them/">my previous parenting post</a> suggest that things are all doom-and-gloom at the Steele-haus, here are 10 things I love about my kids.</p>
<ol>
<li>I got to baptize all 3 of them as babies, a poignant reminder that they are beloved children of God.</li>
<li>They all love books, which warms my nerdy heart.</li>
<li>The way Eleanor (1yo) greets me. It used to be a very excited squeal. Now it’s “Ah! Daddy!”</li>
<li>Andrew (4yo) has a great memory for stories, especially Bible stories. I was redoing our fire pit, and spraying it with a hose to cut down on dust as I re-leveled the ground. Andrew: “Elijah put water on the fire, too!” (see 1 Kings 18).</li>
<li>Eva (6yo) is smart as a whip. She asks great questions, and I’m looking forward to (re-)learning with her as she gets older.</li>
<li>Eleanor’s recently learned how to do an overly-exaggerated “angry eyebrows” face, and I find it absolutely hilarious. She now does it to get a laugh.</li>
<li>Andrew loves Spiderman, and he goes back-and-forth on whether or not he thinks superheroes are real. Listening to him as he narrates Spiderman scenarios while running around in his Spiderman costume is always entertaining.</li>
<li>Eva will sometimes read books to Andrew and Eleanor. They will then imitate her–Andrew, by reciting stories from memory as he turns through the books, and Eleanor, by babbling to herself as she flips the pages.</li>
<li>I can get them all to watch things with me like This Old House, DIY videos, tool reviews, etc. Partially because they’re all curious and enjoy learning about tools. Partially (OK, mostly) because they’re thankful they’re watching *something* on the TV.</li>
<li>They’re all still young enough that they frequently want hugs and snuggles.</li>
</ol>

      <p>I love my kids, but I sometimes regret having them.</p>
<p>Pardon the clickbait-y title and opening sentence. But are we parents allowed to say that? Are we allowed to feel both of those things at once?</p>
<p>We’ve got a 6-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an almost-2-year-old. And, no, I don’t actually begrudge them their existence! I want what’s best for their lives and futures. And don’t get me wrong; <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/">there are moments of laughter, poignancy, joy, etc.</a></p>

      <p>I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.</p>
<p>Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).</p>
<p>It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.</p>

      <p>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.</p>
<p>Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!</p>
<p>But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.</p>
<p>What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?</p>
<p>What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?</p>

        Christianity and Politics: My 2024 Reading List

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election. Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.</p>
<p>(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)</p>

      <p>In the quest for personal and professional growth, understanding our unique strengths and personality traits can be incredibly enlightening. Today, I want to share my insights from various personality paradigms and how they shape my approach to work and life.</p>

        Finding a Hat for My Big, Bald Head

      <p>I’ve been on a lifelong journey to find hats that will fit my big ol’ head. Now that I’m bald, and the summer months are approaching, I figured it would be good to find one or two more hats to add to my rotation.</p>
<p>I’ve narrowed this round down to trying the following hats, in case you’re interested (Amazon affiliate links below):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TOO SMALL FOR ME</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/3xVZv3O">Carhartt Men’s Rugged Professional Series Canvas Mesh-Back Cap</a> (Shadow, One Size)</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Wi6GgS">Carhartt Men’s 100289 Odessa Ball Cap</a> (Carhartt Brown, One Size)
<ul>
<li>I’m a sucker for Carhartt and Carhartt brown!</li>
<li>This hat is comfortable</li>
<li>I like that it looks different than my other hats, which tend to be black, gray, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3UzLvWa">Ankor Ultra Performance Water-Resistant UPF 50 Baseball Hat</a> (Charcoal Gray, One Size)
<ul>
<li>Charcoal gray is my favorite color (not sure what that says about me…)</li>
<li>I really like the look and fit of this one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3xLtY4j">Flexfit Men’s Delta Seamless Cap</a> (Dark Grey, XX-Large)
<ul>
<li>Love the look and color of this</li>
<li>Very comfortable!</li>
<li>I wonder if it’s a tad *too* big for my head, though</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4aI6v2F">Flexfit Mens Cool &amp; Dry Sport</a> (Grey, X-Large-XX-Large)
<ul>
<li>This hat gets here in the mail today! I’m excited to try it out</li>

<p>O Father of mercies and God of all comfort, our only help in time of need: We humbly beseech thee to behold, visit, and relieve thy sick servant <em>N.</em> for whom our prayers are desired. Look upon <em>him</em> with the eyes of thy mercy; comfort <em>him</em> with a sense of thy goodness; preserve <em>him</em> from the temptations of the enemy; and give <em>him</em> patience under <em>his</em> affliction. In thy good time, restore <em>him</em> to health, and enable <em>him</em> to lead the residue of <em>his</em> life in thy fear, and to thy glory; and grant that finally he may dwell with thee in life everlasting; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
