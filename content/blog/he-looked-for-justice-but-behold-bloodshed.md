A lament, for a violent world in need of peace.

"O come, Desire of Nations, bind  
in one the hearts of all mankind.  
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease  
and be Thyself our King of Peace."​  

"Then Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.'"​ (Matt. 26.52)  
"And the Lord said, 'What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.'" (Gen. 4.10-11)  

"He shall judge between the nations,  
    and shall decide for many peoples;  
and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,  
    and their spears into pruning hooks;  
nation shall not lift up sword against nation,  
    neither shall they learn war any more." (Isa. 2.4)  

"For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts  
    is the house of Israel,  
and the men of Judah  
    are his pleasant planting;  
and he looked for justice,  
    but behold, bloodshed;  
for righteousness,  
    but behold, a cry!" (Isa. 5.7)  

"For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult  
    and every garment rolled in blood  
    will be burned as fuel for the fire.  
For to us a child is born,  
    to us a son is given;  
and the government will be upon his shoulder,  
    and his name will be called  
'Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,  
    Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.'" (Isa. 9.5-6)  

"Thus says the Lord: Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence to the alien, the fatherless, and the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place." (Jer. 22.3)
