Hey internet: I was recently given the chance to preach at my church, [St. Peter’s Anglican](http://stpetersbhm.org/), on the [Second Sunday of Lent](http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25). The [sermon audio is now online](http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3). If you’ve got 23 minutes to spare, [give it a listen](http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3)!

First, [here are the passages](http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25):

- Psalm 121
- Genesis 12:1-4
- Romans 4:1-5, 13-17
- John 3:1-17

Then, make sure to **ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37**[ in the audio](http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3), I departed from my notes — which ended at “Nicodemus then fades from the narrative,” (which he does in the passage at hand) — and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again. As I was quickly reminded after the service, **he does appear twice more in John’s Gospel**. Oops! Next time I’ll stick to my notes and not make any extemporaneous comments about minor characters without thinking through the context first.

Grace and Peace
