If you’ve not yet consulted the Oxford Handbook series, you should! [The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology](https://amzn.to/32MEHGy) is especially useful!

I’m very excited because [the Oxford Handbook of Dietrich Bonhoeffer](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-handbook-of-dietrich-bonhoeffer-9780198753179?cc=us&lang=en&) and [the Oxford Handbook of Karl Barth](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-handbook-of-karl-barth-9780199689781?cc=us&lang=en&) are both about to be released soon!

I just wish they weren’t so expensive!
