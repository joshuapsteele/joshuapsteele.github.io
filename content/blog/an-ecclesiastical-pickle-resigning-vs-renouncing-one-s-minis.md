It's been brought to my attention that the description of how I [resigned from ordained ministry in the Anglican Church in North America](https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/) in November 2023 might not be canonically accurate. 

## The Problem: Resigning is Renouncing?

In November 2023, here's how I put it (emphasis added to highlight the parts now in question):

> in accordance with Title III, Canon 6, Section 4 of the ACNA Canons ("Concerning Voluntary Resignation from the Ordained Ministry of this Church"), I have tendered my voluntary resignation from the ordained ministry of the Anglican Church in North America, effective on 2023-11-01.
> 
> As of 2023-11-07, my bishop and diocese have confirmed that I am a Presbyter in good standing, not under discipline as defined in Title IV of the ACNA Canons, and that my resignation is not occasioned by misconduct or irregularity, but is voluntary and for causes which do not affect my moral character.
> 
> My resignation has therefore been accepted. This means that I am released from the obligations of the Ministerial office. I relinquish the right to exercise the gifts and spiritual authority as a Minister of God's Word and Sacraments in the Anglican Church in North America.
> 
> Lastly, I'd like to clarify that **the ACNA Canons differentiate between (A) resigning from the ordained ministry of the ACNA and (B) renouncing one's Holy Orders as such.**
> 
> While I currently have no plans to pursue ordained ministry within another Christian denomination or jurisdiction, **I am solely (A) resigning from the ordained ministry in the ACNA, not (B) renouncing my Holy Orders. This distinction leaves the door ajar for potential ordained ministry elsewhere, should the Lord call me back to such in the future.**

In response to my request to resign, my Bishop and Diocese gave me a letter of good standing that read, in part (emphasis added, again, to highlight the parts now in question):

> Because of your prior and current status of “being in good standing” as a clergyperson in the Diocese of Churches for the Sake of Others (C4SO), our Executive Team (Standing Committee) has approved your request **to resign from ministerial duties while remaining in Holy Orders**. C4SO accepts your decision to relinquish the right to exercise the gifts and spiritual authority as a Minister of God's Word and Sacraments in the Anglican Church in North America. 
> 
> I confirm for all whom it may concern that you are not now, nor have ever been, under discipline and that your resignation is not due to any irregularity and casts no doubt on your moral character.

It's now being claimed that [the ACNA Canons](https://anglicanchurch.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ACNA-Constitution-and-Canons_2025.pdf) do not, in fact, differentiate between (1) resigning from the ordained ministry of the ACNA and (2) renouncing one's Holy Orders as such. That those are, in fact, the same thing.

Put differently, the argument is that the phrase "resignation or renunciation of the [ordained] ministry," which occurs four times in the Canons **does not describe two different ways of leaving ministry, but the one way of leaving ministry**.

## The Canon in Question

Here's the full text of the canon in question. Let me know how you interpret it.

{{< callout "note" >}}
TITLE III: Of Ministers, Their Recruitment, Preparation, Ordination, Office, Practice and Transfer

Canon 6: Of the Acceptance and Dismissal of Clergy in this Church

Section 3: Concerning Voluntary Resignation from the Ordained Ministry of this Church

1. Any Deacon or Presbyter in good standing may resign from the Ordained Ministry of this Church by sending a resignation in writing to the Bishop with jurisdiction. The Bishop or other Ecclesiastical Authority shall record the declaration and request so made, and shall determine that the Deacon or Presbyter is not under discipline as defined in Title IV of these canons, and that the resignation is not occasioned by misconduct or irregularity, but is voluntary and for causes which do not affect the moral character of the Deacon or Presbyter. Upon making this determination, the Bishop or other Ecclesiastical Authority shall defer formal action upon the declaration for two months, and meanwhile shall lay the matter before the Standing Committee or its equivalent for advice and consent. With its advice and consent, the Bishop or other Ecclesiastical Authority may pronounce that such resignation is accepted and that the Deacon or Presbyter is released from the obligations of the Ministerial office, and that the Deacon or Presbyter relinquishes the right to exercise in this Church the gifts and spiritual authority as a Minister of God's Word and Sacraments conferred in ordination.
2. The Bishop's declaration shall state that the resignation was for causes which do not affect the Deacon or Presbyter's moral character, and shall, if requested, give a certificate to this effect to the person so removed from the ministry of this Church. In all other cases of resignation or renunciation of the ordained ministry, where there may be a question of misconduct or irregularity, the Bishop shall follow the procedures outlined in Canon IV.7.
3. Any Deacon or Presbyter whose resignation has been accepted under this canon may request that the Bishop write a commendatory letter to another Christian denomination or jurisdiction.
4. A Deacon or Presbyter having voluntarily resigned from the ordained ministry of this Church and not under the discipline of any ecclesial body may petition the Bishop having jurisdiction in the diocese from which the Deacon or Presbyter resigned to restore the right to exercise in this Church the gifts and spiritual authority as a Minister of God's Word and Sacraments conferred in ordination. The terms and conditions of such restoration shall be entirely within the discretion of the Bishop having jurisdiction in the diocese from which the Deacon or Presbyter resigned, with the advice and consent of the Standing Committee or its equivalent.

## My Options

If resigning and renouncing are one and the same, then my options are:

1. Stay connected to a bishop in the ACNA,
2. Ask to transfer my ordination elsewhere, or
3. Resign/renounce ordained ministry (dropping the "not renouncing my Holy Orders" from my request and "while remaining in Holy Orders" from my bishop's response)

I'm still trying to think through things before making a decision. I don't want to do 1. I don't think I'm ready to do 2. And, until today, I didn't think I was ready to do 3.

What are your thoughts? Any counsel you'd offer? Any specific questions I should consider as I weigh my options? Let me know.
