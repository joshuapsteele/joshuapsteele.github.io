title: What I'm Reading this Fall

This upcoming semester, I’ll be taking a seminar on the Doctrine of Creation from my supervisor Marc Cortez. I’ll also be doing my “pedagogical experience” in a Christian Theology course—also with Marc Cortez.

Anyways, in case you’re interested, I thought I’d share what I’ll be reading for each course.

Have you read any of these works? If so, what did you think? What will *you* be reading this semester?
