The following statements should not be controversial, but they sadly are. What would you add to this list?

Donald Trump lost the 2020 election.

January 6th, 2021, was an insurrection.

Congress, not the President (and much less the President's unelected adviser), holds the power of the purse.

The Judicial branch, and not the Executive branch, interprets the law and the Constitution.

No one, not even the President, is above the law.

DOGE is not an official, legal government agency.

Elon Musk is not the President of the United States.

Elon Musk has not been elected to any public office.

Elon Musk personally benefits from many government contracts, and should not be making spending decisions for the government.

Executive orders are not laws.

Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine did not start the war with Russia.

The United States of America is a democratic republic, not a dictatorship.

The United States of America is a secular nation, not a theocracy.

The United States of America is a country, not a corporation.
