You’ll notice that [the previous post on Cedarville](https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/) ends with a link to [the Course Schedule](http://www.cedarville.edu/courses/schedule/2014fa_bi_beth.htm):

“Class Limited to Women” … I know, ludicrous. Especially considering Joy Fagan’s previous track record of making the first class, Scriptural Interpretation of Gender Issues (or SIGI), a truly excellent course by all accounts from former students, male and female.

Equally ludicrous? The [textbook choices](http://cedarville.verbacompare.com/compare/1?src=2&type=2&stoid=10&trm=FALL%2014&cid=2014_4144)! Are you ready for what CU students will be reading to form an even-handed perspective of what the Bible has to say on gender? Maybe some [Miroslav Volf](https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/11/10/volf-on-gender/)? [“Junia is Not Alone” by Scot McKnight](http://www.amazon.com/Junia-Not-Alone-Scot-McKnight-ebook/dp/B006H4PFZ8)? NOPE.

Words fail.

Cedarville, get your act together. Prospective students, stay far away until the institution recovers it’s broad evangelical vision (the one carried forward by Bill Brown and Carl Ruby, for example). Unfortunately, it appears that vision has been thoroughly squashed in the conservative takeover.
