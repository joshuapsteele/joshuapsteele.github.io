For the past few years, I've loosely followed [the "Bullet Journal" method of note-taking](https://bulletjournal.com/). Usually in a [Leuchtturm1917 Hardcover A5 notebook with dotted pages](https://amzn.to/4aiTbCs) (the best!).

Whenever I finish one notebook and start another, among other things, I like to write down some key questions and mental models at the front of the new notebook, so that I can easily refer back to them whenever I need to. 

Here's what I've written at the start of my current notebook.

## Ivy Lee Method

1. Write down the 6 most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow. (No more than 6!)
2. Prioritize those 6 items in order of their true importance.
3. Tomorrow, focus on the first task until it is completed before moving on to the second task, and so on.
4. At the end of the day, move any unfinished items to a new list of 6 tasks for the following day.

Repeat! **Do the most important things first.**
