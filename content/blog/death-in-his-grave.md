With Holy Week and Easter coming up, I’ve been thinking about music and artwork that I’ve found particularly poignant when reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.

First, I’ve seen many icons of the resurrection (“anastasis,” in Greek) like the one below.

But I don’t think I fully appreciated the image until I realized it was Adam and Eve that Christ is helping up out of their graves. He’s trampled down the doors/gates of Hell and is taking an elderly Adam and an elderly Eve by the hand. Rescuing them from the realm of Death, in order to bring them back to eternal life with God.

Second, I’ve long appreciated “Death in His Grave” by John Mark McMillan as a reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.

By John Mark McMillan

Though the Earth Cried out for blood  
Satisfied her hunger was  
Her billows calmed on raging seas  
For the souls on men she craved

Sun and moon from balcony  
Turned their head in disbelief  
Their precious Love would taste the sting  
Disfigured and disdained

On Friday a thief  
On Sunday a King  
Laid down in grief  
But awoke with keys  
Of Hell on that day  
The first born of the slain  
The Man Jesus Christ  
Laid death in his grave

So three days in darkness slept  
The Morning Sun of righteousness  
But rose to shame the throes of death  
And over turn his rule

Now daughters and the sons of men  
Would pay not their dues again  
The debt of blood they owed was rent  
When the day rolled a new

On Friday a thief  
On Sunday a King  
Laid down in grief  
But awoke holding keys  
To Hell on that day  
The first born of the slain  
The Man Jesus Christ  
Laid death in his grave

On Friday a thief  
On Sunday a King  
Laid down in grief  
But awoke with keys  
Of Hell on that day  
The first born of the slain  
The Man Jesus Christ  
Laid death in his grave

He has cheated  
Hell and seated  
Us above the fall  
In desperate places  
He paid our wages  
One time once and for all
