excerpt: Almighty God, you rescued your people from slavery in Egypt, and throughout
  the ages you have never failed to hear the cries of the captives; We remember before
  you our sisters and brothers in Galveston, Texas who on this day received the glad
  tidings of their emancipation; Forgive us for the many grave sins that delayed that
  liberating word

The following is a “collect” prayer that I composed for Juneteenth in 2020. What’s a “collect” prayer?

> The short form of prayer, constructed (with many varieties of detail) from (1) an invocation, (2) a petition, and (3) a pleading of Christ’s name or an ascription of glory to God; and one of the most characteristic items in the W\[estern\] liturgy.

For more on Juneteenth, see [“The Historical Legacy of Juneteenth” (National Museum of African American History and Culture)](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/historical-legacy-juneteenth).

Here’s the prayer. Please feel free to use and share!

> Almighty God, you rescued your people from slavery in Egypt, and throughout the ages you have never failed to hear the cries of the captives; We remember before you our sisters and brothers in Galveston, Texas who on this day received the glad tidings of their emancipation; Forgive us for the many grave sins that delayed that liberating word; Anoint us with your Spirit to bring good news to the poor, to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, and to proclaim the year of your favor; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
