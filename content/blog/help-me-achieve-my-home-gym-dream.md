I’m trying to put together a basic home gym in our basement apartment. Mainly, I’m interested in doing squats for now. Then, I’ll expand to deadlifts and benchpress. Our ceilings are too low for overhead presses, however.

Anyways, I just ordered the Valor Fitness BD-9 squat rack from Amazon.

I still need a decent Olympic bar and Olympic plates.
