Since buying our first house about a year ago, I've gotten really into DIY home repair, home improvement, etc. As a software engineer, I find that working with physical tools on physical problems is a refreshing change of pace after staring at a screen all day!

Plus, it's an excuse to buy a bunch of tools!

Speaking of tools, I've been thinking about diagnostic tools that would be helpful for a homeowner to own. Here's a list of the ones I own, organized roughly in order of importance.

- Smoke detectors (I got mine from [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Electrical-Fire-Safety-Smoke-Detectors/N-5yc1vZbmh8), Kidde brand)
- Carbon monoxide detectors (I got mine from [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Electrical-Fire-Safety-Carbon-Monoxide-Detectors/N-5yc1vZbmgk), Kidde brand)
- Non-contact voltage tester ([this one from Klein Tools](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Electrical-Fire-Safety-Carbon-Monoxide-Detectors/N-5yc1vZbmgk))
- Wall scanner / stud finder (like [this one](https://amzn.to/40AwR3P))
- Measuring tools 
    - [measuring tape](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Stanley-25-ft-PowerLock-Tape-Measure-33-425D/100019154)
