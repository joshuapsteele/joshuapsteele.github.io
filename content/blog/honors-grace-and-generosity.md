Yahweh and others have been too good to me.

Today I received two awards at Cedarville University’s [49th Annual Academic Honors Day Chapel](http://www.cedarville.edu/cf/calendar/viewsingleevent/id/b30deaf6-2481-ade4-b080-a503cd1527b2).

The first: The Oxford University Press Award in Preseminary Bible, given to the graduating senior with the highest cumulative GPA in the preseminary major.

The second: [The Daniel Award.](http://www.cedarville.edu/financialaid/Daniel+Award)

“Established in 2001 by David and Jean Heyd, this endowed award was created to honor their parents, Charles and E. LaRue Wilcox and Elmer and Kathy Heyd. The scholarship assists a graduating full-time male senior student who has been accepted by a conservative evangelical seminary. The recipient must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3, demonstrate the spiritual qualifications and godly leadership skills necessary to excel in this ministry, and plan to serve as full-time pastor of a church. \[…\] The Department of Biblical and Ministry Studies faculty select the recipients.”

The first award got me a copy of [The Contemporary Parallel New Testament](http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Bibles/ParallelTextBibles/NewInternationalVersion/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5NTI4MTM2MQ==) (edited by Kohlenberger, III). The second award? $5,000 toward my seminary education. Barring any significant price hikes, that should cover the remainder of my tuition at [Beeson Divinity School](http://www.beesondivinity.com/) for the next 3.5 years!

Despite my standing critiques of Cedarville University, I must admit that my life would look radically different today had I not arrived here four years ago.

As I look forward to the next stage of my life, I’m realizing more and more how much my life each day depends on the grace and generosity of others. I’m extremely thankful for the opportunities – even the painful ones – I’ve been given to live, learn, and grow at Cedarville. I never would have imagined meeting so many [wonderful](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelpahl/), [Christlike](http://www.carlruby.com/), and challenging people in the middle of cornfields in Southwest Ohio.

I’m thankful that God’s Kingdom transcends Cedarville,  
but also that I’ve gotten to glimpse the Kingdom here.

Grace and Peace,

~Josh
