I bought my first 3 guns for a combination of recreation and home defense:

- Rifle: Ruger 10/22 Carbine w/3-9x40 Scope, .22LR
- Shotgun: Mossberg Maverick 88 Security, 12ga
- Handgun: Taurus G3C, 9mm Luger

Looking forward to practicing with the 10/22 and the handgun at a local indoor range. And I might see about doing some clay target shooting outdoors if/when we get some nice weather.

(For what it's worth, I am willing to use lethal force against someone who breaks into my house and demonstrates intent to use lethal force against my family. But I would make no theological or religious justifications for doing so.)
