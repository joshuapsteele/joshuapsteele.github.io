I [recently wrote](https://joshuapsteele.com/whats-gone-wrong-with-the-digital-karl-barth-library/) about a problem I found in [Alexander Street Press’](https://alexanderstreet.com/) [Digital Karl Barth Library](https://alexanderstreet.com/products/digital-karl-barth-library): the Scripture citation search function no longer worked!

I’m happy to report that, though the DKBL is still far from user-friendly, the Bible search *works* again!

Now we just need some angel investors and programmers to produce a user-friendly version of the Digital Karl Barth Library! 🙂 Any takers?
