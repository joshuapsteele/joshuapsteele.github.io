## INTRODUCTION: THE NATURE OF SCRIPTURE

As the [illocutionary act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illocutionary_act) which testifies to the Son of God[^1] as the ultimate redemptive and revelatory [locution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locutionary_act) of the the triune God, Scripture is used by the Spirit of God to accomplish the [perlocutionary end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlocutionary_act) of redemption *of*, *in*, and *through* the people of God.[^2]

*[Ahem, in order to understand my first paragraph, you must first be familiar with the basics of [Speech Act Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act). If you've never heard of it before, click that link, and then come back here. It will be worth it, I promise!]*

The written Word of God is, therefore, the authority for followers of the living Word of God precisely because of its providential role in the divine speech-act, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.[^3]

Practically, this providential role has worked itself out in various ways throughout the history of the Church, perhaps most notably through the development of canon in the patristic era.

Theologically, the authority of Scripture is inescapably **trinitarian** in nature and **ecclesiological** in implication.

## WHAT SCRIPTURE IS FOR CHRISTIANS

For Christians, Scripture is the indispensable lens through which, with the Spirit's illumination, we view Christ, who is himself the fullest lens through which we view the Godhead.

That is, the Bible is a vital link in the revelatory chain which includes Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and humanity. However, the Bible's role *in* and *for* the Church is inescapably intertwined with (1) how the Bible came to be and (2) how it is properly to be accessed and interpreted.

## How the Bible Came to Be

Although the story of how the table of contents at the beginning of each Christian Bible came into existence is an old one, questions of *canon* in this sense did not arise immediately after Christ's resurrection and ascension.[^4]

The earliest Christians, persuaded that Jesus of Nazareth was the foretold Messiah of Israel, eagerly adopted the Hebrew Scriptures, or *Tanakh*, as their own Scripture. Apart from the Bible's narrative of YHWH's redemptive mission with his covenant people, the Christ-event (life, death, and resurrection) made little sense.

In the other direction, however, the early Church believed that, as the fulfillment of the *Tanakh*, Christ himself was its true message. Put differently, the Hebrew Scriptures and the Son of God were considered reciprocally-interpretive, and this relationship was the first sense in which canon was considered as "the rule of truth": the Christ-event and the Scriptures illuminate each other.[^5]

The link between this earliest consideration of canon and the table-of-contents approach begins with the role proclamation and confession of the Son of God as the Bible's true meaning – of the Gospel of Christ *according to the Scriptures* – have in creating the Church proper (cf. 1 Cor. 15:1-9).[^6]

Because Christians are primarily interested in bringing people to faith in the faithful God through Christ, the proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Word of God constitutes the Church as the divinely-ordained way in which faith is brought about (cf. Rom. 10:17). To use a spatial metaphor, this ecclesial "point" of proclamation becomes a "line" throughout history by *tradition* as "the act of passing down" and "the content of what is passed down."[^7]

The Church is thus formed by proclamation/confession of Jesus the Messiah according to the Scriptures, and preserved by tradition.

In the second century C.E., Irenaeus of Lyons relied upon the connection between Scripture and apostolic tradition to refute Gnostic heresies which threatened to destabilize the Christian community by, among other things, insisting that Scripture could not be read at face value.[^8]

This connection was so strong that he referred to the "traditioned" teachings of the apostles as *in scripturis*, responding to those who accused these apostolic "Writings" of novel fiction by delineating the unity of Christian doctrine which had been passed down from the apostles (eyewitnesses of the Christ-event) to the Church through a clear line of bishops.[^9]

It was of crucial importance to Irenaeus that Christian doctrine was (1) unified and (2) in direct continuity with the apostles' teaching (and therefore with the proclamation of Christ and the Christologically-fulfilled expectations of the Hebrew Scriptures).[^10]

Thus the Gnostic controversies of the second century led to canonization in its second sense: the Church's recognition/acknowledgment of writings which already had authority due to their coherence with the complex dialectic between Scripture, the Christ-event, the apostles, proclamation, and tradition.[^11]

Canon's final sense, as a list of included and excluded books which comprise the Bible, came into being in the fourth century. The Church's recognition of already authoritative writings culminated in C.E. 367 with the *Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle* of Athanasius – the first canon list to include "all, and nothing but, all [sic] the books of our New Testament."[^12]

## Scripture's Proper Interpretation and Role

In interacting with the Word of God, it is imperative that the people of God resist the impulse to jump behind the text – either to a Gnostic-inspired and disembodied spiritual narrative, or to historical criticism's rationalistic insistence on verifiable facts.

Properly handled, the Bible results in the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in order to produce faith in the faithful God.

Arguably, the best interpretive method accounts for both Christ as the fullest truth of Scripture and the varied ways in which the Bible has been used by God through his Spirit to accomplish his redemptive mission in manifold ways.

That is, in terms of my thesis above, the best biblical hermeneutic accounts for both the central locution (Christ) and the varied perlocutionary effects accomplished in/through the Church by the Spirit throughout history.

It does not leave Christ behind in its insistence on esoteric behind-the-text matters, nor does it refuse the Spirit its right to bring the written Word to bear on the interpreter's present context in fresh ways. In this way, interpretation of the Bible leads to faith through the faithful proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Scriptures.

# SCRIPTURE'S OWN AUTHORITY

As mentioned above, Scripture's authority comes from its providential role in the speech-act of God, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.

That is, although the illocutionary acts of the Bible are an indispensable link in the revelatory chain, they do not comprise the entire chain. Any discussion of Scripture's authority must, therefore, take place with its discursive context in mind, by including a discussion of the Christological locution and Spirit-empowered, ecclesiological perlocutionary effects of the divine speech-act.

Christologically, the illocutionary acts of the written Word of God bear witness to Christ the living Word as their central meaning: the ultimate locution of God.

[^1]: Unless otherwise noted, I use the terms "Son of God," "Jesus," "Christ/Messiah," and permutations thereof interchangeably. The same applies to "Scripture" and "Bible."

[^2]: I here adopt J.L. Austin's speech-act theory, as put forth in How to Do Things with Words (2nd ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975). Briggs offers the following helpful summary: "Austin sought to distinguish between the act performed in saying something and the act performed by saying something, labeling these 'illocutionary' and 'perlocutionary' acts respectively." See Richard S. Briggs, "Speech-Act Theory" in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 763. I am also heavily indebted to Kevin J. Vanhoozer, "Word of God" in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 850-4.

[^3]: Theologically modifying Austin's framework, the "divine speech-act" consists of God the Father (locutor), God the Son (locution), Scripture (illocutionary act), and God the Spirit (who fulfills the perlocutionary effects).
