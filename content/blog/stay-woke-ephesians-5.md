With fascism on the rise in the United States of America and around the world, and with many so-called "Christians" gladly supporting the rise of the far-right and attributing it to the will of God, I was struck by these words from Ephesians 5 (which were assigned as one of the readings for Morning Prayer today).

Ephesians 5:11-14 (New Living Translation, NLT)

> 11 Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.  
> 12 It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret.  
> 13 But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, 14 for the light makes everything visible.  
> This is why it is said,  
>  
> “Awake, O sleeper,  
>     rise up from the dead,  
>     and Christ will give you light.”  

What are these "worthless deeds of evil"? From the beginning of Ephesians 5:

> 3 Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God’s people.  
> 4 Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes—these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God.  
> 5 You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God.  
> For a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.

No doubt those who support the rise of the far-right would claim that they are not guilty of these things, but that they are themselves exposing the "unfruitful works of darkness" committed by those on the godless left!

I'm not so sure. 

Of course, left-leaning political parties and movements are not without their own faults. But I think that the far greater danger within the church is that the far-right promise of political power and influence (and retribution against perceived enemies) has caused many to abandon the gospel of Jesus Christ in favor of a false gospel that is more concerned with power than with love, mercy, and justice.

Greed is idolatry.

Let judgment begin with the household of God. And may God have mercy on us all.
