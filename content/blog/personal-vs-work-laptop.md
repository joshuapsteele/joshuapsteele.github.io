How does your personal machine compare to your work laptop? If you were going to get a new personal computer/laptop today, what would you go with? 

Just curious as I consider replacing my aging 2016 MacBook Pro as my personal laptop (especially since [costs might go up soon for electronics, due to tariffs](https://www.wired.com/story/tariffs-are-going-to-make-your-electronics-more-expensive/)). 

For work, I've got a 2019 MacBook Pro. More details below:

- Personal machine: 2016 MacBook Pro 
    - 13-inch 
    - 2 Thunderbolt ports
    - 2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 processor
    - 16 GB memory
    - 250 GB storage
- Work machine: 2019 MacBook Pro
    - 16-inch
    - 4 Thunderbolt ports
    - 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 processor
    - 32 GB memory
    - 500 GB storage

Essentially, I'm thinking of a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro. Not quite sure which specs to go with. I don't need crazy capabilities at this time for personal hacking/development, but I'd like to be able to build and run stuff locally using stuff like LangGraph to build AI tools.
