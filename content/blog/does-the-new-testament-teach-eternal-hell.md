Most Christians assume that the New Testament clearly and consistently teaches eternal conscious torment in hell. But when you actually go looking for this doctrine in the text, the picture becomes far more complicated than you might expect.

On one hand, you have a handful of passages that seem to teach eternal punishment. On the other hand, you have a remarkable number of passages that appear to promise the salvation of all people. And when you examine the Greek words involved, the case for eternal torment becomes even less certain.

David Bentley Hart puts it well in *That All Shall Be Saved: Heaven, Hell, and Universal Salvation* (pp. 93-95):

> There is a general sense among most Christians that the notion of an eternal hell is explicitly and unremittingly advanced in the New Testament; and yet, when we go looking for it in the actual pages of the text, it proves remarkably elusive. The whole idea is, for instance, entirely absent from the Pauline corpus, as even the thinnest shadow of a hint. Nor is it anywhere patently present in any of the other epistolary texts. There is one verse in the gospels, Matthew 25:46, that—at least, as traditionally understood—offers what seems the strongest evidence for the idea (though even there, as I shall explain below, the wording leaves room for considerable doubt regarding its true significance); and then there are perhaps a couple verses from Revelation (though, as ever when dealing with that particular book, *caveat lector*). Beyond that, nothing is clear. What in fact the New Testament provides us with are a number of fragmentary and fantastic images that can be taken in any number of ways, arranged according to our prejudices and expectations, and declared literal or figural or hyperbolic as our desires dictate. True, Jesus speaks of a final judgment, and uses many metaphors to describe the unhappy lot of the condemned. Many of these are metaphors of destruction, like the annihilation of chaff or brambles in ovens, or the final death of body and soul in the Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna). Others are metaphors of exclusion, like the sealed doors of wedding feasts. A few, a very few, are images of imprisonment and torture; but, even then, in the relevant verses, those punishments are depicted as having only a limited term (Matthew 5:26; 18:34; Luke 12:47-48, 59). Nowhere is there any description of a kingdom of perpetual cruelty presided over by Satan, as though he were a kind of chthonian god.

> On the other hand, however, there are a remarkable number of passages in the New Testament, several of them from Paul's writings, that appear instead to promise a final salvation of all persons and all things, and in the most unqualified terms. I imagine some or most of these latter could be explained away as rhetorical exaggeration; but then, presumably, the same could be said of those verses that appear to presage an everlasting division between the redeemed and the reprobate. To me it is surpassingly strange that, down the centuries, most Christians have come to believe that one class of claims—all of which are allegorical, pictorial, vague, and metaphorical in form—must be regarded as providing the "literal" content of the New Testament's teaching regarding the world to come, while another class—all of which are invariably straightforward doctrinal statements—must be regarded as mere hyperbole. It is one of the great mysteries of Christian history (or perhaps of a certain kind of religious psychopathology). And it is certainly curious also that so many Christians are able to recognize that the language of scripture is full of metaphor, on just about every page, and yet fail to notice that, when it comes to descriptions of the world to come, there are no non-metaphorical images at all. Why precisely this should be I cannot say. We can see that the ovens are metaphors, and the wheat and the chaff, and the angelic harvest, and the barred doors, and the debtors' prisons; so why do we not also recognize that the deathless worm and the inextinguishable fire and all other such images (none of which, again, means quite what the infernalist imagines) are themselves mere figural devices within the embrace of an extravagant apocalyptic imagery that, in itself, has no strictly literal elements? How did some images become *mere* images in the general Christian imagination while others became exact documentary portraits of some final reality? If one can be swayed simply by the brute force of arithmetic, it seems worth noting that, among the apparently most explicit statements on the last things, the universalist statements are by far the more numerous.

## Passages That Seem to Teach Universal Salvation

Hart goes on to list passages that appear to promise salvation for all. Here they are in the NASB translation:

### Romans 5:18-19

> So then, as through one offense the result was condemnation to all mankind, so also through one act of righteousness the result was justification of life to all mankind. For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.

### 1 Corinthians 15:22

> For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.

### 2 Corinthians 5:14

> For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died;

### Romans 11:32

> For God has shut up all in disobedience, so that He may show mercy to all.

### 1 Timothy 2:3-6

> This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and mankind, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.

### Titus 2:11

> For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people.

### 2 Corinthians 5:19

> Namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their wrongdoings against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.

### Ephesians 1:9-10

> He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He set forth in Him, regarding His plan of the fullness of the times, to bring all things together in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth.

### Colossians 1:27-28

> To whom God willed to make known what the wealth of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles is, the mystery that is Christ in you, the hope of glory. We proclaim Him, admonishing every person and teaching every person with all wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in Christ.

### John 12:32

> And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself.

### Hebrews 2:9

> But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of His suffering death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.

### John 17:2

> Just as You gave Him authority over all mankind, so that to all whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life.

### John 4:42

> And they were saying to the woman, "It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One truly is the Savior of the world."

### John 12:47

> If anyone hears My teachings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.

### 1 John 4:14

> We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.

### 2 Peter 3:9

> The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.

### Matthew 18:14

> So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.

### Philippians 2:9-11

> For this reason also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

### Colossians 1:19-20

> For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him, and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.

### 1 John 2:2

> And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

### John 3:17

> For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.

### Luke 16:16

> The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John came; since that time the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.

Hart notes that the Greek word *biazetai* here could also be translated "is being forced into" the kingdom.

### 1 Timothy 4:10

> For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all mankind, especially of believers.

Hart follows this list with a discussion of what "especially" (*malista*) could mean in this context. If God is the Savior of all, but "especially" of believers, what does that imply about non-believers?

## Passages That Seem to Teach Eternal Punishment

Now for the other side. These are the passages most often cited as teaching eternal conscious torment.

### Matthew 25:46 (The Sheep and the Goats)

> These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.

**Universalist interpretation:** This verse hinges on two Greek words. First, *aionios* (translated "eternal") derives from *aion* (age/eon) and can mean "pertaining to an age" rather than "everlasting." Greek had an unambiguous word for eternal (*aïdios*), which the New Testament uses only twice and never for punishment. Second, the word for "punishment" (*kolasis*) originally meant "pruning" and in classical Greek denoted corrective punishment aimed at reformation. Aristotle distinguished it from *timoria* (retributive punishment): "*Kolasis* is for the sake of the one who suffers it." Hart translates this verse as "the chastening of that Age," suggesting age-long corrective punishment rather than endless retribution.

### Luke 16:23-26 (The Rich Man and Lazarus)

> And in Hades he raised his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his arms. And he cried out and said, "Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame." But Abraham said, "Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set, so that those who want to go over from here to you will not be able, nor will any people cross over from there to us."

**Universalist interpretation:** Both characters are in Hades (the realm of the dead), not the final state. This matches Jewish cosmology of the time, where Hades had separate regions for righteous and unrighteous, all awaiting final judgment. The parable adapts a common Mediterranean folktale type (also found in Egyptian and rabbinic sources), and its point concerns listening to Moses and the prophets, not afterlife geography. The "great chasm" is impassable by human effort, but after Christ's death and resurrection, Ephesians 4:8-9 declares that Christ "descended into the lower regions" and "led captives." What humans cannot cross, God can bridge.

### Revelation 14:9-11

> Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."

**Universalist interpretation:** Revelation is apocalyptic literature saturated with symbolic imagery. The phrase "smoke ascending forever" echoes Isaiah 34:10, which describes Edom's destruction: "Its smoke shall go up forever." Edom is no longer burning. John draws on prophetic hyperbole, not literal description. The Greek word for "tormented" (*basanizo*) derives from *basanos*, the touchstone used to test gold's purity, suggesting purification rather than mere punishment. Sulfur (brimstone) was used in ancient metallurgy to purify precious metals.

### Revelation 20:10-15

> And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them; and they were judged, each one of them according to their deeds. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

**Universalist interpretation:** Death and Hades themselves are thrown into the lake of fire. Abstract concepts cannot literally burn, indicating symbolic meaning. Robin Parry notes that the same nations under judgment earlier in Revelation later appear bringing glory into the New Jerusalem (21:24, 26), and the tree of life bears leaves "for the healing of the nations" (22:2). Most strikingly, the New Jerusalem's gates "shall never be shut" (21:25). Open gates only matter if traffic uses them. Since no one would leave paradise, the gates must welcome incoming traffic. After 20:15 describes people cast into the lake of fire, 21:6 uses future tense: "I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost." The invitation remains open.

## Conclusion

I'm not suggesting these questions are simple. But I am suggesting that the New Testament's teaching on final judgment is far more complex than I was led to believe growing up. The passages that seem to promise universal salvation are, as Hart notes, "by far the more numerous" and tend to be straightforward doctrinal statements. The passages that seem to teach eternal punishment are few and come wrapped in metaphorical, apocalyptic imagery.

At minimum, this should give us pause before we confidently proclaim that the Bible clearly teaches eternal conscious torment. It should make us ask why we've tended to read the metaphorical passages literally and the straightforward passages as hyperbole.

And it might open us to the possibility that God's patience and love really do extend further than we've been taught to imagine.
