I’m working my way through the classic job search guide *[What Color Is Your Parachute](https://amzn.to/3O8cnYK)*. First, I’ll summarize the 7-part “Flower Petal” exercise—a comprehensive self-assessment geared toward the workplace. Then, I’ll share \*my\* results from the self-assessment.

Ah, but first, my **TL;DR**: **If you’re looking for work, or going to be looking for work soon, do yourself a huge favor and buy the latest edition of *[What Color Is Your Parachute](https://amzn.to/3O8cnYK)*.** Work through the book, especially the Flower Petal Exercise. It’s well-worth your time!

## The Flower Petal Exercise

The Flower Petal Exercise is a self-discovery tool designed to help individuals identify their career objectives and life goals. Using a visual analogy of a flower, it engages users in an interactive exploration of their skills, interests, values, and professional aspirations.

The ‘flower’ consists of seven ‘petals’ or components, each representing a different aspect of a person’s work-life:

1. **People Environments**: Here, you define the type of people you enjoy working with. Consider factors such as company culture, team size, or the sociopolitical views of your colleagues.
2. **Working Conditions**: This focuses on the conditions under which you perform best. It may include factors like flexible working hours, remote work, office settings, or your preference for a structured versus unstructured work environment.
3. **Transferable Skills**: These are skills you’ve acquired over time that can be transferred across various roles and industries. For instance, project management, problem-solving, or leadership skills.
4. **Fields of Knowledge**: This petal captures specific knowledge areas you’re interested in or have a deep understanding of. This could be anything from technology to psychology or even history.
5. **Level of Responsibility**: This petal evaluates your desire for responsibility. Are you seeking a leadership role, or do you prefer a supportive, team member role?
6. **Salary and Level of Lifestyle**: Here you outline your financial goals and the lifestyle you aim for. It includes considerations like desired salary, job benefits, and work-life balance.
7. **Values and Goals**: This final petal is about your personal values and life goals, aligning your career with your moral compass and long-term aspirations.

Each petal is equally important, and the final image should give you a holistic view of your career preferences and strengths. The objective of the Flower Petal Exercise is to help you understand yourself better, providing a clear vision of your career path and enabling you to make more informed decisions in your professional life.

It is important to remember that the exercise is not a one-time thing. Your ‘flower’ is expected to change and evolve as you grow, learn, and experience more in your life and career.
