Getting Things Done ("GTD" for short) is a widely popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as [Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017](https://lifehacker.com/getting-things-done-ten-years-in-1795707084), "You don‚Äôt hear a lot of people talk about the [*Getting Things Done*](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) productivity system anymore."

I think that‚Äôs a shame because it‚Äôs a very effective system.

I first tried Getting Things Done after reading "[What‚Äôs Best Next](http://amzn.to/2tMiX1w)" by Matt Perman and then reading "[Getting Things Done](http://amzn.to/2HvNJxv)" by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.

At its core, GTD revolves around the following idea from David Allen:

> ‚ÄúYour mind is for having ideas, not holding them.‚Äù

What does that mean? Well, your brain does a much better job of coming up with random things than keeping track of them. Therefore, if you don‚Äôt have a system in place for reliably and comprehensively keeping track of all the random ‚Äúopen loops‚Äù your brain comes up with throughout the day, you will use up a lot of your mental bandwidth trying to remember everything instead of acting on them.

Enter the GTD system. It‚Äôs designed to solve the problem of tracking the ‚Äúopen loops‚Äù your brain creates‚Äîwhether "I need to buy milk" or "I need to revamp my blog."

## The "Pillars" of GTD

1. **Capture**: Think on paper. Get stuff out of your head and into a list.
2. **Clarify**: Decide whether each item is an action, a project, something to delete, defer, or delegate, etc. [GTD Workflow Chart](https://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf).
3. **Organize**: As you clarify, put things into different ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù ‚Äì Action Lists, Project Lists, Someday/Maybe Lists, Waiting For Lists, Reference Materials, etc.
4. **Review**: Look at your buckets regularly‚Äîdaily and weekly.
5. **Engage**: You know, get stuff done.

## Getting Back on the GTD Bandwagon

Unfortunately, after following GTD for a few years, I ‚Äúfell off the bandwagon.‚Äù I got sloppy with capturing and clarifying my ‚Äúopen loops,‚Äù leading to more time worrying about what I had to do instead of reviewing my "Next Action" lists and moving forward, GTD-style.

Just this past week, I decided to get back on the GTD bandwagon. I‚Äôve got a Ph.D. dissertation to write and a baby on the way, after all! There‚Äôs no time to spend worrying about things I‚Äôm forgetting. üôÇ

## My GTD Tools

### [ToDoist](https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/203799792-Getting-Things-Done-GTD-with-Todoist)

ToDoist is a fantastic task manager that I use to keep track of my personal tasks and projects.

### [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)

I use Google Calendar for managing my schedule‚Äîpretty straightforward. üôÇ

### [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)

For email communication, I use Gmail along with [Unroll.Me](https://unroll.me/) and [Boomerang](https://www.boomeranggmail.com/), both of which I highly recommend. I have three simple folders:

- **@ACTION_SUPPORT**
- **@KEEP**
- **@WAITING_FOR_SUPPORT**

When an email requires action, I place it in the **@ACTION_SUPPORT** folder and create a task in ToDoist to remind me. If it's a reference email, I archive it or move it to the **@KEEP** folder. For emails I‚Äôm waiting on others to act, I set a follow-up reminder in ToDoist and move it to **@WAITING_FOR_SUPPORT**.

### [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)

Evernote is my second brain‚Äîmy reference system for everything from receipts to class notes.

### [Leuchtturm1917 Medium Size Hardcover A5 Notebook ‚Äì Dotted Grid](http://amzn.to/2FG5Ccu)

This is my go-to tool for "capturing" ideas, projects, actions, etc.
