For my “Pedagogical Experience” requirement at Wheaton, I’m helping to teach a masters-level Christian Theology course.

Yesterday, I got to teach a lesson on justification and sanctification. A lot to cover in a 95-minute class session!

If you’re interested in what I covered, here are my slides (in PDF format).
