For my “Pedagogical Experience” requirement at Wheaton, I’m helping to teach a masters-level Christian Theology course.

Yesterday, I got to teach a lesson on justification and sanctification. A lot to cover in a 95-minute class session!

If you're interested in what I covered, here are my slides: [Justification and Sanctification Slides (PDF)](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/19.-Justification-and-Sanctification.pdf)

And here is the handout: [Justification and Sanctification Handout (Word)](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/19.-Justification-and-Sanctification.docx)
