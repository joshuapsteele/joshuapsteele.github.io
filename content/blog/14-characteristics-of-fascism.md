Let's try to define (or at least describe) fascism, shall we? 

> Fascism: "a populist political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual, that is associated with a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, and that is characterized by severe economic and social regimentation and by forcible suppression of opposition" (Merriam-Webster)

Notoriously difficult to define, [Umberto Eco nevertheless highlighted 14 aspects of what he called "Ur-Fascism"](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/):

1. **Cult of Tradition** – A syncretic belief in ancient truths, rejecting modern interpretations.
2. **Rejection of Modernism** – Viewing the Enlightenment and rationalism as the root of moral decline.
3. **Cult of Action for Action’s Sake** – Valuing action over reflection, leading to anti-intellectualism.
4. **Disagreement is Treason** – Suppressing dissent and critical thinking as threats to unity.
5. **Fear of Difference** – Exploiting xenophobia and racism to unify the in-group against outsiders.
6. **Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class** – Mobilizing those feeling economically or socially displaced.
7. **Obsession with a Plot** – Promoting conspiracy theories to justify aggression against perceived enemies.
8. **Enemies are Both Too Strong and Too Weak** – Portraying adversaries as simultaneously formidable and feeble.
9. **Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy** – Viewing life as perpetual warfare, dismissing peace efforts as betrayal.
10. **Contempt for the Weak** – Glorifying strength and dismissing compassion as weakness.
11. **Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero** – Promoting a cult of death and martyrdom.
12. **Machismo** – Elevating aggressive masculinity and denigrating non-conforming sexual behaviors.
13. **Selective Populism** – Claiming to represent the unified will of the people, dismissing individual rights.
14. **Newspeak** – Employing an impoverished vocabulary to limit critical thought.
