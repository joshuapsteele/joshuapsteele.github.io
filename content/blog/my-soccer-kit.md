I've been playing some co-ed rec soccer recently. It's been a lot of fun, and also a reminder that I've gotten out of shape and I'm getting older (I'm now 34, and everyone else on my team is in their 20s). But I'm enjoying it nonetheless.

Anyways, I thought I'd share my current soccer kit — the gear I use when I play soccer.

## My Cardio Workout

First, I have to call out the ["John Terry Treadmill Workout"](https://www.thickaccent.com/2023/07/28/the-john-terry-treadmill-workout-leaving-fans-begging-for-mercy/), because it's what's been most helpful in (slowly) getting me back into soccer shape. It's brutal, but effective. As [this Reddit post clarifies](https://www.reddit.com/r/bootroom/comments/bbh3h6/get_match_fit_quick_the_john_terry_routine/): 

- Warm up for around 5 mins or so
- Set your treadmill to a 12% incline
- Turn up the speed. Terry does his at 18 km/h (11.2 mph) but if you're not used to running at that speed, start lower and work your way up. I'm currently at 8.2 mph!
- Run for 20 seconds, then rest for 40 seconds. I usually leave the treadmill running at the full speed and just step off, either fully or with a leg on each side.
- Repeat for 15 rounds

## My Soccer Gear

- [Adidas Samba Indoor Soccer Shoes](https://amzn.to/4r5UGfc) (These are what I wear on the way to the game and when kicking around a soccer ball in my backyard)
- [Puma Attacanto Turf Shoes](https://amzn.to/48rxZux) (These are what I wear for our indoor soccer games on turf)
- [Mitre ULTIMATCH Soccer Ball](https://amzn.to/48cO2eI)
- [ETENWOLF P300 Plus Ball Pump](https://amzn.to/49yI89T)
- [Adidas Defender 5.0 Duffel Bag](https://amzn.to/4oTQJbV)
- [Festty Glasses Straps](https://amzn.to/4p2WxAg) (I'm near-sighted, so I wear my regular glasses during the game so I can see down the field. I've considered getting sports goggles, but haven't yet.)
- [Northdeer Soccer Shin Guards](https://amzn.to/3LUFfq7) (Turns out, no one wears shin guard in my current league, but these are nice for if/when I need them! I've also got some long Adidas soccer socks to go over them, but I usually end up wearing [shorter Adidas socks](https://amzn.to/486abv2) for our indoor games)
- [Open Goaaal 3-in-1 Soccer Training Rebounder & Goal](https://amzn.to/3XGMtR9) (for solo practice at home, plus my kids love it too)
- [Soccer IQ: Things That Smart Players Do, Vol. 1](https://amzn.to/48tOypG) and [Soccer IQ: Things That Smart Players Do, Vol. 2](https://amzn.to/3JRmiUN) (great books for learning/refreshing soccer tactics and strategy)
