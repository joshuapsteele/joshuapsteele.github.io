I finally got my first table saw! A 1947 Craftsman 113.22400 8-inch table saw, for $40 on Facebook Marketplace.

## To Do List

I'm excited to start using it, but first I want to do the following:

- ✅ Disassemble
- Clean (in progress)
- Remove Rust (in progress)
- Lubricate (in progress)
- Replace faulty power toggle switch (in progress)
- Replace blade
- Reassemble

## Manuals

Thanks to the folks over at [Vintage Machinery](http://vintagemachinery.org/), it was easy enough to find the following manual PDFs for the saw and for the 1/2 HP motor:

- [Craftsman 113.1011 and 113.22400 Table Saw Manual](/files/craftsman_table_saw_manual.pdf)
- [Craftsman 115.6962 Motor Manual](/files/craftsman_table_saw_motor_manual.pdf)

Here are two diagrams from the manual, illustrating the various parts of the table saw.

And here is a diagram of the motor.

## Questions/Problems I'm Researching

### Cleaning the rip fence thoroughly

This shouldn't be too hard, but I need to figure out how to disassemble the rip fence so that I can thoroughly clean the parts and remove rust. I just haven't been able to find a good YouTube video that covers this specifically, so I'll need to do a bit of manual-guided experimentation and then use an Evaporust soak and/or a Rustoleum gel spray.

### Getting a bigger motor pulley for the 1750 RPM motor

According to the table saw manual, 

> This saw is designed to be used with a 3450 rpm motor of the repulsion-induction or capacitor type; ½ hp for light duty, ¾ hp for heavy duty. ... If a 1750 rpm motor is used it will be necessary to purchase a six-inch pulley and a longer belt.

The motor I have, the Craftsman 115.6962, is a 1750 rpm motor. And its pulley is not a 6-inch pulley, but rather approximately a 3-inch pulley.

So, I need to figure out **exactly which 6-inch pulley I need, and where to purchase one**.

I'll either update this blog post or add new posts as I get this saw back in tip-top shape!
