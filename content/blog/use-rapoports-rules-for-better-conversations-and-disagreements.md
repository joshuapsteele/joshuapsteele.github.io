I’m reading Walter Sinnott-Armstrong’s excellent book, [*Think Again: How to Reason and Argue*](https://amzn.to/2BNTlTq).

In it (on pages 25–26), I came across [“Rapoport’s Rules.”](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules)

First formulated by mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport and discussed by Daniel Dennett ([*Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking*](https://amzn.to/2NmrH4m), 31–35), here they are:

> 1: You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”
> 
>  2: You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
> 
>  3: You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
> 
>  4: Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.

How would our conversations—everything from family dinner to classroom discussions to church business meetings—look different if we put these rules into practice?
