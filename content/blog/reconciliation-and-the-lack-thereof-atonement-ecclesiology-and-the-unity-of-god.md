## Introduction: The Problem of Christian Disunity

"[I pray] that they will all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you. I pray that they will be in us, so that the world will believe that you sent me." (John 17:21)

Ever since Jesus first uttered these words, his followers have done what appears to be an increasingly worse job of being one. A simple count of the various denominations and sects within Christianity—Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the thousands of Protestant denominations—reveals the troubling truth that, although claiming to follow the same Lord, Christians around the world are often divided.

Throughout church history, the modus operandi has been to pursue unity in orthodoxy through division. When dissenting voices arise, the group decides which option is "orthodox," banishes the "heretics" (who often form their own camp), and proceeds as the "pure" and "united" bride of Christ. Whether in 1054, 1517, or today, followers of Jesus have often judged it more important to be correct than to be one.

**This essay argues that there is a connection between the lack of ecclesiological reconciliation and the doctrine of reconciliation itself.** Could it be, as Scot McKnight suggests, that "we are not reconciled more in this world—among Christians, within the USA, and between countries—because we have shaped our atonement theories to keep our group the same and others out?"

## Divine Perfections and Atonement Theories

This essay depends largely on Adam Johnson's synthesis of Karl Barth's thought on theology proper and the doctrine of reconciliation. Johnson proposes that:

> Barth's understanding of God's triune being-in-act in the fullness of the divine perfections, brought to bear upon our sinful condition in the fulfillment of his covenantal purposes through the person and work of Jesus Christ, provides the proper theological framework for developing the doctrine of the atonement, and contains within itself the basis and the impetus for a theological explanation of the unity and diversity of Christ's atoning work.

In other words, **the "key" to unlocking the unity and diversity of the atonement is the subject of the act: the triune God in the fullness of his divine perfections.** Every theory of the atonement necessarily relies on one or more divine perfections in its construal of our sin and Christ's saving work.

The Church is bound by the biblical witness to understand reconciliation in light of each of the divine perfections. This essay brings this theological method to bear on the divine perfection of **unity**—a perfection often neglected in atonement theology.

## God is One: Unity Defined

Karl Barth makes the bold statement that "all the perfections of the divine being taken together, can be summed up in this one conception. If we understand it rightly, we can express all that God is by saying that God is One."

However, understanding this divine perfection rightly is crucial. We must not abstract or absolutize the divine attributes. **God defines his perfections; they do not define him.** "We must say that God is the absolute One, but we cannot say that the absolutely one is God."

When unity is divorced from God's essence, we end up worshipping idols—anything that fulfills our "religious glorification of the number 'one.'" At the core of the disunity from which humanity must be saved is a misunderstanding of what true unity is.

God's unity has both an **external** and an **internal** dimension:

### Uniqueness (External Unity)

The triune God in the fullness of the divine perfections is **unique** in that he is utterly without equal. "God alone is God. He is the only one of his kind." This uniqueness is proper to the divine essence and not contingent upon creation. God would still be unique even if nothing else existed.

Because he alone is the self-existent one, "everything else is what it is by him, and therefore [is unique] only dependently, in a contingent and figurative sense, and therefore not in a way that competes with God."

As Tertullian emphasized: "Deus, si non unus est, non est" (God, if he is not one, is not). This foundational tenet of Christian faith is antithetical to idolatry and polytheism. God's oneness is so absolute that it casts all false gods into nothingness and renders all other forms of uniqueness relative. **He alone is God alone.**

### Simplicity (Internal Unity)

The internal complement to God's external uniqueness is his **simplicity**. For God to be simple does not mean he is uncomplicated or easily understood, but rather that "in all that he is and does, he is wholly and undividedly himself."

This means that "at no time or place is he composed out of what is distinct from himself" and "at no time or place is he divided or divisible."

However, we must not paint a caricature of God's unity as homogenous, flat, and dull—as simplistic in the pejorative sense. **God is One even in the distinctions of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is One even in the wealth of his distinguishable perfections.**

The divine perfection of simple unity cannot refer to simplistic homogeneity, for God has eternally existed in the otherness contained within the Trinity. God's simplicity is robust and diverse. At the intersection of divine unity and otherness is **perichoresis**—"the mutual interdependence, or mutual interpenetration of the persons of the Trinity."

This diverse and relational unity within the Trinity, the divine perfections, and God's being-in-act must inform our notions of what simplicity means when speaking of God.

## Creation: Unity Shared

At creation, God shares his unity in both senses (uniqueness and simplicity). Although this does not imply an ontological identification of God with the world, it does extend the same kind of unity appropriate to the Godhead outward to that which is not God.

**Recognition of the unity of God is the human response to the summons and action of this incomparable and undivided being.** This epistemic recognition was eternally designed to coincide with an ontic reality—that is, the proper creaturely response to God entails both knowing and being/doing.

The proper epistemic and ontic responses to God's oneness can both be seen in the Great Shema of Deuteronomy 6:4-5.

### Recognizing God's Uniqueness

"Listen, Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!" (Deuteronomy 6:4)

As "the paranetic introduction to the law code," this verse has "at its heart the primary command to be loyal to Yahweh alone." The covenant makes the relationship between Yahweh and Israel exclusive. The immediate consequence is the command: "Love the LORD your God" (v. 5). This is the language of covenant loyalty.

Deuteronomy 6:4 urges Israel toward covenantal faithfulness in obedience of all Yahweh's commands on the basis of his unique oneness. This reflects God's creative purposes as a microcosm (respective to Israel) of the universally appropriate creaturely response to divine uniqueness.

### Demonstrating God's Simplicity

God desires to share his internal simplicity with humanity. Humanity was to be simple (undivided) in its relationship with itself, the rest of creation, and with God.

The syntax of Deuteronomy 6:4, with *ekhad* ("one") in the final climactic position, suggests that "'oneness' is in some sense part of Yahweh's nature. The nuance shifts therefore from 'uniqueness' to 'unity', or integrity. Yahweh is one and indivisible."

On the basis of this divine oneness, Israel was to love and worship God in complete devotion: "You must love the Lord your God with your whole mind, your whole being, and all your strength" (Deuteronomy 6:5). The force of these three terms in combination "is to require a devotion that is single-minded and complete."

### Shalom Unity

God's oneness is also **peaceful**—characterized by *shalom*. Just as it is inappropriate to assume that shalom ("peace") is merely the absence of conflict, it is inappropriate to assume that God desires creation to be unified by becoming homogenous and static.

The eternal God thrives in the otherness inherent to the Trinity. His unity is diverse and robust. It is reasonable to assume that he desires to share the same robust and diverse unity with his creation as it functions in perfect shalom—peace and fullness.

However, a quick observation of the created order reveals that reality does not currently correspond to this idyllic notion of shalom unity throughout the universe. What has gone wrong?

## Sin: Unity Perverted

Sin is "a rupture and a breaking off of the original unity established by God." As "a continuous decomposition, disorganization and dissolution of the unity created by God," sin thoroughly perverts the divine aspects of unity, both externally and internally.

### Profaning God's Uniqueness

**First, sin ignores and profanes God's unique unity.** "By the free acceptance of sin, the innate connection between man and God was destroyed. And so man, instead of loving God and being his servant, in a world of which he was designed to be prophet, priest, and king, became an alien and a stranger."

Of all the idols ever worshipped instead of the one triune God, **the self has pride of place.** In a horrific distortion of God's unity, which should lead to faithful worship, we worship instead the false god of self, leading to an endless cycle of desperate attempts to satiate our own cravings and desires.

The result is that "sin abolishes man as a person. It is a decomposition of his very being, it makes him live this divided and disorganized life for himself, and thus it deprives him of the possibility of living in fellowship with others and with God."

### Twisting God's Simplicity

**Second, sin twists God's robust, simple unity, intended to be shared with creation in shalom, into schism, the demonization of otherness, and the construction of false unities.**

We are no longer simple beings, for the schism has infected our very selves. "Through sin, man became a stranger to his communion with God, a stranger to his fellowship with the human 'other,' and even a stranger to himself."

Consider the prideful and idolatrous disobedience manifested at Babel (Genesis 11:1-9). Despite having the resource of linguistic commonality with which to maintain a robust unity to glorify God as they filled the earth and subdued it, humanity attempted to construct a false unity to glorify themselves and remain in one location. The ensuing divine dispersal and confusion of languages revealed God's intolerance of and humanity's penchant toward false unity.

**Sin drives against the grain of the universe,** implanting within humanity the desire to rebel against the One God and fragment into countless factions. We have lost the appropriate valuing of diversity and otherness. Instead of welcoming the other, we are far more likely to crucify her. We gather like-minded people around us to construct our own "unified" kingdoms, building thick walls between "us" inside and "them" outside.

Constantly concerned with why our sect is "unique" above all others, we lose sight of God's uniqueness and make a mockery of his simplicity.

## Fall: Distance and Exile

If God is One, what is his response to these perversions of the robust unity he desires to share with creation?

Just as God's righteousness takes the appropriate redemptive mode of wrath when confronted with sin as unrighteousness, **God's unity takes the appropriate character of exile or separation** (though not division) in the presence of sin as either schism or false unity.

This strong reaction is possible because there has always been otherness and distance within the Trinity itself. It is completely appropriate for the Trinity to "stretch" in its dynamic perichoresis. It is all the more appropriate, then, for God to distance himself from the perversions of sin. **God cannot tolerate a false, schismatic unity with his creation and his people.**

When sin enters the created order, God responds with distance until true unity can be achieved. We see this first in Genesis 3, when Adam and Eve are banished from the Garden of Eden and creation itself is cursed. According to John Walton, "the biggest problem of the Fall was…the loss of access to the presence of God. The overwhelming loss was not paradise; it was God."

Nevertheless, **God remains merciful** in his righteous reaction to schismatic sin, for he patiently refuses to sentence human sin with the full and permanent exile it deserves. The redemptive missio Dei explains why God first responds with distance. To hastily drag his divisive creatures back into full fellowship would create a disastrous false unity.

God partially and temporarily separates himself from his sin-stained creation for the greater goal of achieving true at-one-ment with it in the end. This explains why, despite the schismatic perversion of his oneness, he calls Abraham and Israel back to unity through the covenants. He seeks to be recognized in his uniqueness by the people of Israel and to share his simplicity with them through Torah and the covenants.

However, the unfaithfulness of the Israelites proves hardhearted. In a righteous response, God distances their schismatic sin from his perfect unity once more through the exile of the nation. Nevertheless, even on the brink of exile he promises to make a new covenant with them (Jeremiah 31). No matter how unfaithful they prove, the One God is always consistent to his own faithful character.

## Christ: Unity Stretched

In light of the oneness of God, the heinous nature of sin, and the pitiful state of humanity left in exile, **the saving work of Christ is that of re-unification, of reconciliation, and of at-one-ment, both internal and external.**

Through the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Son of God, the triune God meets humanity in its partial exile, sentences himself to the utmost exile in their stead at the cross, and brings the Son and all who are united with him in faith back from the far country of death and exile into full union with the Godhead.

### Incarnation

At the incarnation, **the Trinity stretches** through the election of God to become Jesus of Nazareth. God's being-in-act takes the eternal shape of this election. We look to Christ and Christ alone to witness and experience the fullness of the Godhead and the divine perfections.

Within a unity-based atonement framework, the incarnation takes on distinctive importance, for it is in this specific act that God assumes human flesh, meeting us in our state of partial exile. **"God became what we are so that we might become what He is."**

In the Old Israel, the relationship between God and the people was a sort of subject-object relationship. God was acting behind the veil of human history, speaking from outside as an external law or prophetic assurance. **In the New Israel, the oneness of the people is the result of symbiosis and dwelling—God among men** (John 1:14).

The fundamental difference lies in the radical change from a subject-object relationship to one of participation or communion. God no longer acts in human history as an external factor but enters himself into the scene of human history and becomes the central person in it.

In this "radical change," God closes the gap which had been righteously created through banishment. As McKnight puts it, "incarnation means identification for the sake of liberation." **The atonement begins in the perichoresis of God**—that eternal communion of interpersonal love—and that perichoresis becomes incarnate in the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who assumes what we are in order to draw us into that perichoresis.

He alone is worthy to exile and banish. However, he also takes on himself our sin-stained human nature. "Because our evil case otherwise meant our inevitable destruction, God willed to make it His own in Jesus Christ." Without succumbing to sin's siren call, he is fully affected by it, bringing this nature into the life of God and thereby intensifying the divine reaction against it.

When the Son comes down to assume human flesh, he also brings human flesh into the Godhead, creating an ultimate tension. "Our sin is no longer our own. It is his sin, the sin of Jesus Christ. God—he himself as the obedient Son of the Father—has made it his own."

**The one ultimately worthy to exile is now also the one ultimately worthy of exile.**

### Death

At the cross, **the Trinity stretches to the utmost.** The sense of this can be felt in Jesus' cry of dereliction: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34).

However, this stretching of the Trinity is not foreign to the divine essence but appropriate to it. As Miroslav Volf notes, "the very nature of the triune God is reflected on the cross of Christ. Inversely, the cross of Christ is etched in the heart of the triune God; Christ's passion is God's passion."

**At the cross, the One God subjects himself to the full exile in place of schismatic sinners.**

The Son of God, worthy to mete out the sentence of exile, instead goes into exile—into the far country of death and the grave—bearing the righteous consequences of the perversions of God's unity for the sake of humanity's salvation.

"At the heart of the cross is Christ's stance of not letting the other remain an enemy and of creating space in himself for the offender to come in." Read as the culmination of the larger narrative of God's dealing with humanity, the cross says that despite its manifest enmity toward God, humanity belongs to God; **God will not be God without humanity.**

### Resurrection

The full exile of the Son of God is followed by **his ultimate vindication** as the Savior of the world. He is raised up from the grave and brought back from the far country of death.

Through this movement of the Son into the utmost exile and back again, sin itself as the perversion of God's unity is offered up to destruction: "In the suffering and death of Jesus Christ it has come to pass that in his own person he has made an end of us as sinners and therefore of sin itself by going to death as the One who took our place as sinners."

Gloriously, **all humanity who is united to him by grace through faith**—everyone who is in Christ—**gets caught up with the Son in his return** to the simple and unique perichoretic unity of the triune God (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:20-22).

The importance of this grace-mediating faith and its relevance to the unity of God's people should not be overlooked: "There is no simplicity in the Church except for the simplicity of faith in this God who is trustworthy. There is no simplicity except for that of straightforward trust in the power of the mystery now revealed of the incarnation of the Word and the divine trinity."

Apart from union with Christ, humanity is left in its sorry state. For "if 'in' Adam we sin and die, so 'in' Christ we become righteous [and unified] and live. In other words, it is all about 'with and to whom' we are united."

**The only hope for human unity is not an artificially constructed consensus, but recapitulation in the unique person of the incarnate Logos, Jesus the Messiah.** "If there is unity, it is because the re-creation of the human person is realized in Christ," for "in the person of Christ all distinctions and divisions are abolished."

The resurrection is crucial, for "atonement is both the elimination of the problem and the enablement of a new life." The focus of the atonement is not merely to sentence sin with its proper exile, but to fulfill God's creative purposes for fellowship and unity. **Redemption and (re-)creation meet in the resurrection.** This new, divine life available to humans in Christ is "ecclesial: resurrection creates a new community for all."

## Salvation: Unity Restored

Salvation, then, is this **unmerited entrance, through and in the Son, into the unified Trinitarian life of the Godhead.** Internally and externally, unity is restored. The people of God are set free from their perverse desires to divide and create false unities. Instead, they are placed in right, unified relationship with themselves, each other, creation, and God, who is eternally recognized and worshipped as God alone.

These themes come together in Jesus' prayer in John 17:20-26, where his "vision of a unified community, transcending mere institutional unity, encompasses present as well as future believers." In this prayer, **"nothing less than human participation in the perichoresis is in view."**

"The oneness of the people of God is not understood as an autonomous and enclosed reality but as a continuous and dynamic share of the divine fullness and oneness…the divine oneness transforms human multiplicity into a harmonious agreement."

When Jesus prays to the Father that his followers might be one, it is not a polite request that Christians might one day learn to get along better and arrive at consensus. **It is a bold request that their unity might flow from the perichoretic unity by which the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father** (John 17:21).

In this prayer, we are given a behind-the-scenes look at how the atonement works and what exactly salvation entails. The eternal life we are saved to is a relational knowledge of (cf. John 17:3) and union with God (cf. 17:20-23).

## Ecclesiological Relevance

In John 17:21, we find **the desired end** (the unity of the church), **the theological means** (invitation through Christ into the divine perichoresis of God's oneness), and **the desired missional effect** (global belief in the redemptive missio Dei as accomplished in the Messiah).

"Unless [Christians] are unified, how can they expect to give authentic, credible testimony to the Father, who is united with the Son and the Spirit in revealing himself and his salvation in Christ?"

**The burden of this paper has been to show that church unity is not just a secondary addition to the gospel message, but an integral part of the gospel itself.** If this unity-based theory of the atonement has theological and exegetical merit, then the church is obligated to respond to the truths therein, for **a divided and divisive church denies in praxis the gospel it proclaims.**

According to God's creative purposes, this theory demands that God's unique unity be recognized and that his simple unity be demonstrated.

### Recognizing God's Uniqueness

We must cast down our idols and worship him alone. Complete and total devotion is the only appropriate response to the one true God. Although physical idols may not be as universally common today, invisible idols are as prevalent as ever, especially within Western materialism, where money, possessions, influence, and power are the modern-day Baal.

### Demonstrating God's Simplicity

We must seek unity with ourselves, each other, all of creation, and God himself. In doing so, **we must reject false unities in favor of true ones.**

There seems to be an appropriate place for distance within the life of the church, in light of the redemptive mode of God's unity in the presence of sin. However, we must be extremely careful when presuming to exercise this righteous act of distancing ourselves, for at least two reasons:

1. **The idolatrous desires of our own hearts tend toward a false, absolutized unity which demonizes otherness.** The fundamentalist doctrine of "biblical separation" is too often claimed when the real problem is not heresy but diversity—which is not a problem at all given the inherent otherness within the Trinity.

2. **God exercised this redemptive separation in order that true unity might be achieved through Christ, not to keep himself pure and unstained from a creation he wanted nothing to do with.** If God did not completely separate himself from a truly sinful creation in order that he might one day have robust unity with it once more, what right do we have to completely separate ourselves from our brothers and sisters in Christ for what often amounts to mere differences of opinion?

In light of God's oneness and his redemptive, unifying mission, **we must watch out for and avoid the most dangerous heretics: those who cause divisions in opposition to the unifying missio Dei** (cf. Romans 16:17). Christians should only separate from one another for the gravest divisive offenses in doctrine and praxis. Even then, this separation should only be partial and temporary. Every effort should then be made to achieve true unity within the church.

**Ecumenism and catholicity are to be embraced, not feared.** To claim the pursuit of righteousness and doctrinal purity at the expense of unity, especially the unity of the church, is therefore a shameful undoing of the work of God in Jesus Christ to reconcile all things to himself (Colossians 1:20).

### Living Out Unity

The apostle Paul exhorts us to "live worthily of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Ephesians 4:1-3).

"The theological basis on which this way of life must be built" is provided in the next three verses: **"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you too were called to the one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all"** (Ephesians 4:4-6).

If we are unified with one another in our willingness to confess these truths, then we should be willing to engage in the practical attitudes and actions that foster the unity of the church for which Christ died.

Nevertheless, this pursuit of robust unity is rarely easy. "As God does not abandon the godless to their evil but gives the divine self for them in order to receive them into divine communion through atonement, so also should we—whoever our enemies and whoever we may be."

Our demonstrations of simple unity should not only prompt us to encourage unity where it already occurs, but **to engage areas of division and strife as ambassadors for unity**, reaching out to both victims and aggressors when it comes to schism and discord. We are called to show humility, gentleness, and patience to even the most divisive and argumentative types of people, extending the oneness of God to even the darkest, divided corners of his creation.

As we actively seek reconciliation and unity, even when costly to do so, may we as the people of God be able to exclaim with Paul:

> All these things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation. In other words, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting people's trespasses against them, and he has given us the message of reconciliation. Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His plea through us. We plead with you on Christ's behalf, "Be reconciled to God!" (2 Corinthians 5:18-20)

## Conclusion

It is theologically and exegetically legitimate to view the atonement as the act in which the One God fulfills his creative purposes by bringing his incomparable uniqueness and undivided simplicity to bear on our sinful, divisive condition through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah in order to save a people to robust unity with himself, each other, and the entire creation.

At creation, God shares his unity with creation, resulting in appropriate epistemic and ontic creaturely responses. However, the entrance of sin perverts these aspects of unity, both internally and externally. In response, God's unity takes on the redemptive mode of distancing and separation through banishment and exile—though he mercifully refuses to sentence human sin with the full and permanent exile it deserves.

Christ's saving work is that of re-unification, reconciliation, and at-one-ment. At the incarnation, the Trinity stretches as the Son assumes human flesh and meets humanity in its state of partial exile. At the cross, the Trinity stretches to the utmost as the Son subjects himself to full exile in place of schismatic sinners. At the resurrection, the Son is vindicated and brought back from exile, and all who are united to him by faith are caught up in his return to the simple and unique perichoretic unity of the triune God.

Salvation is this unmerited entrance, through and in the Son, into the unified Trinitarian life of the Godhead. Internally and externally, unity is restored.

**The global church of Jesus Christ therefore has the responsibility and privilege of bringing these unifying atonement realities to bear on the here and now.** We must honor the unique unity of God by eschewing all forms of idolatry as we worship him alone. We must demonstrate the simple unity of God by valuing otherness, transcending our differences, and pursuing true, robust unity in fulfillment of the missio Dei.

Then, and only then, will the high priestly prayer of the One who faced exile in our stead be answered: "[I pray] that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me" (John 17:21).
