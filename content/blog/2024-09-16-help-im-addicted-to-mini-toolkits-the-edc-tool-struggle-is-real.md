title: "Help, I'm Addicted to Mini Toolkits: The EDC Tool Struggle Is Real"

I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.

Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).

It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.

OK, but what about these “mini toolkits”?

It all started when I got the [Sunex Tools 44-Piece 1/4″ Drive Mini Dual Flex Head Ratchet with Socket &amp; Bit Set (9732)](https://amzn.to/3XVS6fv). I love the extra SAE/Metric flexibility from the spline sockets. And it’s got basically every bit I’ve needed.

Those spline sockets in the Sunex are actually why I ended up returning [the extremely popular Wera Tool-Check Plus kit](https://amzn.to/3XM6KG2) after giving it a try. Sure, it’s definitely sexier and machined a bit better than the Sunex, but the Sunex sockets saved me at least once when the Wera failed me, so I really couldn’t justify keeping the (fairly expensive) Wera kit around.

Sure, I wish the Sunex kit had a better case, and could fit in my pocket, if needed…

So, enter what [the r/HarborFreight subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/) calls the “Meme Tool”: the [ICON Locking Flex Head Ratchet and Bit Set, 35-Piece](https://www.harborfreight.com/locking-flex-head-ratchet-and-bit-set-35-piece-58074.html). She’s a beauty. I love that the ratchet is a \*locking\* flex head. The extension can be used in multiple configurations to get at just about any fastener. And, again, basically every bit I’ve ever needed.

NTDT!" width="750"></iframe></div></figure>What’s more, it’s got a no-hassle lifetime warranty, so if I happen to break something, I can go to the nearest Harbor Freight and get a new kit!

I carry the Harbor Freight “Meme Tool” kit around with me most places, in addition to the Harbor Freight Leatherman Wave knockoff, the [GORDON 20-in-1 Multi-Tool](https://www.harborfreight.com/20-in-1-multi-tool-59617.html).

The only thing the Harbor Freight meme tool is missing is \*sockets\*! This is the one thing the Sunex kit wins-out on. I wish there were a way to combine the nice case, better ratchet, and useful extension from the HF Icon kit with he sockets of the Sunex kit.

Turns out, I’m not the only one who feels this way! Someone over at r/HarborFreight has [designed a print-it-yourself case that can hold the original items from the Icon set plus sockets (they call it the ICAN’T, lol).](https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/comments/1dhj1o8/i_present_to_you_hooligans_v2_the_icant/)

The only reason I haven’t bought [one of those modified ICAN’T cases from the absolute genius on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/jaahwnsstuff/?etsrc=sdt) is that, last year at the SEMA 2023 conference, Harbor Freight unveiled a new “Meme Tool + Sockets” and said that it would come out sometime in 2024!

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pr4fG5NzCo?start=585&feature=oembed" title="Unveiling all the NEW Harbor Freight Tools At SEMA 2023!" width="750"></iframe></div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Start at 9:45 to see the Meme Tool w/Sockets</figcaption></figure>So, here we are. It’s mid-September and I’m checking r/HarborFreight and the Harbor Freight website daily to see if the new Meme Tool w/Sockets is out yet.

And, while I wait for Harbor Freight to come through, I can’t help but notice other ratchet, bit, and socket combinations out there (like [this one from P.I.T.](https://amzn.to/4d8MDWV), or [this one from Bosch](https://amzn.to/4epaaUC))!

Yes, I probably have a problem. But does anyone else out there have the same problem? Have you found a mini toolkit that you absolutely love? What about other EDC tools? Please let me know in the comments below!
