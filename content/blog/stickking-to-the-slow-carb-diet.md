Last night, the scale read 192.4. I’d really like it to read 180 or less.

So, in lieu of how effective [putting money on the line via StickK](https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/) has been for my daily writing habit these past two weeks, I’ve decided to put money on the line as motivation to stick to the Slow Carb Diet for a month.

For my writing habit, I’ve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 goes to the NRA. (I’m a pacifist. I do not like the NRA.)

For my Slow Carb Diet commitment, I’m going to keep the diet 6 days a week for 4 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 will go to NARAL Pro Choice America. (I’m pro-life. I think abortion is a tragedy.)

## Try StickK

If there’s a habit that you’d like to develop or quit, I highly recommend giving [StickK](https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/) a try! Fear of losing money to an organization you hate is a powerful motivator!

## Try the Slow Carb Diet

And if you’d like to lose fat/weight, I highly recommend the [Slow Carb Diet](https://medium.com/@erinfrey/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slow-carb-diet-a67062761d92).

It’s built around 5 simple rules.

> Rule #1: Avoid “white” starchy carbohydrates (or those that can be white). This means all bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and grains. If you have to ask, don’t eat it.
> 
>  Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. You already do this; you’re just picking new default meals.
> 
>  Rule #3: Don’t drink calories. Exception: 1-2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed.
> 
>  Rule #4: Don’t eat fruit. (Fructose –&gt; glycerol phosphate –&gt; more bodyfat, more or less.) Avocado and tomatoes are excepted.
> 
>  Rule #5: Take one day off per week and go nuts. I choose and recommend Saturday.

There’s a [pretty active sub-Reddit devoted to the Slow Carb Diet](https://www.reddit.com/r/4hourbodyslowcarb/) if you’d like more information.

Cheers!
