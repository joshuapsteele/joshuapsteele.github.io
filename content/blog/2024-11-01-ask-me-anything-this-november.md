I'd love to blog more regularly, and I love answering questions. So [the "WeblogPoMo AMA" challenge caught my eye](https://weblogpomo.club/challenges)!

> For this challenge I want to foster writer interaction: write a blog post starting with a question—the AMA—and then answer the question yourself in the blog post. Others will likewise write AMA/question posts, but also answer the AMA/questions from other bloggers, linking to their initial post. I [brainstormed a bit on this idea](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/10/weblogpomo-challenges#ama-challenge) when I first thought about creating WeblogPoMo Challenges.

What question(s) should I answer this month? Please let me know, either by (1) replying to me on the social network you saw this post on or (2) sending an email to [blog@joshuapsteele.com](blog@joshuapsteele.com).
