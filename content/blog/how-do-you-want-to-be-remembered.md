Do you know what the worst thing about ***death*** is?

It’s not the <u>dying</u> itself – its the **separation**.

That is, we don’t suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.

A sad reality, to be sure.

### What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage?

I’m convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 –

> <span class="text Eccl-7-2" id="en-NIV-17432">It is better to go to a house of mourning</span>  
> <span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">than to go to a house of feasting,</span></span>  
> <span class="text Eccl-7-2">for death is the destiny of everyone;</span>  
> <span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">the living should take this to heart.</span></span>

Now, obviously, simply taking death to heart isn’t enough to defeat our most ancient enemy. For that, we need (and have been given) a ***resurrection***.

But, have you taken your own death to heart? I believe there’s something to be gained by considering how you’d like to be remembered by others after you die.

## How do you want to be remembered:

- ## by God?
- ## by your spouse?
- ## by your children?
- ## by your parents?
- ## by your family and friends?
- ## by your colleagues?

For me, I’d like to be remembered:

- …as God’s faithful servant.
- …as my wife’s best friend.
- …as my children’s most important teacher.
- …as my parents’ legacy.
- …as my family and friends’ loyal brother.
- …as my colleagues inspiring teammate.

…which sounds great, right? But here’s the rub:

## What <u>changes</u> do you and I need to make in our lives, to start making those hypothetical memories more realistic each day?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this in the comments below, as I consider how taking death to heart should impact one’s entire life.
