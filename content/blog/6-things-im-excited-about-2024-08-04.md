1. Sweater weather
2. Losing weight with some help from Zepbound
3. Football season (pulling for the Detroit Lions and the University of Michigan Wolverines)
4. Harbor Freight coming out with [version 2.0 of its “meme tool”](https://www.reddit.com/r/harborfreight/comments/17mj1sv/from_sema_2023_the_meme_mini_socket_set_is/) – now with sockets! Hopefully out before the end of the year
5. Reading [*The Widening of God’s Mercy: Sexuality Within the Biblical Story*](https://amzn.to/3z6A93Y) by Christopher and Richard Hays when it comes out next week
6. Learning auto repair by working on my dad’s 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 (next up: replacing the governor pressure solenoid and sensor in the transmission, which will hopefully help with the truck getting stuck in low gear!)

What are you excited about these days?
