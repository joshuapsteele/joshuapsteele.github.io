Our goal is to assist [the Stone families](http://www.abweperu.org/page_family/pagefamily.php?id=12) (Dave &amp; Evelyn; Jonathan &amp; Angela) in their various local ministries, including:

- [Seminario Teológico Bautista](http://www.stblima.org/) (Seminary)
- [Luz del Camino Iglesia](http://luzdelcaminosb.wix.com/luzdelcamino/) (Church)
- [Vida Nueva Centro Prenatal](http://www.centroprenatal.org/) (Pregnancy Center)

The goal of Beeson’s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to “*expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting*.” In addition to fulfilling this goal, we believe that this trip to Peru will be **influential in determining the future involvement of both our families in global missions**. God’s given each of us unique gifts — ranging from medicine to math, theology to linguistics. But **He’s blessed us all with a heart for His global Gospel and his global Church**.

Frankly, we realize that **we have much more to learn than to offer! But we’re excited to learn valuable lessons in Lima. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Would you please pray for us as we prepare for this trip?</span>**

Finally, if you’re interested in partnering with us financially to make this trip a reality, please visit [our YouCaring.Com page. ](http://www.youcaring.com/mission-trip-fundraiser/peru-or-bust-deboer-and-steele/147648)

Grace and Peace,
