# Podcasts: An Introduction

Although podcasts (think “iPod” + “broadcast”) have been around for over a decade, we’re living in a bit of a golden age – or a least a Rennaissance – of the medium. For the uninitiated, here’s a nice video about what podcasts are:

Currently, podcasts are one of my very favorite ways to consume information about a wide variety of topics. Sure, gun to my head, I’ll choose books over podcasts as a way to learn. However, unlike books (or videos), you can easily listen to podcasts while doing other things – whether folding laundry, washing dishes, or going for a run/walk.

(Note: as I mentioned in [my list of favorite tools and apps](https://joshuapsteele.com/tools), [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) is my current favorite podcast player. Although, there are plenty of other worthy podcast players/managers to check out!)

There are no shortage of podcasts, or lists of best podcasts, for that matter. However, here are my current favorites.

# My Favorite Podcasts:

## [Up First (NPR)](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first)

This is the first podcast I listen to every weekday while making coffee. I love that it’s short (˜10 minutes) and that it provides some snapshots of important news stories that day. In addition to Up First, I frequently listen to NPR newscasts via their [NPR One app](http://one.npr.org/), which is worth checking out!

## [The Art of Manliness](http://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/)

Sure, the egalitarian in me wishes there were a show out there called “The Art of Humanity” – about how to be a *Mensch.* However, in the meantime, Brett McKay has a solid podcast going about “reviving the lost art of manliness.” I enjoy the podcast (and t[he Art of Manliness website](http://www.artofmanliness.com/)) because it includes so many helpful how-to guides – for everything from weightlifting to men’s fashion.

## [Word &amp; Table](https://wordandtable.simplecast.fm/)

I created [Rookie Anglican](http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/) as a way of making Anglicanism more accessible. This podcast, Word &amp; Table, has much the same mission, although it’s focus is not just on Anglicanism, but rather on the rich Christian tradition of liturgical worship. As I wrote about the podcast [over at Rookie Anglican](http://anglicanpastor.com/listen-to-the-word-table-podcast-to-learn-more-about-liturgical-and-sacramental-christian-worship/):

> According to their [website](https://wordandtable.simplecast.fm/), Word &amp; Table “is a weekly podcast about liturgy, sacrament, and the great tradition of Christian worship and why it is vital in our world today.”
> 
> The podcast was started back in October 2016, and it’s hosted by [Alex Wilgus](http://www.greenhousemovement.com/team/alex-wilgus/) and Fr. [Stephen Gauthier](http://www.churchrez.org/staff/profile/stephengauthier), the Canon Theologian for the Anglican Church in North America’s Diocese of the Upper Midwest.
> 
> You can subscribe to the podcast via [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/word-table/id1161203280?mt=2), listen to episodes via the [Word &amp; Table website](https://wordandtable.simplecast.fm/), or simply search for “Word and Table” in your podcast player/manager of choice.

If you’ve got questions about anything related to the Christian tradition, check out the Word &amp; Table podcast to see if they have an episode on the topic!

## [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/)

I’ve become somewhat of a Tim Ferriss junkie in the past two years. In addition to this podcast – which features long-form interviews with “top performers,” in which Tim distils tips, tricks, habits, and practices for the common person – Ferriss’ books are well worth checking out (Affiliate LInks: [The 4-Hour Workweek](http://amzn.to/2uTWui7); The [4-Hour Body](http://amzn.to/2uxKdxq); The [4-Hour Chef](http://amzn.to/2h0dtJT); [Tools of Titans](http://amzn.to/2h0dwp3)) . He’s great at teaching *[metalearning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning)* – how to learn how to learn!

(Note: Tim Ferriss is how I found out about [kettlebells](https://joshuapsteele.com/2016/05/25/kettlebell-swings-back-balm-for-the-sedentary-seminarian/) – one of my [favorite tools](https://joshuapsteele.com/tools) for personal fitness.)

## [Coffee Break German](https://radiolingua.com/coffeebreakgerman/)

Sure, Coffee Break German hasn’t taught me the kind of German that I’ll need for my Ph.D. German translation exam. However, it is a very informative introduction to basic/conversational German. It makes a wonderful companion to Duolingo for language learning! Radio Lingua Network offers [a whole suite of “Coffee Break” languages](https://radiolingua.com/), including French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese!

## [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/)

In my opinion, no podcast beats This American Life in terms of the quality and variety of storytelling. It’s well worth your time, in addition to the “spinoff” shows [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/) and [S-Town](https://stownpodcast.org/).
