## The Table Saw

I know you've all been waiting for (lol) updates on my [vintage 1947 Craftsman 113 table saw](/vintage-craftsman-table-saw/).

I'm happy to report that, after disassembling and cleaning the saw, I was able to put it back together and get it running again!

In the process, I installed:

- A new [power toggle switch](https://amzn.to/3QVf5mv) on the motor housing
- A [safety ON/OFF switch for the front of the saw](https://amzn.to/4hXfz6C) (where you stand)
- An [8-inch thin-kerf combination blade](https://amzn.to/4iNvCF7)
- A [6-inch motor pulley](https://amzn.to/4cxyiEV) to replace the original 3-inch pulley (this was recommended in the manual since the motor is a 1750 RPM motor, not a 3450 RPM motor)
- An [adjustable linked v-belt](https://amzn.to/41UHzmI)
- Some [larger caster wheels](https://amzn.to/43upo8x) for the base of the saw

The rip fence provided some extra challenges, mainly because I accidentally broke the cam/clamp handle that holds the fence in place. I originally repaired the handle with some [J-B Weld "SteelStik" epoxy putty](https://amzn.to/42AkfKb), which seemed strong and promising at first.

However, when screwing the rip fence components back into place, which took some force due to rusted threads, the cam handle fell apart again.

Shout-out to my friend Doug, who suggested cleaning-up the threads with a tap and die kit. I've never used one of these before, but I ordered an [SAE/Metric tap and die kit from Amazon](https://amzn.to/3XF18wG). With some 3-in-1 oil and some patience, it worked great for cleaning up the threads on the rod that runs along the inside of the rip fence.

Nevertheless, I wasn't able to put the original handle back together. But after measuring the threads on the rip fence rod, I went out on a limb and tried [this 10-32 interior thread cam lever handle from Amazon](https://amzn.to/4lcbSgf). It didn't quite fit into the handle's original slot, but I was able to extend the rod a bit and it worked great to hold things together!

So, the saw is running pretty well now. I just need to get used to using a table saw (I have a pretty healthy fear of kickback), and figure out what I'm going to make!

## Other Saw News

I bought this [Milescraft saw safety bundle](https://amzn.to/3DZtFqe), which includes a feather board and two different pushers.

Last year, I bought a [Hercules Miter Saw from Harbor Freight Tools](https://www.harborfreight.com/power-tools/power-saws/miter/12-in-dual-bevel-sliding-compound-miter-saw-with-precision-led-shadow-guide-56682.html) in order to install some baseboard trim throughout my house. I haven't used it much since, but it's still going strong and it's nice to have a chop saw ready to go for cross cuts.

Since I'm already invested in the Bauer cordless power tool line from Harbor Freight, and they had a "buy a batter and charger and get a tool for free" deal going, I bought a [Bauer brushless cordless circular saw](https://www.harborfreight.com/20v-brushless-cordless-7-14-in-circular-saw-tool-only-59281.html). So far, I love it. Way nicer than the $20 Chicago Electric corded circular saw (also from HF!) that I've had for years.
