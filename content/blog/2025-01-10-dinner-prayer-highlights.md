Until the past few days, our 4-year-old son, Andrew, has mainly prayed something like the following before dinner: "Dear Jesus, help us to have a good day tomorrow, and help this food to be good."

However, in the past few days, he has started to pray more spontaneously and creatively before dinner. Here are some highlights:

> "Give us this day our holy bread"
> 
> "Help us worship you even when we are in heaven"
> 
> "Help us learn something new this day...the Holy Spirit"
> 
> "Give us good feelings in life"
> 
> "Praise us our day"
> 
> "Help us to be well like you"
> 
> "Help us to not fight anymore, and (looks at candles on the table) bless the candles... And light our holy day with the glory of you"
> 
> "Thank you for making all of these days and everything"
> 
> "Bless our day"
> 
> "Please help us to learn lots about you"
> 
> "Help us to live with your holy son, Jesus, and go with our presence (presents?)"
> 
> "Thank you for making water, and the food that we need. Amen."
