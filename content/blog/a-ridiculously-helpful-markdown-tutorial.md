I’ve been dragging my heels on learning Markdown for awhile now.

If you don’t know, Markdown is:

> [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language "Lightweight markup language") with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") and many other formats using a tool by the same name.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8">[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#cite_note-8)</sup> Markdown is often used to format [readme files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README "README"), for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create [rich text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text "Formatted text") using a [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text") [editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor"). \[Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)\]

That is, get the benefits of HTML and/or rich text, without \[as steep of\] a learning curve!

To make things even easier, I suggest starting with this [Markdown](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/)[ Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/). Should this tutorial prove too basic, it even links to other, more in-depth guides at the end!

I plan to start implementing Markdown in my workflow for this blog, and also for [Rookie Anglican](http://www.rookieanglican.com/).

Cheers!
