Rachel and I are in the middle of our second month of calling Birmingham, Alabama “home.”

While we could both do with a little less humidity (!), we’re enjoying ourselves and our surroundings down here in Alabama.

## What’s Happening in Birmingham, AL:

I don’t start my [M.Div.](http://www.beesondivinity.com/masterofdivinity) coursework at [Beeson Divinity School](http://www.beesondivinity.com/) until late August, but I’ve already started working at [Beeson’s Media Center](http://www.beesondivinity.com/mediacenter) (follow our nascent [Twitter account here](https://twitter.com/BeesonMedia)). It’s an incredibly convenient on-campus job. I’m already thankful for the hospitality of my boss and coworkers. It’s helpful as I learn the ropes of AV, IT, and sundry other tasks.

On the fiction side of things, I heartily recommend *[Life of Pi](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547848412)* by Yann Martel.

Even more so, however, I strongly recommend [Myron Bradley Penner](https://twitter.com/pennerm)‘s *[The End of Apologetics: Christian Witness in a Postmodern Context](http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/the-end-of-apologetics/285611)* to anyone and everyone interested in philosophy, religion, and theology. I plan on devoting a series of posts to a discussion of Penner’s work. For now, suffice it to say the following: This book has already been a godsend in my contemplation of how best to advance God’s Kingdom. (Academically, pastorally, and globally, as I’d say.) Especially in the midst of postmodernity.

Definitely worth a read!

Finally, my current project is reading [Terje Oestigaard’s](http://www.nai.uu.se/research/researchers/terje-oestigaard/) [*Water, Christianity and the Rise of Capitalism*](http://www.amazon.com/Water-Christianity-Capitalism-Terje-Oestigaard/dp/1780760663) to review for[ Liverpool Hope University’s *Theological Book Review*](http://www.hope.ac.uk/theologicalbookreview/). It’s definitely further away from my comfort zone than the [Pentateuch textbook](http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/from-paradise-to-the-promised-land-3rd-edition/230932) I’ve reviewed previously, but hey, I’m trying to branch out. Stay tuned for my feedback.
