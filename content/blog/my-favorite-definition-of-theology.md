This is from Robert Jenson, *Systematic Theology*, Volume 1, p. 11:

> The church has a mission: to see to the speaking of the gospel, whether to the world as message of salvation or to God as appeal and praise. Theology is the reflection internal to the church’s labor on this assignment.

(How) does this definition of “theology” differ from the one you’ve been working with?
