"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel" has long been one of my favorite hymns. This Advent, I've decided to write some additional verses. They emphasize God's heart for the poor and the powerless. 

If you read the Bible looking for these themes, they show up almost everywhere. However, in particular, I've drawn from Leviticus 25, Psalm 113, Isaiah 58, Amos 5, Luke 1, and Luke 14. 

O come, Defender of the weak,  
Teach us their welfare first to seek.  
May widow, orphan, refugee  
Find rest within Thy jubilee!  

O come, Avenger of the poor,  
And open wide redemption's door.  
Undo the yoke, break every chain,  
And with Thee in Thy kingdom let them reign!  

O come, Sustainer of the least,  
And lift them to Thy heavenly feast.  
Cast down the mighty from their seat,  
And fill the hungry with good things to eat!  

O come, O Voice of Prophets bold,  
And bring the Day Thy saints foretold.  
Let justice roll like waters down,  
And righteousness for all abound!
