title: Help me StickK to my writing habit

I need to finish [this dissertation](https://joshuapsteele.com/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/).

To do so, I need to write regularly. For me, that means writing every day—a minimum of 500 words every day.

Last spring, I did a pretty good job of writing regularly. However, I’ve fallen off the wagon for various reasons, and it’s been a bear to get back on!

So, I’ve decided to put some money on the line, using a service called StickK.

If I don’t write 500 words related to my dissertation every day, StickK will donate $35 dollars every week I fail to the NRA.

*(I do not like the NRA.)*

I’m giving this a try for 8 weeks. If it works well, I’ll continue the commitment via StickK!

If you’d like to support me and keep track of my progress on StickK, you can do so by clicking [here](https://stik.to/r2N).

If you have a habit you’d like to stick to, give StickK a try!
