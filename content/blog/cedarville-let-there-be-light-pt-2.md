# Further Questions, All Relating to the University Statement on Dr. Pahl’s Dismissal:

- If Dr. Pahl’s book, [*The Beginning and the End*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270), was controversial enough to lead to his dismissal, why was the book allowed to be used as a textbook last school year? 
    - Shouldn’t we trust the Bible professors’ judgment in their selection of the book as a text?
    - If we should, then was it worth firing Dr. Pahl over a book which other CU professors approved of enough to require as a text for their courses?
    - If not, why not? Why don’t we trust these highly-trained men and women as an institution? Shouldn’t they be a resource instead of a feared danger? Does this potential fear have anything to do with Dr. Pahl being dismissed?
- Do all members of the Board of Trustees agree with “each and every position of Cedarville University’s Doctrinal Statement” in the way Dr. Pahl was expected to in order to still be allowed to teach? 
    - If he was dismissed, despite the apparent alignment of his personal views and those expressed in his writing to the Doctrinal Statement, is there a possibility that some of the trustees should also be dismissed according to such strict standards?
- Was Dr. Pahl dismissed for something that wrote which contradicts the Doctrinal Statement? If so, what was it exactly that he wrote? (I have been unable to find anything in *The Beginning and the End*)
- If Dr. Pahl was not fired for something he wrote, was he fired for something that he <u>*didn’t* </u>write? Again, if so, what was it exactly that he didn’t affirm?
- Furthermore, is firing someone for not affirming something fair? Are all professors required to affirm the Doctrinal Statement in its entirety in everything they write and/or publish?
- What is the administration’s vision for the future of the Bible Department at Cedarville University?
- How does firing an orthodox, promising scholar who is committed to Scripture and to the gospel help to achieve that vision?
- Has Dr. Pahl been cared for by the University in any way during this process? As our brother in Christ, have we dismissed him in a way that is honoring to God and helpful to him and his family?
- What explanation has been given to the students who have been affected by Dr. Pahl’s dismissal (i.e. the ones registered for his classes)? Has that explanation been accurate and forthright?
- Are any other professors currently being considered for dismissal by the University for things they have written and published?
