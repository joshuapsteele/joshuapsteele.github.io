I recently came across [a Daniel Pink video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM) that helped clarify and summarize some key insights about finding life's purpose in a really actionable way. The framework was so helpful that I wanted to share it.

**Stop asking "What's my passion?" Start asking better questions.**

Pink suggests that the classic advice to "follow your passion" often leads us nowhere. Instead, he offers seven more practical questions that can actually help you discover your life's purpose.

## The Seven Questions That Matter

**1. What made you weird as a kid?** 
Think back to what you did for fun at 7 or 10 years old, even if others thought it was odd. Those childhood quirks often point to authentic interests that society hasn't yet conditioned out of you.

**2. When do you lose track of time?** 
Notice when you naturally enter a flow state. These moments reveal activities that align with your intrinsic motivation.

**3. What do people consistently thank you for?** 
Ask friends and colleagues: "What do you appreciate about me? What do you think I'm particularly good at? How do you think I'll leave a mark on the world?" Their answers reveal your unique strengths.

**4. What's your sentence?** 
As Clare Boothe Luce once told John F. Kennedy: "A great person is a sentence." Can you summarize your life's purpose in a single, clear sentence?

**5. Where can you make your biggest contribution?** 
Look around at the people, teams, and communities in your life. What do they genuinely need that you're uniquely positioned to provide?

**6. What would you do if money weren't an object?** 
This classic question strips away practical constraints to reveal what truly motivates you.

**7. What will you regret at 90?** 
Most people regret what they *didn't* do—not being bolder, not starting that business, not taking their shot. What three things might your 90-year-old self regret not pursuing? Flip it: What will make you proud to have accomplished?

## The Bottom Line

Purpose isn't something you stumble upon—it's something you actively discover through honest self-reflection. These questions can guide you toward a clearer understanding of what makes your contribution to the world uniquely yours.
