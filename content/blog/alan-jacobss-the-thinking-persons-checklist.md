The following checklist, found on pages 155–56 of Alan Jacobs’s excellent book, [*How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds*](https://amzn.to/33TtBRv) (affiliate link), is a worthy addition to “Rapoport’s Rules” and “Adler’s Advice” (mentioned in my previous post, [“Help me come up with ‘rules for conversation’!”](https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-come-up-with-rules-for-conversation/)).

1. **When faced with provocation to respond to what someone has said, give it five minutes**. Take a walk, or weed the garden, or chop some vegetables. Get your body involved: your body knows the rhythms to live by, and if your mind falls into your body’s rhythm, you’ll have a better chance of thinking.
2. **Value learning over debating**. Don’t “talk for victory.”
3. As best you can, online and off, **avoid the people who fan flames**.
4. Remember that **you don’t have to respond to what everyone else is responding to in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness**.
5. **If you *do* have to respond to what everyone else is responding to** in order to signal your virtue and right-mindedness, or else lose your status in your community, then you should realize that **it’s not a community but rather an [Inner Ring](https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/)**.
6. **Gravitate** as best you can, in every way you can, **toward people who seem to value genuine community and can handle disagreement with equanimity**.
7. **Seek out the best and fairest-minded of people whose views you disagree with.** Listen to them for a time without responding. Whatever they say, *think it over*.
8. Patiently, and as honestly as you can, **assess your [repugnances](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repugnance)**.
9. Sometimes **the “ick factor”** is telling; sometimes it’s a distraction from what matters.
10. Beware of **metaphors** and **myths** that do too much heavy cognitive lifting; notice what your **“[terministic screens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terministic_screen)“** \[See pages 90–91\] are directing your attention to-and what they’re directing your attention *away from*; look closely for hidden metaphors and beware the power of myth.
11. Try to **describe others’ positions in the language that *they* use, without indulging in in-other-wordsing.** \[See pg. 106: “We see it every day. Someone points at an argument—a blog post, say, or an op-ed column—and someone else replies, ‘In other words, you’re saying … ‘ And inevitably the argument, when put *in other words*, is revealed to be vacuous or wicked.\]
12. Be **brave**.
