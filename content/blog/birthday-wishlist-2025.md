It's that time of year again! All the best people were born in October! :) 

As my birthday approaches, I've put together a wishlist of items that I've been eyeing. If you're looking for gift ideas (or if you just want to snag some cool tools for yourself!), here's what I'm hoping for this year:

## Tools

### Affordable Tools

- [WORKPRO 8-Inch Long Nose Slip Joint Pliers](https://amzn.to/3VxPYsc): Really excited to try these affordable pliers. I love my longer slip joint long nose pliers, and I think the 8-inch size will be perfect.
- [Fiskars PowerArc Utility Snips, 8-Inch](https://amzn.to/46TSShi): These scissors look like they can handle anything, and I like that it keeps your hand out of the way in case you're cutting something with a sharp edge.
- [Morakniv Chisel Knife, 3-Inch](https://amzn.to/46yzB3E): Great, affordable chisel knife. I've been wanting one of these for a while.
- [Milescraft Exactor Multifunction Measuring and Marking Tool](https://amzn.to/4mw4qvG): I love how many different features this thing packs into a small package. Will definitely earn a spot in my grab-and-go tool bag.

Also worth mentioning are these two Knipex clones from WORKPRO that I've been wanting to try out:

- [WORKPRO Mini Water Pump Pliers, 4-Inch](https://amzn.to/4807rB5)
- [WORKPRO 7-Inch Pliers Wrench](https://amzn.to/4nSn7ek)

### Some More Expensive Tools

- [Milescraft Portable Drilling Guide](https://amzn.to/4mBe9kH): Apparently this is supposed to "kind of" replace having a full drill press.
- [Knipex Forged Wire Stripper, 8-Inch](https://amzn.to/3IgKfUJ): Yes, this is an expensive wire stripper, but I love Knipex hand tools, and the fact that this one has a wider head that allows you to twist wires together without using lineman's pliers is a big plus. Apparently it's also able to cut screws/bolts like butter.
- [Wera Kraftform Kompakt 26 RA-R Screwdriver](https://amzn.to/46rOvIM): Yes, this is an expensive screwdriver, but I absolutely love they're new ratcheting mechanism, and the fact that this has integrated bit storage makes it perfect.
- [Veto ProPac SP-MC Tool Bag](https://vetopropac.com/sp-mc/): Out of stock right now, but this is my dream tool bag.

## Other Stuff

- Harbor Freight Gift Card: I love Harbor Freight, and can always find something to spend money on there. :)
- Something you think I'd like from [Cool Tools](https://kk.org/cooltools/): I love browsing through this site, and there's always something interesting.
- Something you think I'd like from [JetPens](https://www.jetpens.com/): I love pens, pencils, and other stationery items.
