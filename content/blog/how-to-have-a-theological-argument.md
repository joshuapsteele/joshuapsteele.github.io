Tired of hearing Christians go nuclear over a verse in Revelation or a line from Genesis? Me too. We can do better. (Note: I've frequently failed at this myself, so consider this a reminder for me as much as for you.)

Here’s how to have a theological argument without losing your cool — or your brother or sister in Christ.

## 1. The Problem: Why Most Theological Arguments Go Sideways

Most bad theological arguments have the same ingredients:

- **Overconfidence + under-preparation**: reading one book or hearing one sermon doesn’t make you an expert.
- **Passion outrunning humility**: loving your opinion more than you love the truth.
- **Confusing essentials with non-essentials**: acting like disagreement over the millennium is a gospel dealbreaker.
- **Fighting to win, not to understand**: turning the Bible into ammo.

**Example**: Two Christians on Facebook spend three hours arguing about whether “the days” in Genesis 1 are 24-hour periods. Or maybe it's about pre-tribulation vs. post-tribulation rapture, Calvinism vs. Arminianism, or Nebuchadnezzar's blood type. I don't know. By the end, neither is listening, both are angry, and their friends are quietly unfollowing them. That’s not contending for the faith — that’s contending for ego.

## 2. The Landscape: What You’re Actually Stepping Into

When you step into any theological debate, you’re not just sparring over one verse. You’re entering a centuries-old conversation involving:

- **Biblical studies** — the original languages, historical settings, and literary forms.
- **Church history** — how Christians have interpreted and applied the text before us.
- **Systematic theology** — connecting doctrines into a coherent whole.
- **Practical theology** — how belief translates into action.

Reality check: you will *never* know everything. And that’s OK. The sooner you embrace that, the freer you are to learn.

## 3. The Tools: Basics of Responsible Interpretation

You don’t need a seminary degree to argue well, but you do need to know the basics.

**1. Context is king**  
A verse only makes sense in light of the chapter, the book, and the historical moment it came from. Philippians 4:13 is about enduring hardship in Christ, not about winning your next tennis match.

**2. Genre matters**  
Poetry, historical narrative, parable, prophecy, apocalypse — each plays by different rules. Treating Psalm 23 like a history textbook is as unhelpful as treating 1 Samuel like a haiku.

**3. Original audience first**  
The Bible wasn’t written *to* you, though it is written *for* you. What did the message mean to the first hearers before you apply it to your life? If you think a passage means something that would have made no sense whatsoever to its original audience, you’re probably off track.

**4. Scripture interprets Scripture**  
The Bible is a unified story. Let the whole counsel of God inform how you read each part. That means comparing texts, not isolating them. 

A corollary: **don’t use obscure verses to overturn clear teaching elsewhere**. That weird verse in Revelation doesn’t nullify Jesus’ clear command to love your neighbor.

**5. Church history is a resource**  
You’re not the first to wrestle with Revelation or Romans. The creeds, confessions, and commentaries of past centuries are tools, not shackles.

**6. Tradition and reason**  
The Spirit works through the church’s collective wisdom and through sound thinking. Don’t ignore either.

**7. Translation awareness**  
Every English Bible is already an interpretation. If you don't know how to do research in the original languages, (1) acknowledge that limitation, and (2) at least compare several English versions when things get tricky.

- **Michael Bird**, *Evangelical Theology* — a rich, readable introduction to the big-picture framework of Christian doctrine.
- **N.T. Wright**, *Scripture and the Authority of God* — how the Bible works as God’s Word in the church today.
- **Fleming Rutledge**, *The Crucifixion* — a masterclass in tying biblical interpretation to the center of the gospel.

## 4. The Skills: How to Argue Without Hating Each Other

**Ask clarifying questions** before assuming. Too often we respond to what we think someone said instead of what they actually meant. Slow down. Ask, “When you say ‘literal,’ what do you mean?” You might discover you agree on more than you realized.

**Summarize their view** until they say, “Yes, that’s what I mean.” This is called steel-manning, and it forces you to listen carefully and represent their position fairly before critiquing it. If you can’t explain their argument clearly, you’re not ready to refute it.

**Admit what you don’t know** without shame. “I haven’t read enough on that to have a strong opinion” is a mark of intellectual honesty, not weakness. This humility models teachability and keeps discussions from devolving into bluffing contests.

**Distinguish doctrine tiers** so you don’t treat secondary matters like salvation issues. Essentials are the gospel truths all Christians affirm; convictions are important but not dealbreakers; preferences are personal or cultural. Knowing the difference changes the temperature of your debates.

Note: Doing this kind of "theological triage" is itself a skill that takes time to develop. When in doubt, err on the side of charity. It's all too easy to misjudge what counts as essential via "all or nothing" or "slippery slope" thinking.

**Separate people from positions.** Disagree with ideas, not identities. A person’s worth isn’t defined by whether they agree with your interpretation of Revelation 20. You might be wrong, and they might be right — or vice versa. And that's OK. Remember that we’re all on a journey of faith and understanding.

**Mind the context** every time you engage. In person, watch your tone and body language — they communicate as much as your words. Online, assume tone will be misunderstood and over-clarify. Across age and cultural lines, listen first and respect the other person’s experience before offering your rebuttal.

## 5. The Pitfalls: Common Fallacies & Biases to Avoid

- **Straw man** — misrepresenting their view so it’s easier to attack.  
  *E.g.*, “So you’re saying Genesis is just a myth?” (when they never said that).
- **Ad hominem** — attacking the person instead of the argument.  
  *E.g.*, “You just believe that because you went to a liberal seminary.”
- **Proof-texting** — quoting a verse without context.  
  *E.g.*, using Jeremiah 29:11 as a personal life guarantee without reading vv. 1–10.
- **Confirmation bias** — only reading sources that agree with you.
- **Slippery slope** — “If you affirm women preaching, you’ll deny the resurrection next.”
- **False dilemma** — “Either you believe in six-day creation or you reject the Bible.”

Naming these doesn’t make you immune, but it does make you more alert.

## 6. The Better Way: Theological Debate as a Spiritual Discipline

This isn’t just about sharpening your intellect. It’s about deepening your discipleship.

- **Love is the foundation** (1 Cor. 13). If your words aren’t loving, they’re just noise.
- **Seek truth, not points** — the goal isn’t to “win” but to walk away wiser.
- **Rely on the Spirit** — insight is a gift, not a personal conquest.
- **Remember your family** — the person you’re debating is your sibling in Christ, not your enemy.

Acts 15 shows us disagreement handled well: listening, deliberating, and seeking consensus in the Spirit.

## 7. The Checklist: Non-Negotiables for Healthy Theological Debate

**Be humble** — you might be wrong.  
**Be curious** — ask more questions than you answer.  
**Be charitable** — assume the best intentions.  
**Be informed** — do your homework.  
**Be patient** — understanding takes time.  
**Be loving** — if you “win” the argument but lose the person, you’ve lost.

**TL;DR: Takeaways**  
Theology is family talk. Bring your best thinking, your deepest humility, and your fiercest love. Remember: the goal is not to destroy your opponent, but to better understand God and His Word — together.
