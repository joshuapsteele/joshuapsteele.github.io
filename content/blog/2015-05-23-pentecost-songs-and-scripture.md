Listening to [the first episode](http://homebrewedchristianity.com/2015/05/18/pentecost-the-arrival-of-the-spirit-and-the-lectiocast/) of the excellent new podcast, [LectioCast](http://www.jrdkirk.com/2015/05/14/lectiocast-a-lectionary-commentary-podcast/), helped to orient my thoughts toward [tomorrow’s readings](http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/) for [Pentecost Sunday](http://www.christiantoday.com/article/nine.key.things.to.know.about.pentecost/54344.htm). I’ve reproduced the first lesson, psalm, second lesson, and Gospel reading below, but I’d also like to call your attention to three powerful songs.

## Song #1: “Dry Bones” by Gungor

The first song is “Dry Bones” by Gungor. Read the Ezekiel passage and psalm below, and give it a listen.

### First Lesson: Ezekiel 37:1-14 (NET Bible)

*The Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones – Gustave Dore*

> 37 The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and placed me in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones.  
> 2 He made me walk all around among them. I realized there were a great many bones in the valley and they were very dry.  
> 3 He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said to him, “Sovereign Lord, you know.”  
> 4 Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.  
> 5 This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones: Look, I am about to infuse breath into you and you will live.  
> 6 I will put tendons on you and muscles over you and will cover you with skin; I will put breath in you and you will live. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Psalm 104:24-34 (NET Bible)

> 24 How many living things you have made, O Lord!  
> You have exhibited great skill in making all of them;  
> the earth is full of the living things you have made.  
> 
> 25 Over here is the deep, wide sea,  
> which teems with innumerable swimming creatures,  
> living things both small and large.  
> 
> 26 The ships travel there,  
> and over here swims the whale you made to play in it.  
> 
> 27 All of your creatures wait for you  
> to provide them with food on a regular basis.  
> 
> 28 You give food to them and they receive it;  
> you open your hand and they are filled with food.  
> 
> 29 When you ignore them, they panic.  
> When you take away their life’s breath, they die  
> and return to dust.  
> 
> 30 When you send your life-giving breath, they are created,  
> and you replenish the surface of the ground.  
> 
> 31 May the splendor of the Lord endure!  
> May the Lord find pleasure in the living things he has made!  
> 
> 32 He looks down on the earth and it shakes;  
> he touches the mountains and they start to smolder.  
> 
> 33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;  
> I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist!  
> 
> 34 May my thoughts be pleasing to him!  
> I will rejoice in the Lord.  

## Song #2: “Tongues of Fire” by John Mark McMillan

### Second Lesson: Acts 2:1-21 (NET Bible)

![Pentecôte by Jean II Restout](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Jean_II_Restout_-_Pentec%C3%B4te.jpg/800px-Jean_II_Restout_-_Pentec%C3%B4te.jpg)
*Pentecôte by Jean II Restout*

> 2 Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.  
> 2 Suddenly a sound like a violent wind blowing came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting.  
> 3 And tongues spreading out like a fire appeared to them and came to rest on each one of them.  
> 4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.  
> 
> 5 Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem.  
> 6 When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.  
> 7 Completely baffled, they said, “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?  
> 8 And how is it that each one of us hears them in our own native language?  
> 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia,  
> 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,  
> 11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own languages about the great deeds God has done!”

## Song #3: “Holy Ghost” by John Mark McMillan

The third song is “Holy Ghost” by John Mark McMillan. Give it a listen, read the remaining reading, and have a blessed Pentecost!

### Gospel: John 15:26-27, 16:4b-15 (NET Bible)

> 26 When the Advocate comes, whom I will send you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me,  
> 27 and you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.  
> 
> 5 But now I am going to the one who sent me, and not one of you is asking me, ‘Where are you going?’  
> 6 Instead your hearts are filled with sadness because I have said these things to you.  
> 7 But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you.  
> 13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth.
