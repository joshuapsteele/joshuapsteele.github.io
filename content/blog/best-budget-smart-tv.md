In November 2024, I bought a [55-inch Hisense U6 4K Smart TV](https://amzn.to/3C4AoOG) on sale for $350. It's been great so far! Definitely an upgrade over our old Samsung.

I'm not a TV expert, but I did a fair bit of research and the consensus seems to be that the Hisense U6 series is a great deal for the money.
