*(to the tune of [“The Fate of Ophelia” by Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko70cExuzZM))*

**[Verse 1]**
I heard you whisper on the megaphone
You said the shots were all a hoax
As legend has it, you were nearly gone
But here you are, back in the throat

**[Pre-Chorus]**
And if the doctors quit on me
We’ll see a nineteenth-century repeat
I swore my loyalty to facts (Facts), the vax (The vax), and I (I)
Right before the truth got quiet

**[Chorus]**
All that time
We lived in herd immunity
Now we’ve got lost opportunity
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You crawled up out of the past and
Claimed a world that forgot the
[Diphtheria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria) (Diphtheria)

**[Post-Chorus]**
Keep it one hundred in the labs (Labs), the wards (Wards), the news
Pledge allegiance to your clicks, your grift, your views
Don’t care where the germs have been (Been), ‘cause now (Now), they fly
It’s 'bout to be the viral night you’ve been dreaming of
The fate of Diphtheria

**[Verse 2]**
The eldest daughter of the plague and cough
You ruled the air ‘til immunity
But lies are a warm bed full of algorithms
And ignorance breeds insanity

**[Pre-Chorus]**
And if the funding's cut from me (Cut from me)
We’ll lose the [GAVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI) cavalry
You spread like wildfire through the feed (The feed), the thread (The thread), the lie (The lie)
All because [some man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.) denied it

**[Chorus]**
All that time
We lived in herd immunity
Now we’ve lost opportunity
I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You crawled up out of the past and
Claimed a world that moved past the
Diphtheria (Diphtheria)

**[Post-Chorus]**
Keep it one hundred in the labs (Labs), the wards (The wards), the news
Pledge allegiance to your clicks (Your clicks), your grift, your views
Don’t care where the truth has been (Has been), 'cause now ('Cause now), you lie
It’s 'bout to be the fever dream you’ve been scheming-up
The fate of Diphtheria

**[Bridge]**
Locked inside our memory
A cure became conspiracy
We stopped the shots, we set you free
All because of vanity
Locked inside our memory
The science lost its clarity
You came back laughing, mockingly
All because of apathy...

---

**[Chorus]**
All that time
We lived in herd immunity
Now we’ve got lost opportunity
Now I can see it all (I can see it all)
Late one night
You crawled up out of the past and
Claimed a world that moved past the
Diphtheria (Diphtheria)

**[Post-Chorus]**
Keep it one hundred in the labs (Labs), the wards (The wards), the news
Pledge allegiance to your clicks (Your clicks), your grift, your views
Don’t care where the germs have been (They’ve been), 'cause now ('Cause now), they fly
It’s 'bout to be the fever dream we’ve been waking from
The fate of Diphtheria

**[Outro, softly]**
The fate of Diphtheria...
All because they stopped believing...
All because we stopped the healing...
The fate of Diphtheria...
