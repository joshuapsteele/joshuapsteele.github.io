---

Based upon my own reading of Bonhoeffer’s [*Letters and Papers from Prison* \[DBWE 8\]](https://amzn.to/2AuzaJj), here is my attempt at a summary list of the facets/aspects of Bonhoeffer’s view of “religion” in prison.

1. Religion emphasizes inwardness. \[DBWE 8:362, 364, 455–57\]
2. Religion emphasizes conscience. \[DBWE 8:362\]
3. Religion is a temporary phenomenon. \[DBWE 8:362, 364\]
4. Religion is manipulative and exploitative. \[DBWE 8:363, 366, 426–27, 450, 455–57\]
5. Religion ignores human strength/knowledge/autonomy and instead focuses on human weakness, ignorance, and boundaries/limits/limitations. \[DBWE 8:366, 405–7, 426–27, 450, 455–57, 475–78\]
6. Religion is metaphysical, otherworldly, and escapist. \[DBWE 8:364, 372–73, 447–48, 480, 485–86, 501\]
7. Religion is privileged. \[DBWE 8:364\]
8. Religion is, like circumcision, no longer a condition for salvation. \[DBWE 8:365–66\]
9. Religion posits a false “God” (a “deus ex machina,” “working hypothesis,” and “stopgap”) on the other side of human boundaries (a shrinking area, as humanity matures) in order to solve human problems. \[DBWE 8:366, 405–7, 426–27, 450, 455–57, 475–80, 500–1\]
10. Religion is driven by anxiety. \[DBWE 8:366, 478\]
11. Religion is individualistic. \[DBWE 8:372–73\]
12. Religious language has lost its power.\[DBWE 8:390\]
13. Religion is a particular posture towards life, capable of being exemplified, not only by pastors, but also by existential philosophers and psychotherapists. \[DBWE 8:427, 450, 457\]
14. Religion is a partial and segmented posture towards life. \[DBWE 8:455–57, 482\]
15. Religion ignores the world’s increasing godlessness. \[DBWE 8:480, 482\]
