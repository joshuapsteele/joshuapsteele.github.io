There are better preachers out there. So, if you’re short on time, go and listen to them! However, if you’ve got 26 minutes to spare, I offer “The Challenge of Christmas Light” to you, and would love to hear your feedback.

I preached this sermon on December 27, 2015 at [St. Peter’s Anglican Church](http://stpetersbhm.org/) in Mountain Brook, AL, as we celebrated the [Feast of St. John the Apostle and Evangelist](http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearABC/HolyDays/John.html).

My sermon text was that day’s Gospel lesson, [1 John 1:1-9, expanded to include 2:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A1-2%3A2&version=ESV). But I also reference the Old Testament lesson, [Exodus 33:18-23](http://www.lectionarypage.net/YearABC/HolyDays/John.html#ot1).

You can read the sermon manuscript here: [The Challenge of Christmas Light Sermon Manuscript](https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-challenge-of-christmas-light-st-john-2015.pdf "The Challenge of Christmas Light Sermon Manuscript").

And you can listen to the audio here (note: it begins just as I finish reading the collect for the Feast of St. John and the collect for the First Sunday after Christmas):
