Great news! The first ever guest post on this blog is coming soon from my good friend Amy Chase, an incoming student this Fall at [Asbury Theological Seminary](http://www.asburyseminary.edu/).

Her post? A sermon titled **“[Jeremiah 29:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2029:11&version=NET), Scripture: Handle with Care.”**

Stay tuned!
