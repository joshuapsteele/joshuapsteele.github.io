> 
> Bless those who are young and in health, that they may give the days of their strength to you.
> 
> Comfort the aged and infirm, that your peace may rest upon them.
> 
> Hallow the ties of kindred, that we may help and not hinder one another in all the good works that you have prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
