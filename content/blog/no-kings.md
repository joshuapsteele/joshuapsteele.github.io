No kings, save One, the King of Kings,  
whose kingdom peace and justice brings.  

No kings, but He who blessed the poor,  
and binds their wounds forevermore.  

No kings, except the Crucified,  
who, on a tyrant's cross, died --  

No kings! -- to save the last, the least,  
and bring them to His wedding feast.  

No kings, save One, who wore a crown  
of bitter thorns upon His brow.  

No kings, but He who rose to save,  
to lift the outcasts from their grave.  

No kings, except the Refugee,  
who came to set the captives free.  

No kings, no tyrants, on their thrones,  
they'll be cast down by One alone --  

No kings! -- whose kingdom is not of this age,  
whose war is not by violence waged.  

No kings, but He who'll come again  
to right the bloodstained wrongs of men.  

So, kings, so, despots, bend the knee!  
Fear Him who sets your prisoners free.  

No, kings, One saves! His freedom rings!  
No kings, save One, the King of Kings.
