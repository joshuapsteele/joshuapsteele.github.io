title: It's Time to Get Some Help

Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I’ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.

Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and *trapped* often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.

I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!

However, as I see it, I’m writing it out here for two reasons:

1. **To commit publicly to seeking out counseling** now that I’ve started my first try of medication.
2. **In case anyone else out there**, currently experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, etc., **needs a nudge to seek out help sooner rather than later**.

If #2 above refers to you, please know that you’re not alone! Please don’t let pride or anything else get in the way of receiving the help that you need.
