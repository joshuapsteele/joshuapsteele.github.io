title: Down With the Pacifists!

The past week has been a great one for slipshod attacks on pacifism. First, from [First Things](http://www.firstthings.com/) (Stephen H. Webb) on October 15 —- [“John Howard Yoder and the Violent Power of Pacifism”](http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/10/john-howard-yoder-and-the-violent-power-of-pacifism) (emphasis added below):

“Nevertheless, pacifists, at least the ones I know, can be very enthusiastic about the rightness of their cause. Since <span style="text-decoration:underline;">there is no rational justification for pacifism</span>, defenders typically turn their rhetoric against their critics by casting them as stooges of the status quo. Since pacifists are against all forms of violence, anyone who disagrees with them must be in favor of violence. What this ploy misses is obvious. In a fallen world, not only is violence pervasive but it is also a toxin that, when legitimately used, can cure as well as kill.

\[…\]

“So we now know that \[John Howard\] Yoder was a violent man who believed so wholeheartedly in his own non-violent theology that he thought he could re-order human sexual relations. This single case does not invalidate pacifism, but it does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reveal just how delusional the pacifist goal can be. The pursuit of peace at all costs is just as dangerous as any other dream that cuts against the realities of human nature</span>.”

Exactly one week later, [Mark Driscoll](http://theresurgence.com/authors/mark-driscoll) came out with this gem, [“Is God a Pacifist?”](http://theresurgence.com/2013/10/22/is-god-a-pacifist):

## **“JESUS IS NOT A PANSY OR A PACIFIST** 

“One of the defining attributes of God’s coming kingdom is *shalom*—perfect peace untainted by sin, violence, or bloodshed of any sort. Such a kingdom is only possible if an all-powerful, benevolent Authority vanquishes his enemies. In other words, the Prince of Peace is not a pacifist.

“God is the author of life and sovereign over death.

“Those who want to portray Jesus as a pansy or a pacifist are prone to be very selective in the parts of the Bible they quote. But the God of the bloody Old Testament is Jesus Christ. When he became a man, he walked the earth as a working-class carpenter. The European, long-haired, dress-wearing, hippie Jesus is a bad myth from a bad artist who mistook Jesus for a community college humanities professor. But if we want to learn all about Jesus we have to read all that the Bible says about him. Here’s how Jesus will appear one day:” \[Proceeds to quote his favorite Bible passage, [Revelation 14:14-20](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rev.%2014.14%E2%80%9320).\]

**What about you? What’s your take on pacifism? And, if you’re going to critique it, please do a better job than Driscoll &amp; Co.!**
