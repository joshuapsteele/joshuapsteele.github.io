I’m really interested in using [Ryan Holiday’s/Robert Greene’s index card system](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/12/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-everything-you-read/).

Does anyone else out there use such a notecard system? If so, what do you use to store your index cards? I’m looking for a sturdy box to use for filing cards.
