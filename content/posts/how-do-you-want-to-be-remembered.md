Do you know what the worst thing about _**death**_ is?

It's not the dying itself - its the **separation**.

That is, we don't suffer the most from our own deaths (a one-time occurrence), but from suffering the deaths of others (repeatedly). Instead of living relationships, we are left with distant memories.

A sad reality, to be sure.

### What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage?

I'm convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 -

> It is better to go to a house of mourningthan to go to a house of feasting,for death is the destiny of everyone;the living should take this to heart.

Now, obviously, simply taking death to heart isn't enough to defeat our most ancient enemy. For that, we need (and have been given) a _**resurrection**_.

But, have you taken your own death to heart? I believe there's something to be gained by considering how you'd like to be remembered by others after you die.

## How do you want to be remembered:

- ## by God?

- ## by your spouse?

- ## by your children?

- ## by your parents?

- ## by your family and friends?

- ## by your colleagues?

For me, I'd like to be remembered:

- ...as God's faithful servant.
- ...as my wife's best friend.
- ...as my children's most important teacher.
- ...as my parents' legacy.
- ...as my family and friends' loyal brother.
- ...as my colleagues inspiring teammate.

...which sounds great, right? But here's the rub:

## What changes do you and I need to make in our lives, to start making those hypothetical memories more realistic each day?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this in the comments below, as I consider how taking death to heart should impact one's entire life.
