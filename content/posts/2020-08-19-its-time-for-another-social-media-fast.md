After listening to [the Blinkist summary of Cal Newport’s *Deep Work*](https://www.blinkist.com/en/books/deep-work-en) (I’ve read the book, this was just for a refresher), I’m convinced that it’s time for another 30-day fast from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

I think I’ll still keep [my micro.blog up and running](https://micro.blog/joshuapsteele), but between [running Anglican Compass](https://anglicancompass.com) and [sprinting for some last-ditch clarity on my increasingly frustrating dissertation](https://joshuapsteele.com/the-phd-plan-or-the-lack-thereof/), I need all the extra bandwidth I can get!

If you need to get in touch for some reason, please [use the contact form on my website](https://joshuapsteele.com/contact/). You can also [sign up for my very occasional email newsletter here](https://buttondown.email/joshuapsteele).

One last thing: If you haven’t read [Cal Newport’s *Deep Work*](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) yet, you should do so ASAP!
