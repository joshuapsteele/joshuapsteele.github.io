The following is an original Mother's Day poem of mine, that I wrote for my mom (the best mom ever, of course) back in 2009. It's called "From a Grateful Son," and I hope that you enjoy it.

## From a Grateful Son - A Poem for My Mother

Thank you, Mom, for having me
that day so long ago.
Thank you, then, for holding me
and now for letting go.
Thank you, Mom, for giving me
your patience, time, and care.
And thank you, Mom, for loving me
for always being there –

Thanks so much for teaching me
both how to read and write.
For every single grueling day
and every sleepless night.
Thank you, Mom, for aiming high,
for helping me succeed.
For never letting me forget
that you believe in me.

Mom, you mean so much to me.
My words cannot convey
The debt of love, of care-filled work
That I should rightly pay.
Though distance, time, and life itself
may take me far away,
I'll always be your little boy
with these three words to say –

“I love you.”
