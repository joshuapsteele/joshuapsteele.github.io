...and by "club" I of course mean "Church"!

What am I getting at? Am I calling the Church a mere "club"?

No. Although, unfortunately, it often feels that way, doesn't it?

- A club full of hypocrisy, idolatry, indifference, and platitudes.
- A club full of power-plays, fear-mongering, and Bible-thumping.
- A club full of saints too afraid to admit that they are sinners.

Perhaps you're sick of this "club," and you're ready to leave, if you haven't left already.

I'm asking you to stay. To come back. To join for the first time.

Why?

Because the Church must be composed of people who realize the Church's shortcomings and failures.

Otherwise, itÂ _**is**_ **just a club.**

I'm asking you to stay, because most leaders within the Church share your frustrations.

Because the strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community.

And because, as I'll talk about tomorrow, you're part of the problems. And so am I.

So, let's work toward solving them together. Within the Church.
