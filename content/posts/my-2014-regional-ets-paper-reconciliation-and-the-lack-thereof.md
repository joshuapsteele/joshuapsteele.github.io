If you're interested, here's [the latest version of the Regional ETS paper](/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/steele-southeast-ets-2014-paper-final-presesntation-edit.pdf) I will present today at 5:00pm at Beeson Divinity School, room S009.

If you're able to attend the presentation, that's great! If not, feel free to give [my paper](/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/steele-southeast-ets-2014-paper-final-presesntation-edit.pdf) a read and get back to me with any questions, comments, or suggestions. Atonement theology and the unity of the Church are two things about which I am very passionate, and intend to devote further study to these areas in the future.

Thanks

~Josh
