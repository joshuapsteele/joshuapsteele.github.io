Hi internet - especially all you Barthians and Bonhoefferians (-ites?) out there.

I'm in the process of compiling a reading list, and I could use your suggestions.

Here's my goal: **to explore the possible relationship between Barth's critique of the "No-God"**(Nich-Gott) **and Bonhoeffer's critique(s) of viewing God as a "stopgap"** (Lückenbüßer) **or "working hypothesis."**

As far as primary sources go, I plan to focus on the _Romans_ commentary, [Garrett Green's recent re-translation of](http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098) [_CD_](http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098) [§17](http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098), and _Letters and Papers from Prison_.

As for secondary sources, right now I'm starting the list with [Tom Greggs' **_Theology Against Religion_**](http://www.amazon.com/Theology-against-Religion-Constructive-Bonhoeffer/dp/0567104230/). I've read this twice now, and it has been a major inspiration for the project.

I've also got my eye on [Michael DeJonge's **_Bonhoeffer's Theological Formation_**,](http://www.amazon.com/Bonhoeffers-Theological-Formation-Protestant-Theology/dp/0199639787/) [Ernst Feil's **_The Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer_**](http://www.amazon.com/Theology-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Ernst-Feil/dp/0800662407/), [Andreas Pangritz's **_Karl Barth in the Theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer_**](http://www.amazon.com/Karl-Barth-Theology-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer/dp/080284281X/), and [Jeffrey Pugh's **_Religionless Christianity_**](http://www.amazon.com/Religionless-Christianity-Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Troubled/dp/0567032590/).

I'm also working my way through [Sven Ensminger's **_Karl Barth's Theology as a Resource for a Christian Theology of Religions_**](http://www.amazon.com/Theology-Resource-Christian-Religions-Systematic/dp/0567666727/). While this looks very helpful for a larger project on Barth, Bonhoeffer, and the theological critique of religion, **I'm still looking for sources that deal more directly with Barth's "No-God" and Bonhoeffer's God as "stopgap" or "working hypothesis."**

### _**Do you have any reading recommendations for me?**_

OR, even better: Have any of you translated Hans-Joachim Kraus' _**[Theologische Religionskritik](http://www.amazon.com/Theologische-Religionskritik-Neukirchener-systematischen-Theologie/dp/3788706724/)**_ into English yet? Because that would be fantastic.
