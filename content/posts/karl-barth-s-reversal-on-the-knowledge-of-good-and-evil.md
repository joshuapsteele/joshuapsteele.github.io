title: Karl Barth's Reversal on the "Knowledge of Good and Evil"

I argue that, although Barth’s interpretation of the Genesis passages changed between [_The Epistle to the Romans_](https://amzn.to/2SVxH69) and the [_Church Dogmatics_](https://www.logos.com/product/5758/barths-church-dogmatics), his mature readings of Genesis 2–3 still support his overall theological critique of religion as idolatry, the self-justifying positing of false gods.

Specifically, in _Romans_ (240–57, esp. 246–51), Barth interpreted “the knowledge of good and evil” as the divine secret that humans are merely humans.

- The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby concealed the creator/creature distinction
- and was meant to enable a direct relationship between God and humans.
- Instead, human disobedience revealed the distinction
- and led to the rise of religion as worship of God, an independent action over against their creator.

In the _Church Dogmatics_ (esp. CD III/1, 257–76, but also IV/1, 418–78), Barth interpreted the knowledge of good and evil as God’s prerogative to judge between what ought to be and what ought not to be.

- The prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby revealed the creator/creature distinction
- and was meant to prompt humans to acknowledge and praise their creator—to worship God in a proper way.
- Instead, humans disobediently attempted to abolish the distinction.
- This led to the rise of religion as improper worship—the self-exalting, self-justifying, and self-helping positing of false gods.
