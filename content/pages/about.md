## Joshua P. Steele, "The Rev. Dev."

This is a test of the GitHub action to deploy and update my site.

I'm Josh Steele, a pastor-turned-programmer ("Rev\[erend\]"-to-"Dev\[eloper\]") who solves problems with a programmer's eye for detail and a pastor's heart for people.

As a software engineer, I work mainly on backend development in Java for a cybersecurity company. But I'm also an ordained Anglican priest (currently [resigned from active ministry](/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/)) with three Bible/theology degrees.

Currently living in Toledo, OH, I've got a wife, three young children, and an addiction to buying books and tools.

If you'd like to learn more about me, check out:

- My [**/resume**](/portfolio/cv/) (and here's my LinkedIn profile)
- My [**/blog**](/blog/)
- The [**/tools**](/resources/) I use
