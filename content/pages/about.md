"The Rev. Dev." I'm Josh Steele, a pastor-turned-programmer ("Rev\[erend\]"-to-"Dev\[eloper\]") who solves problems with a programmer's eye for detail and a pastor's heart for people.

As a software engineer, I work mainly on backend development in Java for a cybersecurity company. But I'm also an ordained Anglican priest (currently [resigned from active ministry](/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/)) with three Bible/theology degrees.

Currently living in Toledo, OH, I've got a wife, three young children, and an addiction to buying books and tools.

This is my main personal website, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/joshuapsteele/joshuapsteele.github.io).
