I'm Josh Steele, a pastor-turned-programmer who solves problems with a heart for people and an eye for detail.

As a software engineer, I work mainly on backend development in Java, SQL, and Python for a cybersecurity company. 

But I'm also an ordained Anglican priest (currently [resigned from active ministry](/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/)), trying to figure out what, if anything, to do with my Holy Orders and three degrees in theology.

After a long time away (for those theology degrees), I'm back in Ohio, where I live with my wife and three young children.

In my free time (what's that?), I buy books and tools...and then try to find even more time to use them. Recently, DIY home repair projects have been a welcome change of pace from spending all day looking at a screen. I'm trying to become competent in as many different practical skills as possible. (You know, since I studied *theology* in school! Haha.)

This is my main personal website, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/joshuapsteele/joshuapsteele.github.io).
