## An Outline of the Christian Faith

*This enhanced catechism draws primarily from [the Book of Common Prayer (1979), Episcopal Church (USA), pages 843–862](https://www.bcponline.org/Misc/catechism.html), with supplementary material from [the Church of England's 1662 Book of Common Prayer](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer/catechism), modernized and noted accordingly.*

---

## Concerning the Catechism

This catechism is primarily intended for use by parish priests, deacons, and lay catechists, to give an outline for instruction. It is a commentary on [the creeds](#the-creeds), but is not meant to be a complete statement of belief and practices; rather, it is a point of departure for the teacher, and it is cast in the traditional question and answer form for ease of reference.

The second use of this catechism is to provide a brief summary of the Church's teaching for an inquiring stranger who picks up a Prayer Book.

It may also be used to form a simple service; since the matter is arranged under headings, it is suitable for selective use, and the leader may introduce prayers and hymns as needed.

## Baptismal Identity

> *The following section derives from the Church of England's 1662 Book of Common Prayer, here rendered in modern language.*

### What is your name?

*[Here the person states their baptismal name.]*

### Who gave you this name?

My godparents gave it to me at my [baptism](#holy-baptism), in which I was made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.

### What did your godparents promise on your behalf?

They made three promises in my name. 

- First, that I would renounce the devil and all his works, the empty show of this world, and all the sinful desires of the flesh. 
- Second, that I would believe all [the articles of the Christian faith](#the-creeds). 
- And third, that I would keep [God's holy will and commandments](#the-ten-commandments), and walk in the same all the days of my life.

### Do you consider yourself bound to believe and do what they promised for you?

Yes, truly, and by God's help I will. I thank our heavenly Father that he has called me to this state of salvation through Jesus Christ our Savior. And I pray that God will give me grace to continue in the same to my life's end.

## Human Nature

### What are we by nature?

We are part of God's creation, made in the image of God.

### What does it mean to be created in the image of God?

It means that we are free to make choices: to love, to create, to reason, and to live in harmony with creation and with God.

### Why then do we live apart from God and out of harmony with creation?

From the beginning, human beings have misused their freedom and made wrong choices.

### Why do we not use our freedom as we should?

Because we rebel against God, and we put ourselves in the place of God.

### What help is there for us?

Our help is in God.

### How did God first help us?

God first helped us by revealing himself and his will, through nature and history, through many seers and saints, and especially the prophets of Israel.

---

## God the Father

### What do we learn about God as creator from the revelation to Israel?

We learn that there is one God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.

### What does this mean?

This means that the universe is good, that it is the work of a single loving God who creates, sustains, and directs it.

### What does this mean about our place in the universe?

It means that the world belongs to its creator; and that we are called to enjoy it and to care for it in accordance with God's purposes.

### What does this mean about human life?

It means that all people are worthy of respect and honor, because all are created in the image of God, and all can respond to the love of God.

### How was this revelation handed down to us?

This revelation was handed down to us through a community created by a covenant with God.

---

## The Old Covenant

### What is meant by a covenant with God?

A covenant is a relationship initiated by God, to which a body of people responds in faith.

### What is the Old Covenant?

The Old Covenant is the one given by God to the Hebrew people.

### What did God promise them?

God promised that they would be his people to bring all the nations of the world to him.

### What response did God require from the chosen people?

God required the chosen people to be faithful; to love justice, to do mercy, and to walk humbly with their God.

### Where is this Old Covenant to be found?

The covenant with the Hebrew people is to be found in the books which we call the Old Testament.

### Where in the Old Testament is God's will for us shown most clearly?

God's will for us is shown most clearly in the Ten Commandments.

---

## The Ten Commandments

### What are the Ten Commandments?

The Ten Commandments are the laws given to Moses and the people of Israel.

{{< callout "note" >}}
*The following presentation of the Commandments derives from the Church of England's 1662 Book of Common Prayer, here rendered in modern language.*

> These are the words God spoke in the twentieth chapter of Exodus: "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
> 
> **I.** You shall have no other gods but me.
> 
> **II.** You shall not make for yourself any idol, nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them.
> 
> **III.** You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.
> 
> **IV.** Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, your son, your daughter, your servants, your animals, and the stranger within your gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
> 
> **V.** Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you.
> 
> **VI.** You shall not murder.
> 
> **VII.** You shall not commit adultery.
> 
> **VIII.** You shall not steal.
> 
> **IX.** You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
> 
> **X.** You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his servant, nor his animals, nor anything that is his.

### What do we learn from these commandments?

We learn two things: our duty to God, and our duty to our neighbors.

### What is our duty to God?

Our duty is to believe and trust in God;

1. To love and obey God and to bring others to know him;
2. To put nothing in the place of God;
3. To show God respect in thought, word, and deed;
4. And to set aside regular times for worship, prayer, and the study of God's ways.

{{< callout "note" >}}
*The 1662 Book of Common Prayer offers this expanded answer, here in modern language:*

My duty toward God is 

- to believe in him, 
- to fear him, 
- and to love him with all my heart, with all my mind, with all my soul, and with all my strength; 
- to worship him, 
- to give him thanks, 
- to put my whole trust in him, 
- to call upon him, 
- to honor his holy name and his Word, 
- and to serve him truly all the days of my life.
{{< /callout >}}

### What is our duty to our neighbors?

Our duty to our neighbors is to love them as ourselves, and to do to other people as we wish them to do to us;

5. To love, honor, and help our parents and family; to honor those in authority, and to meet their just demands;
6. To show respect for the life God has given us; to work and pray for peace; to bear no malice, prejudice, or hatred in our hearts; and to be kind to all the creatures of God;
7. To use our bodily desires as God intended;
8. To be honest and fair in our dealings; to seek justice, freedom, and the necessities of life for all people; and to use our talents and possessions as ones who must answer for them to God;
9. To speak the truth, and not to mislead others by our silence;
10. To resist temptations to envy, greed, and jealousy; to rejoice in other people's gifts and graces; and to do our duty for the love of God, who has called us into fellowship with him.

{{< callout "note" >}}
*The 1662 Book of Common Prayer offers this expanded answer, here in modern language:*

My duty toward my neighbor is to love them as myself, and to do to all people as I would have them do to me: 

- to love, honor, and care for my father and mother; 
- to honor and obey those in legitimate authority; 
- to submit myself to my teachers, spiritual leaders, and mentors; 
- to treat all people with respect; 
- to hurt no one by word or deed; 
- to be true and just in all my dealings; to bear no malice or hatred in my heart; 
- to keep my hands from stealing, and my tongue from evil-speaking, lying, and slander; 
- to keep my body in self-control, sobriety, and purity; 
- not to covet or desire what belongs to others; 
- but to learn and work honestly to earn my own living, and to do my duty in whatever situation of life God calls me to.
{{< /callout >}}

### What is the purpose of the Ten Commandments?

The Ten Commandments were given to define our relationship with God and our neighbors.

### Since we do not fully obey them, are they useful at all?

Since we do not fully obey them, we see more clearly our sin and our need for redemption.

{{< callout "note" >}}
*The 1662 Book of Common Prayer adds this instruction:*

Know this: that you are not able to do these things by yourself, nor to walk in the commandments of God and serve him, without his special grace; which you must learn at all times to call for by diligent prayer.
{{< /callout >}}

## Sin and Redemption

### What is sin?

Sin is the seeking of our own will instead of the will of God, thus distorting our relationship with God, with other people, and with all creation.

### How does sin have power over us?

Sin has power over us because we lose our liberty when our relationship with God is distorted.

### What is redemption?

Redemption is the act of God which sets us free from the power of evil, sin, and death.

### How did God prepare us for redemption?

God sent the prophets to call us back to himself, to show us our need for redemption, and to announce the coming of the Messiah.

### What is meant by the Messiah?

The Messiah is one sent by God to free us from the power of sin, so that with the help of God we may live in harmony with God, within ourselves, with our neighbors, and with all creation.

### What is the nature of God revealed in Jesus?

God is love.

### What do we mean when we say that Jesus was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and became incarnate from the Virgin Mary?

We mean that by God's own act, his divine Son received our human nature from the Virgin Mary, his mother.

### Why did he take our human nature?

The divine Son became human, so that in him human beings might be adopted as children of God, and be made heirs of God's kingdom.

### What is the great importance of Jesus' suffering and death?

By his obedience, even to suffering and death, Jesus made the offering which we could not make; in him we are freed from the power of sin and reconciled to God.

### What is the significance of Jesus' resurrection?

By his resurrection, Jesus overcame death and opened for us the way of eternal life.

### What do we mean when we say that he descended to the dead?

We mean that he went to the departed and offered them also the benefits of redemption.

### What do we mean when we say that he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father?

We mean that Jesus took our human nature into heaven where he now reigns with the Father and intercedes for us.

### How can we share in his victory over sin, suffering, and death?

We share in his victory when we are baptized into the New Covenant and become living members of Christ.

The New Commandment is that we love one another as Christ loved us.

### Where may we find what Christians believe about Christ?

What Christians believe about Christ is found in the Scriptures and summed up in the creeds.

The creeds are statements of our basic beliefs about God.

### How many creeds does this Church use in its worship?

This Church uses two creeds: The Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.

### What is the Apostles' Creed?

The Apostles' Creed is the ancient creed of Baptism; it is used in the Church's daily worship to recall our Baptismal Covenant.

{{< callout "note" >}}
*The 1662 Book of Common Prayer includes the text of the Apostles' Creed at this point:*

> I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth;
> 
> and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried. He descended to the dead. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From there he shall come to judge the living and the dead.
> 
> I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

*The 1662 Book of Common Prayer then asks:*

### What do you chiefly learn from the articles of your belief?

- First, I learn to believe in God the Father, who has made me and all the world.

- Third, in God the Holy Spirit, who sanctifies me and all God's people.

*The 1662 Book of Common Prayer then asks:*

### What do you ask of God in this prayer?

I ask my Lord God, our heavenly Father, who is the giver of all goodness, to send his grace to me and to all people, that we may worship him, serve him, and obey him as we ought. I pray that God will send us all things needful both for our souls and bodies, that he will be merciful to us and forgive us our sins, that he will save and defend us in all dangers of body and spirit, and that he will keep us from all sin and wickedness, from our spiritual enemy, and from everlasting death. This I trust he will do out of his mercy and goodness, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore I say, Amen: So be it.

The principal kinds of prayer are

- adoration,

- and petition.

### What is adoration?

Adoration is the lifting up of the heart and mind to God, asking nothing but to enjoy God's presence.

### For what do we offer thanksgiving?

Thanksgiving is offered to God for all the blessings of this life, for our redemption, and for whatever draws us closer to God.

In penitence, we confess our sins and make restitution where possible, with the intention to amend our lives.

The sacraments are outward and visible signs of inward and spiritual grace, given by Christ as sure and certain means by which we receive that grace.

{{< callout "note" >}}
*The 1662 Book of Common Prayer phrases this similarly:*

A sacrament is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given to us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means by which we receive that grace, and a pledge to assure us of it.

Infants are baptized so that they can share citizenship in the Covenant, membership in Christ, and redemption by God.

{{< callout "note" >}}

Promises are made for them by their parents and sponsors, who guarantee that the infants will be brought up within the Church, to know Christ and be able to follow him.

## Other Sacramental Rites

### What other sacramental rites evolved in the Church under the guidance of the Holy Spirit?

Other sacramental rites which evolved in the Church include confirmation, ordination, holy matrimony, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction.

### How do they differ from the two sacraments of the Gospel?

Although they are means of grace, they are not necessary for all persons in the same way that Baptism and the Eucharist are.

### What is Confirmation?

Confirmation is the rite in which we express a mature commitment to Christ, and receive strength from the Holy Spirit through prayer and the laying on of hands by a bishop.

### What is required of those to be confirmed?

It is required of those to be confirmed that they have been baptized, are sufficiently instructed in the Christian Faith, are penitent for their sins, and are ready to affirm their confession of Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.

### What is Ordination?

Ordination is the rite in which God gives authority and the grace of the Holy Spirit to those being made bishops, priests, and deacons, through prayer and the laying on of hands by bishops.

### What is Holy Matrimony?

Holy Matrimony is Christian marriage, in which two people enter into a life-long union, make their vows before God and the Church, and receive the grace and blessing of God to help them fulfill their vows.

### What is Reconciliation of a Penitent?

Reconciliation of a Penitent, or Penance, is the rite in which those who repent of their sins may confess them to God in the presence of a priest, and receive the assurance of pardon and the grace of absolution.

### What is Unction of the Sick?

Unction is the rite of anointing the sick with oil, or the laying on of hands, by which God's grace is given for the healing of spirit, mind, and body.

### Is God's activity limited to these rites?

God does not limit himself to these rites; they are patterns of countless ways by which God uses material things to reach out to us.

### How are the sacraments related to our Christian hope?

Sacraments sustain our present hope and anticipate its future fulfillment.

---

## The Christian Hope

### What is the Christian hope?

The Christian hope is to live with confidence in newness and fullness of life, and to await the coming of Christ in glory, and the completion of God's purpose for the world.

### What do we mean by the coming of Christ in glory?

By the coming of Christ in glory, we mean that Christ will come, not in weakness but in power, and will make all things new.

### What do we mean by heaven and hell?

By heaven, we mean eternal life in our enjoyment of God; by hell, we mean eternal death in our rejection of God.

### Why do we pray for the dead?

We pray for them, because we still hold them in our love, and because we trust that in God's presence those who have chosen to serve him will grow in his love, until they see him as he is.

### What do we mean by the last judgment?

We believe that Christ will come in glory and judge the living and the dead.

### What do we mean by the resurrection of the body?

We mean that God will raise us from death in the fullness of our being, that we may live with Christ in the communion of the saints.

### What is the communion of saints?

The communion of saints is the whole family of God, the living and the dead, those whom we love and those whom we hurt, bound together in Christ by sacrament, prayer, and praise.

### What do we mean by everlasting life?

By everlasting life, we mean a new existence, in which we are united with all the people of God, in the joy of fully knowing and loving God and each other.

### What, then, is our assurance as Christians?

Our assurance as Christians is that nothing, not even death, shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

*Amen.*

## A Note on Sources

This enhanced catechism draws from two primary sources:

**[The Book of Common Prayer (1979), Episcopal Church (USA)](https://www.bcponline.org/)** provides the main structure and most of the content. The 1979 revision represented a significant liturgical renewal, incorporating insights from the wider ecumenical movement and contemporary biblical scholarship while maintaining continuity with Anglican tradition.

**[The Book of Common Prayer (1662), Church of England](https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer)** provides supplementary material, particularly in the areas of baptismal identity, the full text of the Ten Commandments, expanded explanations of duties to God and neighbor, the text and explanation of the Lord's Prayer and Apostles' Creed, and additional detail on the sacraments. The 1662 BCP remains the authorized prayer book of the Church of England and has shaped Anglican worship worldwide for over three centuries.

Material from the 1662 BCP has been rendered in modern English while preserving its theological content. Certain elements reflecting the social assumptions of the seventeenth century (such as references to monarchical authority and rigid social hierarchy) have been adapted for contemporary use while maintaining the substance of the teaching.
