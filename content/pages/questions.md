## Questions I'm Asking

(These are in addition to [these "self-elicitation" questions, which are always worth asking yourself](/questions-worth-asking/)!)

- How do I fix a light switch that doesn't controll a ceiling light/fan like I want it to?
- How do I get rid of woodpeckers that keep pecking my house?
- What's the best "budget" bidet?
- What's the best "budget" smart TV?
- When should I replace my 2016 MacBook Pro, and what should I replace it with?
- What reference works should I expand my personal library with?
- Why does Toledo's NPR station play so much classical music? Is there a way to get more NPR programming on the station?

On a deeper level: 
- What was the point of 12 years of theological studies, getting ordained, etc., if I'm now working fulltime as a software engineer?
- What has happened to the church in the USA?
- What can be done at the grassroots level to counter fascism, Christian Nationalism, etc.?
