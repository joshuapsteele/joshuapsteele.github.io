## Questions I'm Asking

(These are in addition to [these "self-elicitation" questions, which are always worth asking yourself](/questions-worth-asking/)!)

- How do I fix a light switch that doesn't controll a ceiling light/fan like I want it to?
- How do I get rid of woodpeckers that keep pecking my house?
- What's the best "budget" bidet?
- What's the best "budget" smart TV?

On a deeper level: 
- What was the point of 12 years of theological studies, getting ordained, etc., if I'm now working fulltime as a software engineer?
- What has happened to the church in the USA?

## Questions I've Answered
