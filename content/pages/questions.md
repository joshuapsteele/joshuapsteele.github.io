## Questions I'm Asking

(These are in addition to [these "self-elicitation" questions, which are always worth asking yourself](/questions-worth-asking/)!)

- What are the most helpful resources (books, podcasts, shows, exercises, etc.) for teaching young children how to have good manners?
- What's the best, easiest workflow for sharing links online?
- What's a good "budget" version of a [Veto Pro Pac TP-LC tool bag](https://www.amazon.com/Veto-TP-LC-Compact-Zippered-Service/dp/B09TPZKBDP?crid=1GMT9CXVFGOKD&keywords=veto+pro+pac+tp-lc+toolbag&qid=1671342063&sprefix=veta+pro+pac+tp-lc+toolbag%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=joshuapsteele-20&linkId=91591755d9deffe180a33ac4195d2fac&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)?
- What are the most useful lengths and kinds of rope to have on hand?
- What are the most useful dimensions/kinds of lumber to have on hand?
- How do I get rid of woodpeckers that keep pecking my house?

On a deeper level: 
- What are the socioeconomic implications of following Jesus of Nazareth and his teachings?
- What was the point of 12 years of theological studies, getting ordained, etc., if I'm now working fulltime as a software engineer?
- What has happened to the church in the USA?
- What can be done at the grassroots level to counter fascism, Christian Nationalism, etc.?

## Questions I've Answered

- Are `/questions` pages like this a thing?
    - Yes! Thanks to [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/), `/questions` is now a [featured slash page type on slashpages.net](https://slashpages.net/#questions).
- [What's the best "budget" smart TV?](/best-budget-smart-tv/)
- How can I check my roof, attic, insulation, etc. for leaks, mold, etc.?
    - I purchased [this moisture meter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SZX8QXH?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=joshuapsteele-20&linkId=ed06380c82447c3233058a9ee9b89012&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and this [thermal camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWS4BVCX?&linkCode=ll1&tag=joshuapsteele-20&linkId=3b2824bcd71bcc987c21a9c7b85ea856&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) to help check for leaks around the house. Very helpful!
- How do I fix a light switch that doesn't controll a ceiling light/fan like I want it to?
    - Not really sure what's going on with the light switches in our upstairs bedrooms, but they don't seem to be meaningfully connected to the ceiling fans in the rooms, which is a bummer. I don't feel like fishing new wiring right now, so they're staying as-is (for now).
- When should I replace my 2016 MacBook Pro, and what should I replace it with?
    - I'm leaning toward installing Linux on my old MacBook Pro, but I haven't pulled the trigger yet.
- Why does Toledo's NPR station play so much classical music? Is there a way to get more NPR programming on the station?
    - Apparently this is due to preference and funding. I've started listening to Michigan Public Radio (91.7 FM) more often, because they have more NPR programming and less classical music.
- What reference works should I expand my personal library with?
    - After hunting Facebook Marketplace for awhile, I was able to snag a 1990 Encyclopaedia Britannica set for $50.
    - Got a full Britannica Great Books of the Western World set for $250.
    - I've also been collecting practical reference books on tools, home repair, homesteading, prepping, gardening, etc. You know, just in case society collapses and I no longer have access to Google and YouTube!
- What's the best "budget" bidet?
    - If/when my wife ever lets us get a bidet (she's worried about our toddler getting into things and causing a huge mess), I'll probably just go with [Wirecutter's Budget Pick](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bidet-toilet-seat-washlet/).
