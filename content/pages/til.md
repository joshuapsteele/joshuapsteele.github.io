This `/til` page is just one of [my many "slash pages."](/slashes)
{{< /callout >}}

This page contains brief notes about things I've learned, discovered, or found interesting. They're smaller than full blog posts but worth sharing.

- Smoked paprika is vastly superior to regular paprika.
- Pan-fried ham. Try it.

*This page is inspired by the /til concept, a collection of concise write-ups on small things I've learned day to day.*
