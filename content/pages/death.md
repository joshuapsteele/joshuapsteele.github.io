Yes, yes, I know it's a bit morbid, but here are some instructions for family and friends in case of my death:

- If possible, I'd like to be buried, in a simple, inexpensive casket.
- If cost is an issue, go ahead and cremate me. Just don't keep my ashes someplace weird, though. Feel free to scatter them in a place that was meaningful to me, or to you.
- I want a simple Christian funeral and burial service, focused on the hope of the resurrection. Save the eulogies for the reception.
- I try to keep short accounts. If I have wronged you, please forgive me. If you have wronged me, I forgive you.
- Let my death be a reminder to make the most of the time you have left, by loving God and loving your neighbor.
