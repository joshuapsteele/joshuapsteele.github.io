# The Problem: Everyone Loves a Good Story, But Few People Live One

Absolutely everyone wants to live a meaningful life - to live a good story.

So why do so _few_ of us feel like our lives have purpose?! Instead of a meaningful narrative, life seems like a series of random (at best) or unfortunate (at worst) events.

Yet, we all have a sneaking suspicion that things ought to be different, that there ought to be a greater sense of purpose, direction, and significance out there - something that can shape our chaotic series of events into a meaningful and beautiful story.

What if I told you that things _could_ be different?

# The Solution: Living The Good Story

I don't think that we're doomed to the meaningless chaos and stress of our day-to-day lives.

No, instead, I believe that the answer to our "living a good story" problem is to learn how to live THE Good Story - the story of who God is and what God is up to in the world.

Do you realize what this means? **You don't have to give your own life meaning.** Instead, your life is already meaningful. The world around you, chaotic and stressful though it is, is already significant. All we need are eyes to see it.

We've lost our story, but we can find it again. We can learn it again. We can live it again.

# If this vision resonates with you, consider hiring me as your coach!

Here's what that process looks like.

## First, Schedule Your FREE Coaching Session

Using the form below, contact me to schedule a **FREE** 60-minute coaching session, to see if I'd be a good fit for you as a life coach.

After you contact me using the form above, I will email you back to schedule a time for our first 60-minute session.

## Second, Answer These 8 Questions

As a part of our email conversation, I will ask you to answer the following 8 questions before our first coaching conversation.

1. Give me as much detail as you can about what you consider to be your **life purpose**. What were you put on this earth to do?
1. How well do your **current roles** in life align with your purpose and strengths?
1. What are some **dreams** you'd like to pursue in the next five years?
1. **What is most important** to you in your life?
1. List your **top 5 strengths and your top 3 weaknesses**.
1. Fill in the blank: "The **problems or challenges** I most want to overcome right now are: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
1. Fill in the blank: "The **tangible outcome** I want from being coached is: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
1. Fill in the blank: "What I most desire from my coach is: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

## Third, Enjoy Your First Free Coaching Conversation

In this first FREE 60-minute session, we'll discuss:
\- Your story
\- Why you're interested in pursuing coaching
\- What change(s) you'd like to make in your life
\- What obstacles are getting in the way of those changes
\- What you're looking for in a coach
\- What to expect from me as your coach

## Finally, Decide Whether or Not You Want Me to Coach You

At the end of our free 60-minute conversation, I'll ask you **if you're ready and willing to start a paid coaching relationship**.

### Here's what a paid coaching relationship costs:

- **$60.00** for an _Ã  la carte_ 60-minute coaching conversation
- **$300.00** for six (6) 60-minute coaching conversations, once every two (2) weeks, over the course of three (3) months

_IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are unsatisfied with the paid coaching you receive, I will either give you your money back or work with you to provide the value you're looking for._

### In our FIRST paid coaching session, we will focus on:

- Zeroing-in on a **SMART** (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-specific) **goal** that you are highly motivated to achieve
- Developing concrete **action steps** for you to take before our next conversation

### After that, here's what a TYPICAL coaching session looks like:

- At the scheduled time, you call me
- We talk about the most significant, pressing, or interesting thing going on in your life that week
- You give me a progress report on the action steps you committed to
- We discuss any action steps that require follow-up steps
- We return to your overarching goal(s) in order to develop further action steps, moving from what you _could_ do, to what you _would_ do, to what you _will_ do!
- We review the action steps you're committing to
- Finally, after the phone call, you'll send me an email containing (1) your new action steps, written out in your own words and (2) suggested times for our next coaching conversation
