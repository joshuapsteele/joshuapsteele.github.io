You can add the following caveats to everything I write online.

- **If it doesn't directly apply to you, feel free to move along**  
  I'm usually writing for a broad audience and just trying to get people thinking. If I'm interested in starting a debate or argument with a specific individual, I will say so directly.
- **If you think reality is more complicated than what I wrote, you're right**  
  All communication is an oversimplification of reality. The shorter my post, the more I've purposefully left out.
- **I will (almost) never get into extended arguments online**  
  If you still think you really need to say something, write your own post, write me an [email](/contact/), send me a letter, etc. (Just don't call me, I'm a Millennial!)

Finally, I'm just as susceptible to [cognitive biases](https://yourbias.is/) and [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) as anyone else. Nevertheless, I'd like to do my best to stick to [the following Rules of Civil Conversation](https://therulesofcivilconversation.org/). And I ask that you consider doing the same.

I resolve to:

1. Try and reach a shared understanding rather than ‘win the argument’.
2. Clarify with others to make sure I genuinely understand their perspective.
3. Endeavor to avoid committing [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) in support of my claims.
4. Attempt to account for my own [biases](https://yourbias.is/) and try to be intellectually humble.
5. Try to be reasonable, rational, and create coherent arguments.
6. Refrain from personal attacks, sarcasm, and mean-spiritedness.
7. Use the ‘[Principle of Charity](https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-the-principle-of-charity/)’ to see the merits of others’ points of view in the best light.
8. Remain genuinely receptive to changing my mind if presented with compelling arguments or evidence
