Please keep these points in mind when reading what I write.

- **Provoking Thought, Not Debate**  
  My intent is (almost always) to provoke thought, not start a debate or argument.

- **"I'm not Y!"**  
  You're probably right! If my words don’t apply to you, please feel free to ignore them and move along.

- **"Not all X! You left out Z!"**  
  I recognize that reality is complex and nuanced. Communication is always an oversimplification of reality. I try to value brevity, so I often keep things punchy and to the point when sharing online.

- **Avoiding Back-and-Forth Arguments**  
  I (almost) never engage in extended arguments on social media. If you really want to respond, please consider emailing me (contact details at [joshuapsteele.com/contact](/contact/)), writing your own post, or texting me. (But don’t call—I’m a Millennial.)
