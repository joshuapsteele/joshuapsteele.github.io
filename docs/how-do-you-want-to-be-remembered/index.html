<h3 id="what-if-however-we-could-use-death-to-our-own-advantage">What if, however, we could use death to our own advantage?</h3>
<p>I’m convinced this is the truth behind Ecclesiastes 7:2 –</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="text Eccl-7-2" id="en-NIV-17432">It is better to go to a house of mourning</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">than to go to a house of feasting,</span></span><br>
<span class="text Eccl-7-2">for death is the destiny of everyone;</span><br>
<span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks"> </span><span class="text Eccl-7-2">the living should take this to heart.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, obviously, simply taking death to heart isn’t enough to defeat our most ancient enemy. For that, we need (and have been given) a <em><strong>resurrection</strong></em>.</p>
<p>But, have you taken your own death to heart? I believe there’s something to be gained by considering how you’d like to be remembered by others after you die.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-want-to-be-remembered">How do you want to be remembered:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="by-god">by God?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-spouse">by your spouse?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-children">by your children?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-parents">by your parents?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-family-and-friends">by your family and friends?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="by-your-colleagues">by your colleagues?</h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, I’d like to be remembered:</p>
<ul>
<li>…as God’s faithful servant.</li>
<li>…as my wife’s best friend.</li>
<li>…as my children’s most important teacher.</li>
<li>…as my parents’ legacy.</li>
<li>…as my family and friends’ loyal brother.</li>
<li>…as my colleagues inspiring teammate.</li>
</ul>
<p>…which sounds great, right? But here’s the rub:</p>
<h2 id="what-span-styletext-decoration-underlinechangesspan-do-you-and-i-need-to-make-in-our-lives-to-start-making-those-hypothetical-memories-more-realistic-each-day">What <span style="text-decoration: underline;">changes</span> do you and I need to make in our lives, to start making those hypothetical memories more realistic each day?</h2>
<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on this in the comments below, as I consider how taking death to heart should impact one’s entire life.</p>
