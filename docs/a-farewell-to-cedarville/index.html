“A Farewell to Cedarville” – Joshua Steele
As what was once a vision for the future has become an agenda for returning to the past, the list of people who no longer fit the Cedarville mold is growing. I contacted former vice president of Student Life, Dr. Carl Ruby; former professor Dr. Michael Pahl; current professors Dr. TC Ham, Dr. Shawn Graves, and Dr. David Mills; and former trustees Dr. William Rudd and Rev. Chris Williamson to see where things stand as this academic year comes to a close.">

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>“A Farewell to Cedarville” – Joshua Steele</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>As what was once a vision for the future has become an agenda for returning to the past, the list of people who no longer fit the Cedarville mold is growing.</strong> I contacted former vice president of Student Life, Dr. <a href="http://www.carlruby.com/">Carl Ruby</a>; former professor Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelpahl/">Michael Pahl</a>; current professors Dr. TC Ham, Dr. Shawn Graves, and Dr. David Mills; and former trustees Dr. William Rudd and Rev. Chris Williamson to see where things stand as this academic year comes to a close.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Ruby does not know what the long term future holds, he is pouring himself into immigration reform. When asked about his plans, he replied: “I’m motivated by an experience that I had on the Civil Rights bus tour in Birmingham, Alabama. As I read King’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail, I determined that I didn’t want to be on the wrong side of history, or more important, on the wrong side of the gospel on these kinds of issues. I leave Cedarville with lots of good memories and a clear conscience. I hope I invested my time and energy in the things that mattered most … loving God and loving people.”</p>
<p>And speaking of immigrants, Dr. Pahl moved his family nearly 2,000 miles as the crow flies from Alberta, Canada to Cedarville, Ohio in 2011. However, after just two semesters, the “promising scholar” and “dedicated teacher” was fired for his inability <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/documents-2/the-dismissal-of-dr-pahl/">“to concur fully with each and every position of Cedarville University’s doctrinal statement.”</a> The Pahls have spent the year trying to move on – looking for work, and working on renovations to sell the old parsonage which they bought less than three months before receiving notice of Dr. Pahl’s “review.”</p>
<p>It would be one thing if the Pahls were victims of a broken immigration system. It seems, however, that they are victims of a broken institution which claims the name of Christ.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Ruby and Dr. Pahl had little say regarding their terminations, others are voluntarily choosing to disassociate from the University.</p>
<p>Prompted by the changing Cedarville climate, Dr. Ham will be making the move to Canton, OH this summer to teach at <a href="http://www.malone.edu/">Malone University</a>. “I should note that I am not being forced to resign. I am leaving voluntarily,” Dr. Ham clarified. “However, I would not have been seeking other ministry opportunities had the past two years been different. For me, it was the events surrounding the termination of my good friend Michael Pahl that prompted me to look elsewhere. Other recent events—mostly known to the student body, but some unknown to them—have served to solidify my decision. While I am very excited about my future ministry, it is with profound sadness that I leave the wonderful men and women I’ve known as colleagues here.”</p>
<p>After the elimination of the philosophy major, Dr. Graves was offered a terminal contract. However, he has instead accepted a tenure track position at the <a href="http://www.findlay.edu/Pages/default.aspx">University of Findlay</a>, where he will begin teaching this fall. His wife, <a href="http://marlenagraves.com/">Marlena Graves</a>, will conclude her role as the Resident Director of Murphy Hall at the end of this semester.</p>
<p>Dr. Mills, if he is at Cedarville next year, will have to carry the course load for the remaining philosophy minor in Dr. Graves’ absence. Dr. Mills declined the option to drastically expand the Honors Program during the 2013-14 school year before handing it over to an unknown successor, and was therefore removed from his involvement in the program, effective at the end of this semester.</p>
<p>The voluntary disassociations are not limited to faculty and staff, but also include trustees. Recent changes in the Board have included the resignations of <a href="http://calvarymuskegon.com/#/about-calvary/our-ministry-team">Dr. Rudd</a> and <a href="http://www.strongtowerbiblechurch.com/#/our-team">Rev. Williamson</a>, two proponents of the same concerns held by student advocates such as myself.</p>
<p>Dr. Rudd, who served as a Cedarville trustee for over 20 years, including multiple terms as Board Chairman, had the following to say regarding his resignation:</p>
<p>“I’m very thankful for CU and the privilege of being very closely associated with it for so many years. I have many dear friends there who are amazing servants of God. It saddens me deeply that I could no longer support actions and direction of the current leadership and that I was no longer able to exert influence for what I believe to be truthfulness, integrity, and Biblical consistency. God has graciously blessed Cedarville and there are many, many wonderful people still associated with it. I pray that the leadership will be restored to Biblical integrity.”</p>
<p>In Rev. Williamson’s words: “The board of trustees repeatedly mishandled God’s servants while virtually ignoring the cries of students and alumni alike. Any hint of due process was abandoned, and the ability to have respectful dialogues on key issues was non-existent. I resigned because I could no longer be associated with a group that was constantly untruthful and unjust.”</p>
<p><strong>And so the Cedarville diaspora grows</strong>. If this university is going to inspire true greatness, it should avoid driving away godly individuals like Ruby, Pahl, Ham, Graves, Mills, Williamson, and Rudd in the future.</p>
<p>Some may accuse me of biting the hand that feeds. But it is not the same hand.</p>
<p>I have been fed by Carl Ruby’s Cedarville, not the new Cedarville of twenty years ago. As the University hearkens back to the glory days before creeping “liberalism” reached the bubble’s border, the leadership has responded to repeated requests for clarity and honesty with poignant silences and disappointing distortions of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>God is not surprised. I wonder if he is angered, though, by having his knowledge and sovereignty used to justify injustice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cedarville, fulfill your call and be true to our God – not by claiming institutional prerogatives to drive away our Christlike best – but by doing justice, promoting honesty, and walking humbly with Him whose name we claim.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Update</em>:</strong></span> <em>Dr. Carl B. Smith, Professor of Church History, has willfully decided to turn in an unsigned contract. Although he does not have further employment lined up at this time, he will not be returning to Cedarville for the 2013-14 academic year.</em></p>
