<h3 id="be-genuinely-interested-in-others">Be genuinely interested in others</h3>
<p>Showing sincere interest in people makes them feel valued and appreciated. Ask questions, listen actively, and show empathy to create meaningful connections.</p>
<h3 id="smile-and-be-friendly">Smile and be friendly</h3>
<p>A warm smile and friendly demeanor create a positive atmosphere and make it easier for people to open up and trust you. Your body language and tone of voice matter just as much as your words.</p>
<h3 id="remember-and-use-peoples-names">Remember and use people’s names</h3>
<p>Using someone’s name in conversation shows that you respect and value them. It also helps to build rapport and strengthen relationships.</p>
