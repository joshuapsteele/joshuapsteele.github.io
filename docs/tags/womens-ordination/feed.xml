      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is not unanimous agreement about women’s ordination in the worldwide Anglican Communion. Godly and thoughtful Christians hold opposing convictions about Holy Orders and who is called to ordained ministry. You often see the results of this debate at the Provincial level—a national expression of the Church may or may not ordain women, in accordance with their conviction. But for the Anglican Church in North America this disagreement is internal to the Province, varying from diocese to diocese and bishop to bishop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost every vocational deacon I know, when asked why he or she has not become a priest, will respond, “I have never felt called to the priesthood.” Some will add emphatically, “not for a minute!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not one of those deacons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t share this story often, rarely in its fullness, and never in public non-anonymous writing. Be gentle with my soul, O Church. The words which follow are all too raw.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: The piece below represents the opinion of the author. Anglican Compass does not take a site-wide position for or against women’s ordination. We do, however, require both clarity and charity. We ask that your responses to it do so as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past several months, readers of Anglican Compass have engaged with many opinions on &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicancompass.com/tag/womens-ordination/&#34;&gt;the topic of women’s ordination&lt;/a&gt;. One wonders, given the state of dual integrities within the ACNA and the ever-churning blog debates between our public intellectuals, what is the point of another take on this issue?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: Thank you to the Rev. Dr. Emily McGowin for writing this rejoinder to &lt;a href=&#34;http://theopolisinstitute.com/sacramental-representation-and-the-created-order/&#34;&gt;Fr. Blake Johnson’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicancompass.com/the-problem-with-making-a-patristic-argument-for-the-ordination-of-women-a-response-to-emily-mcgowin/&#34;&gt;Fr. Lee Nelson’s&lt;/a&gt; responses to &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicancompass.com/if-women-can-be-saved-then-women-can-be-priests/&#34;&gt;her original blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the&lt;/em&gt; in persona Christi &lt;em&gt;argument against women’s ordination. While we invite this conversation (about McGowin’s original blog post) to continue in our comments section and elsewhere—and we plan to publish more about women’s ordination in the future—we will not be adding surrejoinder blog posts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-connection-between-christology-and-soteriology&#34;&gt;The connection between christology and soteriology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cornerstone of orthodox Christian theology is summed up in the phrase “what is not assumed is not healed”. The phrase is echoed by many early church fathers, but it is credited to St. Gregory of Nazianzus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, are coming to Anglicanism from a different tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, then one thing you should know is that Anglican debates about women’s ordination can often be quite different from debates about the same topic in other church contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is due to Anglicans having different views on, among other things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sacraments, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ordination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in my broadly evangelical/non-denominational/Baptist upbringing, debates about women in ministry centered on whether or not women were allowed to preach and teach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
