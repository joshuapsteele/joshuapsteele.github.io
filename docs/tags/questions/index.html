      <p>Say what you will about Tim Ferriss, I’ve always really enjoyed the <a href="https://tim.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/17-Questions-That-Changed-My-Life.pdf">questions that he asks himself</a> and <a href="https://tim.blog/2017/10/03/tribe-of-mentors/">others</a>.</p>
<p>I also really enjoy LEARNING as much as I can from other people. And so, with that in mind, I’d like to “open source” my search for mentors and <strong>invite you, dear reader, to answer at least one of the questions below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please comment your answers below</strong> this post (that way others can benefit from your knowledge as well!). Or, if you’d like, send them to me via email (<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/contact/">use my contact form here</a>). Then, go ask these questions to others! Cheers!</p>

        8 Questions to Ask While Reading Theology
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>While reading Beth Felker Jones’ <a href="https://amzn.to/2vLkeEo"><em>Practicing Christian Doctrine: An Introduction to Thinking and Living Theologically</em></a>, I came across the following list of extremely helpful questions to ask while reading theology (on page 29).</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What are the key Christian teachings being articulated? What is the author’s driving concern or main theme?</li>
<li>What counts for the author as authoritative (Scripture, tradition, reason, experience…)? Is the author’s theological method implicit or explicit?</li>
<li>How does the author deal with the witness of Scripture?<br>
a. Implicitly? Explicitly?<br>
b. Does the witness of the Old Testament matter? The New?<br>
c. What biblical themes are privileged?<br>
d. What interpretive principles are at work?</li>
<li>How do these claims relate to other doctrines?</li>
<li>How does context (including gender, race, class, culture, and time) shape the theological voice? Is the theologian conscious of this? How does your context shape your evaluation of the piece?</li>
<li>Practice reading charitably. What is the best possible interpretation of how the piece reflects an attempt to be faithful to Jesus Christ?</li>
<li>How do these theological claims relate to the life of faith? Doe you bring other questions from your experience?</li>
<li>If this theological proposal were taken seriously, how would it shape Christian practice? Would it affect our participation in spiritual disciplines? Our understanding of faithful living? Our practice of evangelism? Our life as the church?</li>
</ol>

<p>Right? Even with helpful books out there like <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2DQ55nt">How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth</a></em> (that’s an affiliate link, by the way, meaning that I get a small commission at no cost to you if you end up buying the book), there are still so many potential questions to ask of any biblical text when we study it.</p>
<p>How are we supposed to keep questions of authorship, genre, meaning, application, etc. etc. straight when we study the Bible?</p>
