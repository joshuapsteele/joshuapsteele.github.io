      <description>(To listen to the audio of this sermon as it was preached on June 6, 2020, click here.)
Christians believe that there is one God in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
Or, as my daughter Eva put it recently after seeing a picture in her book, “Father, Son, and Bird.” We’re working on that…

      <description>I’d like to pray this week’s collect again:
Merciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.
Introduction It’s been a particularly difficult week here at Church of the Savior.</description>
