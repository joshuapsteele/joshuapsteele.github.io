      <description>Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I’ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.
Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and trapped often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.
I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!</description>
