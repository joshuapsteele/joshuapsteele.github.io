      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in recent weeks, I’ve decided to try out a combination of counseling and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’ve still been able to get out of bed in the morning. And I wasn’t having any serious thoughts about hurting myself. But still, I was feeling hopeless and &lt;em&gt;trapped&lt;/em&gt; often enough that I decided it was time to seek out help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know, I know. That’s pretty personal for a blog post for the whole internet to read!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
