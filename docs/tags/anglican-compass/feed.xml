      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is not unanimous agreement about women’s ordination in the worldwide Anglican Communion. Godly and thoughtful Christians hold opposing convictions about Holy Orders and who is called to ordained ministry. You often see the results of this debate at the Provincial level—a national expression of the Church may or may not ordain women, in accordance with their conviction. But for the Anglican Church in North America this disagreement is internal to the Province, varying from diocese to diocese and bishop to bishop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost every vocational deacon I know, when asked why he or she has not become a priest, will respond, “I have never felt called to the priesthood.” Some will add emphatically, “not for a minute!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not one of those deacons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t share this story often, rarely in its fullness, and never in public non-anonymous writing. Be gentle with my soul, O Church. The words which follow are all too raw.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m pondering the “don’t stir the pot” reaction that reliably happens every time we publish something on women’s ordination—most especially anything in &lt;em&gt;favor&lt;/em&gt; of women’s ordination—&lt;a href=&#34;https://anglicancompass.com/&#34;&gt;over at Anglican Compass&lt;/a&gt;, where I’m the Managing Editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: This post is not a subtweet of anyone in particular. It’s just me thinking out loud about a phenomenon that keeps occurring.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Almost every time we post something about women’s ordination, a controversial issue has been whether or not doing so needlessly “stirs the pot,” as in “causes trouble, unrest, dissent.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One wonders, given the state of dual integrities within the ACNA and the ever-churning blog debates between our public intellectuals, what is the point of another take on this issue?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of this morning, it looks like everything for &lt;a href=&#34;https://anglicancompass.com/&#34;&gt;Anglican Compass&lt;/a&gt; has been successfully moved over from our HostGator shared hosting to Bluehost VPS hosting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that this new arrangement works well for us! Although, to be honest, it’s still an open question in my mind whether or not managed WordPress hosting with WPEngine would be a better fit. I just can’t quite tell whether or not it would be worth the extra cost, given our current traffic and budget.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe you, like me, are coming to Anglicanism from a different tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, then one thing you should know is that Anglican debates about women’s ordination can often be quite different from debates about the same topic in other church contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is due to Anglicans having different views on, among other things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the sacraments, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ordination.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, in my broadly evangelical/non-denominational/Baptist upbringing, debates about women in ministry centered on whether or not women were allowed to preach and teach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If that’s the case, then one thing you should know is that Anglican debates about women’s ordination can often be quite different from debates about the same topic in other church contexts.
This is due to Anglicans having different views on, among other things:
ecclesiology (the doctrine of the church), the sacraments, and ordination. For example, in my broadly evangelical/non-denominational/Baptist upbringing, debates about women in ministry centered on whether or not women were allowed to preach and teach.</description>
