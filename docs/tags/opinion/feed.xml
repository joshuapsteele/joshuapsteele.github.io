      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures—unless it’s done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient—is pretentious. It’s showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that I’m not making a claim about the *people* who use crosses in their signatures, their inner thoughts, or their intentions. For all I know, every single clergyperson out there says a prayer of blessing for their recipients every single time they use the sign of the cross in a signature. I’m also not writing this about any person in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
