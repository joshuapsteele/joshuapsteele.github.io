<p>This course is an introduction to the methods of systematic theology and the major topics within biblical revelation. Special attention is given to the rationale for these Christian doctrines, their systematic interconnections as well as their development within the history of Christian thought, and their contemporary challenges. This class is your opportunity to reinforce why you believe what you believe and to examine how it impacts your life.</p>
<ul>
<li>~15-20 students, graduate, non-theology majors; assuming that this is the first and last systematic theology course you’ll take (but not the last time you’ll do theology, hopefully!).</li>
<li>Meets twice a week (T/R) for 110 minutes (80 mins of content, 20 minutes of breaks, 10 minutes of intro and conclusion). We’ll be modeling each class session after the “Pomodoro Technique,” in which you do focused work for 20 mins and then reward yourself with a short break. Here’s the rough outline:
<ul>
<li>5 min: opening prayer, introduction</li>
<li>20 min content</li>
<li>5 min break</li>
<li>20 min content</li>
<li>10 min break</li>
<li>20 min content</li>
<li>5 min break</li>
<li>20 min content</li>
<li>5 min: conclusion, final questions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h1>

<h1 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="participation-amp-assigned-reading--20">Participation &amp; Assigned Reading – 20%</h2>
<p>Participation will be based on class discussions, which will require students to come to class prepared by having read thoughtfully the assigned readings.</p>
<p>Students will be expected to read all of the required texts in their entirety as indicated on the course schedule. This reading needs to be complete <strong>prior to</strong> the designated class session and students will be graded based on their ability to participate actively in the discussions relative to those readings.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that additional articles may be assigned during the course.</p>
<h2 id="reading-quizzes--20">Reading Quizzes – 20%</h2>
<p>Once a week (the first class session of the week), students will take a brief reading quiz on the main points of the assigned reading (usually from McGrath’s <em>Theology: The Basics</em>) for that day.</p>
<h2 id="reading-presentations--20">Reading Presentations – 20%</h2>
<p>Once a week (the second class session of the week), students will give brief presentations on the assigned primary source readings from McGrath’s <em>Theology: The Basic Readings.</em></p>
<p>In each presentation, the student will have 2 minutes to:<br>
– read a <strong>one-sentence summary</strong> of the passage that they’ve written<br>
– <strong>praise</strong> one aspect/point of the reading<br>
– <strong>critique</strong> one aspect/point of the reading.</p>
<p>The rest of the class will then spend ˜5 minutes responding to each presentation, before moving on to the next presentation.</p>
<p>Each student will give 3-4 presentations over the course of the semester. The schedule for reading presentations will be assigned by the professor at the beginning of the course.</p>
<p><em>Don’t like public speaking?</em> That’s OK. I encourage you to manuscript your presentation and read it.</p>
<h2 id="one-minute-papers--10">One-Minute Papers – 10%</h2>
<p>Over the course of the semester (5 times), students will be given a few minutes in class to write out their answer to a reflection question, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the muddies/least clear idea you encountered in class this week?</li>
<li>What was the most important idea you encountered in class this week?</li>
<li>What important questions remain unanswered for you?</li>
</ul>
<p>These brief papers will be left with or emailed to the professor, and will be graded on a pass/fail basis for each paper (i.e., if you do all 5, you’ll get full credit, if you do 4/5, you’ll get 80% credit).</p>
<h2 id="final-paper--30">Final Paper – 30%</h2>
<p>Over the course of the semester, students will work on a 3,000 word essay on a theological topic of their choice (within the broad range of theological topics covered in Jenson and McGrath).</p>
<p>I expect you to incorporate at least two sources in addition to the assigned readings in this class.</p>
<p>Overall, this project will be worth 30% of the final grade. However, it will be completed in stages. Students will:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pick a topic</strong> and let the professor know by the fourth class session (end of week 2).</li>
<li><strong>Submit a 1-2 page outline, abstract, and bibliography (5% of final grade)</strong> by the tenth class session (end of week 5). Let me know what additional sources you’re thinking about using.</li>
<li>Receive a graded outline/abstract with feedback by the twelfth class session (end of week 6).</li>
<li><strong>Submit a 3,000 word final paper (15% of final grade)</strong> by the twentieth class session (end of week 10).</li>
<li>Receive a graded final paper with feedback by the twenty-fourth class session (end of week 12).</li>
<li><strong>Submit a 3,000 word revised final paper (10% of final grade)</strong> by the thirtieth class session (end of week 15, end of term). You’ll be expected to give me a <strong>one paragraph summary of how you’ve improved the paper</strong>.</li>

<h1 id="rationale-for-textbooks">Rationale for Textbooks</h1>
<p>These days, we’re spoiled for choice when it comes to theology textbooks. I don’t claim to have chosen the very best textbooks, but here are some of my reasons for choosing the texts I did, as well as my reasons for <em>not</em> choosing 5 books that almost made the cut.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-chose-our-texts">Why I Chose Our Texts</h2>
<h3 id="jenson-a-theology-in-outline">Jenson, <em>A Theology in Outline</em></h3>
<p>I wanted us to read a brief book that (1) showcased a theologian <em>doing</em> theology, and not merely surveying theology and (2) gave a taste for how the various aspects of Christian doctrine hang together. Jenson’s book, comprised of lectures he gave to undergraduate students at Princeton at the end of his career, fit the bill nicely. It will give us a taste of what Christian theology can look like as a whole before we dive into its parts. I also hope that it provides enough grist for the mill early in the semester so that you can choose topics that you’re interested in for your papers.</p>
<h3 id="kibbe-from-topic-to-thesis">Kibbe, <em>From Topic to Thesis</em></h3>
<p>Speaking of papers, Kibbe’s book is an excellent primer for theological research and writing. Because people come into this course from different academic backgrounds, some kind of introduction to what research and writing should look like in theology is necessary. I know of no better bang for the buck (and for the page) than this recent book from Kibbe.</p>
<h3 id="mcgrath-theology-the-basics-amp-theology-the-basic-readings">McGrath, <em>Theology: The Basics</em> &amp; <em>Theology: The Basic Readings</em></h3>
<p>I’ll admit that it was difficult to choose between these two shorter books and McGrath’s longer offerings, <em>Christian Theology: An Introduction</em> and <em>The Christian Theology Reader.</em></p>
<p>All of McGrath’s textbooks are excellent in that they expose the reader to the main contours of Christian theology and how those contours have developed over the history of the Church. Furthermore, McGrath teaches you how to engage with primary texts, and gives you guided practice in doing so. Finally, these textbooks have stood the test of time, going through multiple revisions that have incorporated classroom feedback from around the world.</p>
<p>In the end, I went with the shorter options because I’d like us to have time to engage with the works quite thoroughly, instead of feeling like we have to struggle to keep up with the longer books.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’ll be drawing from McGrath’s longer books frequently in my lectures, and I highly recommend them to you for after this course if this semester successfully whets your appetite for Christian theology!</p>
<h2 id="the-top-5-that-almost-made-the-cut">The “Top 5” that Almost Made the Cut</h2>
<p>(Note: these are in alphabetical order, not ranked.)</p>
<h3 id="erickson-christian-theology">Erickson, <em>Christian Theology</em></h3>
<p>Erickson’s work is a classic and would be well worth your time and money to purchase and use as a reference after this course. However, it’s almost 1200 pages long. While that allows him to address many topics that aren’t covered in McGrath’s shorter books, I felt it was too long of a text to require for this semester.</p>
<h3 id="grudem-systematic-theology">Grudem, <em>Systematic Theology</em></h3>
<p>Grudem’s is perhaps the best-known systematic theology in evangelical circles. It has many merits, especially the extent to which it integrates biblical material at every turn (the subtitle is, appropriately, “An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine”). However, it’s just over 1200 pages long—too long, in my opinion, for a one semester survey.</p>
<h3 id="felker-jones-practicing-christian-doctrine">Felker Jones, <em>Practicing Christian Doctrine</em></h3>
<p>This work isn’t a classic, yet! I do suspect, however, that it will gain in popularity because, coming in at under 250 pages, it’s a fantastic introduction to Christian doctrine and the importance of both “thinking and living theologically” (from the book’s subtitle). However, while the book has more of an emphasis on living theologically than McGrath does, it contains less guidance and practice of engaging with primary sources. No single book can do everything, of course, but the associated reader was a big reason why I chose McGrath over Felker Jones.</p>
<h3 id="oden-classic-christianity">Oden, <em>Classic Christianity</em></h3>
<p>This book is a wonderful resource for finding out what the consensus teaching of the Church, emphasis on the early Church, has been on the various main topics of Christian theology—“classic consensual ecumenical teaching,” as Oden puts it. It reads almost like a systematically-categorized catalogue of quotations from the early Church. I think it deserves a place on your bookshelf alongside another more “standard” systematic theology like Erickson or van der Kooi and van den Brink. However, at just over 900 pages, it’s too long to work well as a main text for this course.</p>
<h3 id="van-der-kooi-amp-van-den-brink-christian-dogmatics">Van der Kooi &amp; van den Brink, <em>Christian Dogmatics</em></h3>
<p>This is another resource that isn’t a classic yet, at least not in the USA, because it’s only been available in English translation since 2017. However, it’s already a classic work in Dutch since it came out in the Netherlands in 2012. Just like Erickson and Grudem above, this is a pedagogically useful and comprehensive systematic theology. However, just like Erickson and Grudem, at 800 pages, this book is also too long to serve as our main text.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Erickson and Grudem approach things from a particularly Baptist perspective, van der Kooi and van den Brink approach things from a particularly Dutch Reformed perspective. Nothing against these perspectives, of course, but (1) I don’t hold them and (2) I think McGrath (as well as Felker Jones, Oden, and others) does a better job of exposing us to as broad/mainstream an exposition of Christian theology as possible.</p>
