Sweater weather
Losing weight with some help from Zepbound
Football season (pulling for the Detroit Lions and the University of Michigan Wolverines)
Harbor Freight coming out with version 2.0 of its “meme tool” – now with sockets! Hopefully out before the end of the year
Reading The Widening of God’s Mercy: Sexuality Within the Biblical Story by Christopher and Richard Hays when it comes out next week
Learning auto repair by working on my dad’s 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 (next up: replacing the governor pressure solenoid and sensor in the transmission, which will hopefully help with the truck getting stuck in low gear!)

What are you excited about these days?">
