I’ve gained at least 50 pounds.
I had a fun part-time gig as a managing editor come to an end.
I’ve come to terms with some long-term depression and anxiety.
I had a job offer ripped out from under me.
I hit pause on and eventually dropped out of my Ph.D. program.
I’ve resigned from ordained ministry in the ACNA, my previous denomination.

Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.">

<p>Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.</p>
<p>But, overall, I definitely feel less focused and energized than I used to.</p>
<p>Do I have a sure solution or a grand commitment to make? No.</p>
<p>But I decided that I can at least start blogging about turning things around. I can write about my experiences as I try to get back into the personal development saddle.</p>
<p>As a first step, I need to get a better grip of everything I’ve got “in flight” at the moment. I’ve got far too many things bouncing around in my head, and I need to get them down on paper and/or a digital system to manage them.</p>
<p>So I’ve dusted-off my copy of <a href="https://amzn.to/3wJO5iZ"><em>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</em> by David Allen</a>. And I’ve started a “brain dump” in my main notebook (a Bullet Journal-like combination of journaling, to-dos, and notes).</p>
<p>Any other crestfallen personal development/productivity junkies out there? Let me know how it’s going!</p>
