      <title>StickKing to the Slow Carb Diet</title>

      <description>Last night, the scale read 192.4. I&amp;rsquo;d really like it to read 180 or less.
So, in lieu of how effective putting money on the line via StickK has been for my daily writing habit these past two weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to put money on the line as motivation to stick to the Slow Carb Diet for a month.
For my writing habit, I&amp;rsquo;ve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks.</description>

      <title>Eva Joy Steele: A Birth Story</title>

      <description>This is a self-indulgently long story. The gist of it is that my wife, Rachel, was unexpectedly induced due to gestational hypertension at 37 weeks, right before we were supposed to head to Pennsylvania for her sister&amp;rsquo;s wedding.
After a lengthy induction and labor, our beautiful daughter, Eva Joy Steele, was born at 5:46am on Friday, July 20, 2018.
If that&amp;rsquo;s all you&amp;rsquo;d like to know, great! If you&amp;rsquo;d like to know more about what went down, keep reading.</description>

      <title>This Song is a Beautiful Picture of the Theological Journey</title>

      <description>I was recently privileged to see one of my favorite bands, The Oh Hellos, in concert at the House of Blues in downtown Chicago.
I love all of The Oh Hellos&amp;rsquo; music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it. The song is called &amp;ldquo;The Truth is a Cave,&amp;rdquo; and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I&amp;rsquo;m calling &amp;ldquo;the theological journey&amp;rdquo; - the stages one goes through in one&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of God.</description>

      <description>Rachel and I just got back from our very first trip to the Southwest. The main reason for the trip was to visit some good friends of ours, the Smith family, in Phoenix, AZ. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of the group of us together after church at Living Faith Anglican Church in Tempe, AZ, where my friend Peter Smith is the rector.
The trip was a blast. It was great to catch up with the Smiths and to see their new home and church in Arizona.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re Expecting! In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard the news, my wife Rachel and I are expecting our firstborn child this August! Rachel is currently 16 weeks along, and we won&amp;rsquo;t find out the gender of the baby (whom I am affectionately calling &amp;ldquo;Lump&amp;rdquo;) for another month.
The last few months have been quite busy for us since we found out Rachel is pregnant. She works full-time as a Family Nurse Practitioner.</description>

      <description>The following is an attempt to tell my testimony, the story of my Christian faith, in approximately 500 words. It was challenging to do, but also a helpful exercise! I challenge you to write out your own story in approximately 500 words.
Testimony For as long as I can remember, I have known and followed Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. However, there has been a lingering problem in our relationship – on my end.</description>

      <description>As I prepare for my final semester at Beeson Divinity School, it strikes me just how well I was prepared for my seminary education by my undergraduate professors at Cedarville University.
All things considered, my time at CU exposed me to the riches of biblical and theological studies, and it left me hungry for more.
College gave me a love for Christ&amp;rsquo;s gospel and Christ&amp;rsquo;s Church - which has only increased since I arrived at Beeson.</description>

      <title>Theology in Outline: What Do I Believe?</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/theology-outline/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 11:45:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/theology-outline/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theology is confusing enough, much more so when you attempt to summarize it all in a single essay! Nevertheless, such was my assignment in seminary in 2015. Here are the results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“At the centre of Christian faith is the history of Christ.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;At the centre of the history of Christ is his passion and his death on the cross.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;~ Jürgen Moltmann&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;theology-in-outline-an-attempted-summary-of-the-christian-faith&#34;&gt;Theology in Outline: A[n Attempted] Summary of the Christian Faith&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that, during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, God died on a Roman cross. &lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; We also believe that, the third day thereafter, Jesus of Nazareth – the same person who had been crucified – rose again from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can these things be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can the immortal, transcendent, omnipotent One come to a weak, immanent end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a dead human leave his grave, living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we face a crucial choice between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the posited “God” of metaphysical theism and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the revealed God of the Christian faith. &lt;a href=&#34;#_ftn3&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we choose the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt;, our Christ, canon, and confession are irreducibly &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;docetic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – the true “God” is aloof, and merely play-acting, at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, should we choose the &lt;em&gt;latter&lt;/em&gt;, God is irreducibly, ineluctably Triune – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe, we &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; that the Triune God is who God has revealed Godself to be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>(This post is about my late uncle, Timothy Steele. It&amp;rsquo;s long, and I swear toward the end. Sorry.)
&amp;ldquo;It is better to go to a funeral than a feast. For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart. Sorrow is better than laughter, because sober reflection is good for the heart.&amp;rdquo; (Ecclesiastes 7:2-3)
Timothy Steele The juxtaposition is staggering. The funeral of the man I most associate with laughter and joy.</description>

      <title>Presenting on Karl Barth at 2015 Southeastern ETS</title>

      <description>I just received the news today that my student paper submission for the 2015 Southeast Regional Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society has been accepted!
My theme lately has been to write on Karl Barth and the unity of the Church. At last year&amp;rsquo;s Regional ETS (hosted by my seminary, Beeson Divinity School), I presented an edited version of my undergraduate thesis: Reconciliation and the Lack Thereof: Atonement, Ecclesiology, and the Unity of God.</description>

      <description>For my 20th Century History &amp;amp; Doctrine course at Beeson Divinity School, I&amp;rsquo;m re-reading through Karl Barth&amp;rsquo;s Evangelical Theology: An Introduction. If you&amp;rsquo;re involved in the life and ministry of the Church in any respect, I strongly recommend that you buy and read this book!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a particularly challenging portion from the chapter on &amp;ldquo;Wonder,&amp;rdquo; beginning on page 71. I wish the language were gender-inclusive, but Karl&amp;rsquo;s words still ring true:</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the previous post on Cedarville ends with a link to the Course Schedule:
&amp;ldquo;Class Limited to Women&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; I know, ludicrous. Especially considering Joy Fagan&amp;rsquo;s previous track record of making the first class, Scriptural Interpretation of Gender Issues (or SIGI), a truly excellent course by all accounts from former students, male and female.
Equally ludicrous? The textbook choices! Are you ready for what CU students will be reading to form an even-handed perspective of what the Bible has to say on gender?</description>

      <description>Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours &amp;ndash; as compared with the past few months &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d get many more views on this post if it concerned the chaos at Cedarville University!
However, my schedule and blood pressure won&amp;rsquo;t allow me to devote any more time to my shameful alma mater at the moment. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a presentation at the 2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS tomorrow (see my previous post, and come to my presentation at 5:00pm in room S009!</description>

Despite my Lenten Facebook fast, I was made aware of the following post by my friend Marlena Graves. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share it, just in case anyone is considering Cedarville as a choice for college. I&amp;rsquo;d still strongly recommend you attend another institution, where you can trust the administration. My previous thoughts on these matters still stand.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that Rachel and I will be completing my required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum for Beeson Divinity School along with our good friends Kyle, Rebekah, and baby Luke DeBoer in Lima, Peru this summer!

Seminario Teológico Bautista (Seminary) Luz del Camino Iglesia (Church) Vida Nueva Centro Prenatal (Pregnancy Center) The goal of Beeson&amp;rsquo;s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to &amp;quot; expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting.</description>

While we could both do with a little less humidity (!), we&amp;rsquo;re enjoying ourselves and our surroundings down here in Alabama.
What&amp;rsquo;s Happening in Birmingham, AL: I don&amp;rsquo;t start my M.Div. coursework at Beeson Divinity School until late August, but I&amp;rsquo;ve already started working at Beeson&amp;rsquo;s Media Center (follow our nascent Twitter account here). It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly convenient on-campus job.</description>

The second: The Daniel Award.

      <description>DISCLAIMER: there&amp;rsquo;s a fair bit about the Church that frustrates me.
However, I&amp;rsquo;d like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.
Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I&amp;rsquo;d like first to aim them at myself.</description>

      <description>To whomever the following concerns:
I&amp;rsquo;d like to apologize publicly to any persons I may have offended during the past few months of my student activism efforts at Cedarville University.
After all, I recognize that some of my statements/claims about the perceived injustices at my University have seemed quite shocking, especially without further context. So I apologize for the times when I put pithiness before precision and unwittingly ostracized many good people whom I was not intending to criticize at all.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been extremely frustrated with someone/thing you love?
That&amp;rsquo;s been my experience during my final year here at Cedarville University. See, I love this place. And that&amp;rsquo;s why I can&amp;rsquo;t stand it sometimes. There are still so many good and godly women and men here, so much potential for God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom. And that&amp;rsquo;s why recent decisions made by Cedarville Admins and Trustees are so heartbreaking. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this before (Open Letter).</description>

      <description>To my sisters and brothers in Christ, entrusted with the arduous task of leading and directing Cedarville University: greetings, grace, and peace.
Allow me to thank you all for your countless hours of service to this institution. I do not want to underestimate your care and concern for this place. In fact, I want to reassure you that I share your passion. Here at Cedarville I have been blessed with the opportunity of meeting, falling in love with, and marrying my wife.</description>

      <title>An Explanation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read my previous two blog posts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/&#34; title=&#34;Cedarville, Let there be Light. (pt. 1)&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cedarville, Let there be Light. (pt. 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-2/&#34; title=&#34;Cedarville, Let there be Light. (pt. 2)&#34;&gt;pt. 2)&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; please go do so before reading this post.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging in order to raise awareness of Cedarville University&amp;rsquo;s recent dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl from his teaching post. Using the University&amp;rsquo;s statement on Dr. Pahl, I&amp;rsquo;ve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above ( &lt;em&gt;in the statement&lt;/em&gt;, orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing today because the responses I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to those posts and questions have been mixed. Some think I&amp;rsquo;m doing something that is both &lt;em&gt;righteous&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;, respectfully raising awareness and asking uncomfortable-yet-necessary questions. Others think I&amp;rsquo;m being &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-biblical and &lt;em&gt;disrespectful&lt;/em&gt; in my approach, and that I should handle these matters privately (cf. &lt;a href=&#34;https://net.bible.org/#!l/bible%3AMatthew%2018%3A15-net_strongs__notes%3AMatthew%2018&#34;&gt;Matt 18:15-22&lt;/a&gt; and such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit biased toward the first reaction. It&amp;rsquo;s always more pleasant to think of your actions as both righteous and necessary, after all. However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t negate the careful line to walk in this situation. Several things must be held in Christ-honoring tension, such as &lt;strong&gt;boldness&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;respect&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;honesty&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;persistence&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;patience&lt;/strong&gt;, a hunger for &lt;strong&gt;justice&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an even &lt;em&gt;stronger&lt;/em&gt; craving for &lt;strong&gt;God&amp;rsquo;s perfect &lt;em&gt;shalom&lt;/em&gt; peace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Further Questions, All Relating to the University Statement on Dr. Pahl&amp;rsquo;s Dismissal: If Dr. Pahl&amp;rsquo;s book, The Beginning and the End, was controversial enough to lead to his dismissal, why was the book allowed to be used as a textbook last school year?
Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we trust the Bible professors&amp;rsquo; judgment in their selection of the book as a text? If we should, then was it worth firing Dr.</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-statement&#34;&gt;The Statement:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dr. Michael Pahl has been relieved of his teaching duties because he is unable to concur fully with each and every position of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx&#34;&gt;Cedarville University&amp;rsquo;s doctrinal statement&lt;/a&gt;.  This decision was made following a review by the University administration and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx&#34;&gt;trustees&lt;/a&gt; prompted by Dr. Pahl&amp;rsquo;s recent book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270&#34;&gt;The Beginning and the End:  Rereading Genesis&amp;rsquo;s Stories and Revelation&amp;rsquo;s Visions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pahl&amp;rsquo;s orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture&amp;rsquo;s inspiration, authority and infallibility.  He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students.  Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sacrificing Scripture on the Altars of Our Own Agendas</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/sacrificing-scripture-on-the-altars-of-our-own-agendas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx&#34;&gt;the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization&amp;rsquo;s agenda, and &lt;strong&gt;how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and then I learned more about how to study the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2012 19:19:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The following is an expanded version of the speech I gave at this year&amp;rsquo;s CU Scholar Dessert Reception.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I ever decided about Cedarville University was that I would not, under any circumstances, attend. Since my administrator’s son, Drew Flamm, worked in admissions at CU, I had been inundated since before I could remember with calls to become a yellow-jacket, and out of sheer stubbornness of heart, I refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost seven years later, and I stand before you all with the hopes of graduating next May. What changed? Well, for starters, God’s grace was, well, irresistible for even a stubborn high school student named Joshua Steele. While I don’t have time now to recount all the details, suffice it to say that receiving this scholarship was the final capstone of a tumultuous and miraculous college search process. I offer my sincerest thanks to the members of the selection committee. I stand before you now on nothing but a mountain of God’s grace, of which your generosity has been no small portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I near the end of my Cedarville experience, two things have made my journey thus far particularly unforgettable and life-changing: **&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wedding Vows: My Personal Take on the Traditional Version</title>

      <description>The Traditional Wedding Vows In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know, the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; wedding vows - in English, at least - are found in the Book of Common Prayer.
In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, the marriage vows read as follows:
I M. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worſe, for richer for poorer, in ſickneſs and in health, to love and to cheriſh, till death us do part, according to God’s holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.</description>

      <description>My Valedictorian Address, a Poem The following is my valedictorian speech, delivered at my high school graduation in 2009. As you&amp;rsquo;ll see below, the majority of the speech was an original poem. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to be a bit embarrassed by the poem today, but I&amp;rsquo;m also proud that I went for it. Let me know what you think!
GRADUATION! Such a mix of emotions comes with this simple word…</description>

From a Grateful Son - A Poem for My Mother Thank you, Mom, for having me that day so long ago. Thank you, then, for holding me and now for letting go. Thank you, Mom, for giving me your patience, time, and care.</description>
