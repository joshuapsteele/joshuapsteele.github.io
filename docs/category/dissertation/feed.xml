      <description>Came across this Barth quote in Church Dogmatics II/2 this morning. I really like it, because it&amp;rsquo;s a good reminder that Barth valued the Bible. His distinction between the Bible as witness to the Word of God and Jesus Christ as the Word of God did not cause him to abandon the Scriptural witness.
It is as well to remind ourselves, at the conclusion of this analysis, that the question: What ought we to do?</description>

      <description>Tomorrow, I defend the proposal for my dissertation. For now, the dissertation is tentatively titled: &amp;ldquo;Scriptural, but Not Religious: Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion.&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;elevator pitch&amp;rdquo; for the dissertation. Feedback appreciated.
Scriptural, but Not Religious: Barth, Bonhoeffer, and a Biblical Critique of Religion My project traces its origins to a single classroom discussion question in the Spring of 2015. The question was this: &amp;ldquo;In what ways is Bonhoeffer&amp;rsquo;s understanding of religion similar to, and different from, that of Barth?</description>
