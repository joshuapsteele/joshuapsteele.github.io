    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>To whomever the following concerns:</p>
<p><strong>I’d like to apologize publicly to any persons I may have offended during the past few months of my student activism efforts at Cedarville University.</strong></p>
<p>After all, I recognize that some of my statements/claims about the perceived injustices at my University have seemed quite shocking, especially without further context. So I apologize for the times when I put pithiness before precision and unwittingly ostracized many good people whom I was not intending to criticize at all.</p>
<p>Many times my frustration – directed at the nebulous group of trustees and administrators most directly responsible for things like the White Papers, the firing of Michael Pahl, and the firing of Carl Ruby – has seeped over and negatively affected some of the good people I’d like to defend and advocate for, if it were their necks on the chopping block.</p>
<p>There are MANY great people at Cedarville University in between those who’ve been fired and those who’ve made the firing decisions, and I don’t want to overlook them or accidentally attack them. If you’re a member of that group and you’ve been put-off by my recent words and actions, I truly am sorry. Please forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>I’d also like to apologize publicly for any embarrassment I’ve caused to the Kingdom of God in this process.</strong></p>
<p>That is, while I’m NOT sorry for seeking prophetically to address injustices being committed by the people of God against the people of God, I AM sorry if I’ve given the impression to those on the outside looking in that this is how Christianity always goes.</p>
<p>(This is not a retraction of my activism efforts, for I am sincerely convinced that the University has committed institutional sins, if you will, in its recent decisions.)</p>
<p>However, I would like to remind all “outsiders” that following Jesus of Nazareth is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>not</strong> </span>supposed to look like the current controversies which plague Cedarville University. Christianity is more than just intrigue and infighting, although those things will always be a part of Christendom until the end of days because us Christians are messed-up people just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Would you <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>please forgive me, and please forgive us Christians, for doing a poor job of representing Yahweh to you?</strong> </span></p>
<p>He is a God of unity, justice, and peace, and yet far too often we, as his people, miserably fail at embodying those things.</p>
<p>In the end, Yahweh has told us human beings what is good: to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. (Micah 6:8.)</p>
<p>Justice, mercy, and humility.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for when I’ve failed to embody <span style="text-decoration:underline;">mercy</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">humility</span> in my pursuit of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">justice</span>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Joshua Steele</p>
