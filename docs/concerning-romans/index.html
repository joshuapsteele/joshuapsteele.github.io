Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it concerned the chaos at Cedarville University!
However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to my shameful alma mater at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the 2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS tomorrow (see my previous post, and come to my presentation at 5:00pm in room S009!), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.">

<p>Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/">concerned the chaos at Cedarville University</a>!</p>
<p>However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">my shameful alma mater</a> at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets">2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS</a> tomorrow (see<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/07/my-regional-ets-presentation-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/"> my previous post</a>, and come to my presentation at <strong>5:00pm in room S009!</strong>), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, given the current discussion in my New Testament Theology — two classes on Romans — I thought I might re-post two of my previous works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/06/28/romans-revisited-pt-1/">Romans. Revisited.</a> (or <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/05/03/the-argument-story-of-romans/">“The Argument-Story of Romans”</a>):</strong> my final write-up for Dr. Chris Miller’s course on Romans and Galatians at Cedarville University. We were due to have an oral exam on the last day of class, in which we talked-through the logic of the epistle. I wrote this summary the night before the exam, and was given the opportunity to present it to the class. I now present it to you! Feel free to give me some push-back!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/romans-13/">Romans 13:1-7 — A Contextually-Appropriate Reading</a>:</strong> a paper I wrote for the same course as mentioned above, in which I defend the following thesis: <strong>“Far from being a comprehensive condensation of the apostle’s beliefs regarding any and all governments past and present, [Romans 13:1-7] is a specific and historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, discouraging them from political unrest, disobedience, and rebellion in order to protect their testimony and the effectiveness of the Roman church in the gospel mission.”</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all for now. Grace and Peace.</p>
