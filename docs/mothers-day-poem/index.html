<p>Thank you, Mom, for having me<br>
that day so long ago.<br>
Thank you, then, for holding me<br>
and now for letting go.<br>
Thank you, Mom, for giving me<br>
your patience, time, and care.<br>
And thank you, Mom, for loving me<br>
for always being there ‚Äì</p>
<p>Thanks so much for teaching me<br>
both how to read and write.<br>
For every single grueling day<br>
and every sleepless night.<br>
Thank you, Mom, for aiming high,<br>
for helping me succeed.<br>
For never letting me forget<br>
that you believe in me.</p>
<p>Mom, you mean so much to me.<br>
My words cannot convey<br>
The debt of love, of care-filled work<br>
That I should rightly pay.<br>
Though distance, time, and life itself<br>
may take me far away,<br>
I‚Äôll always be your little boy<br>
with these three words to say ‚Äì</p>
<p>‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù</p>

<p>What‚Äôs next? Well, whether you enjoyed the poem or not ‚Äì or whether or not Mother‚Äôs Day is even nearby on the calendar ‚Äì I think you know what you should go and do next after reading this post:</p>
