<p>“Class Limited to Women” … I know, ludicrous. Especially considering Joy Fagan’s previous track record of making the first class, Scriptural Interpretation of Gender Issues (or SIGI), a truly excellent course by all accounts from former students, male and female.</p>

<p>Well, judging by my blog stats for the past 48 hours — as compared with the past few months — I’d get many more views on this post if it <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/18/cedarville-2/">concerned the chaos at Cedarville University</a>!</p>
<p>However, my schedule and blood pressure won’t allow me to devote any more time to <a href="http://fiatlux125.wordpress.com/">my shameful alma mater</a> at the moment. I’ve got a presentation at the <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/ets">2014 Southeast Regional Meeting of ETS</a> tomorrow (see<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2014/03/07/my-regional-ets-presentation-reconciliation-and-the-lack-thereof/"> my previous post</a>, and come to my presentation at <strong>5:00pm in room S009!</strong>), and even though Beeson Divinity School’s Spring Break is right around the corner, I’ve still got a fair share of reading to get done.</p>

I thought I’d share it, just in case anyone is considering Cedarville as a choice for college. I’d still strongly recommend you attend another institution, where you can trust the administration.

<p>======</p>
<p>“Dear friends,</p>
<p>“Every. Single. Week. I am contacted by people who attend and work at CU who are just miserable. I pray about what to say and what not to say; my motives aren’t malicious. This morning I was reading about Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and how he couldn’t believe that the Christians in Germany remained silent about Hitler or actively conspired with Hitler to get rid of the Jews. This situation at CU is no Germany. But faculty and staff at the school I loved are now forced into silence. They’re being oppressed. If they speak, they’ll lose their jobs. Their FB accounts and e-mails are monitored. A coup occurred at CU as it did at Southern Seminary, Southwestern Seminary, and Southeastern Seminary at the hands of Paige Patterson. Paige Patterson is now a trustee and mentor to the new president, Dr. White. Many who made decisions who fought to keep us and our friends (Bible profs/Carl Ruby and others) at the school told us that it was a coup. So the current administration doesn’t care about what fac/staff think. And students are there temporarily so….The chair of the board has said that he is willing to take the school down to 1200 to get their way. Shawn and I can afford to speak up because we didn’t sign a non-disclosure agreement. We are thriving and not bitter. But, I do get angry about how people are being treated. Thank God Shawn got a job right away and didn’t have to worry about providing for his family. Every single person who knows me will tell you I deliberate about my words. I am tired of the pain people are going through. And so I speak up because I can. I think this is the last chance for those currently there to give an outcry. Otherwise it’s over for them. They have moved to forbid egalitarians from teaching there, too. Next year, if you cannot say you are comp, you cannot work there. Only money and power can accomplish such a coup. I have no money or power. But, I have the freedom to speak up. So this below is just more evidence of what is going on. Students pray for your professors and staff. Many are suffering and can’t even tell you. Many of their jobs are on the line. They continue to clean house while silencing people. Pay attention to who is no longer there and from where they hire their new faculty. I’ve lost count of who is gone. People have to decide whether or not they’ll feed their families or speak up. So please, speak up on their behalf!</p>

<p>Our goal is to assist <a href="http://www.abweperu.org/page_family/pagefamily.php?id=12">the Stone families</a> (Dave &amp; Evelyn; Jonathan &amp; Angela) in their various local ministries, including:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://luzdelcaminosb.wix.com/luzdelcamino/">Luz del Camino Iglesia</a> (Church)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.centroprenatal.org/">Vida Nueva Centro Prenatal</a> (Pregnancy Center)</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of Beeson’s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to “<em>expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting</em>.” In addition to fulfilling this goal, we believe that this trip to Peru will be <strong>influential in determining the future involvement of both our families in global missions</strong>. God’s given each of us unique gifts — ranging from medicine to math, theology to linguistics. But <strong>He’s blessed us all with a heart for His global Gospel and his global Church</strong>.</p>

      <p>Over the break between semesters at <a href="http://www.beesondivinity.com/">Beeson Divinity School</a>, I’m reviewing Bruce Waltke’s <a href="http://www.eerdmans.com/Products/6736/the-dance-between-god-and-humanity.aspx"><em>The Dance Between God and Humanity: Reading the Bible Today as the People of God</em></a> and Philip Goodwin’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Translating-English-Bible-Relevance-Deconstruction/dp/0227173910">Translating the English Bible: From Relevance to Deconstruction</a></em> for <a href="http://www.hope.ac.uk/theologicalbookreview/">Liverpool Hope University’s Theological Book Review</a>.</p>

However, I’d like to share the following quotes on <em>Deconstructive Literalism</em> and <em>The Perfect Translation</em>, because I find the concepts intriguing as a student of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence">Eugene Nida’s dynamic or functional equivalence</a> (when it comes to both NT Greek and modern Spanish), and a newcomer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_theory">relevance theory</a>, which Goodwin uses to provide a way forward in the shadow of the KJV tradition. More on that later. In the meantime:</p>
