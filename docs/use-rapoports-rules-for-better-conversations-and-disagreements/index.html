<p>First formulated by mathematical psychologist Anatol Rapoport and discussed by Daniel Dennett (<a href="https://amzn.to/2NmrH4m"><em>Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking</em></a>, 31–35), here they are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”</p>
<p>2: You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</p>
<p>3: You should mention anything you have learned from your target.</p>
<p>4: Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How would our conversations—everything from family dinner to classroom discussions to church business meetings—look different if we put these rules into practice?</p>
