In biblical terms, I\u0026rsquo;m called to \u0026ldquo;equip the saints for the work of ministry\u0026rdquo; and to \u0026ldquo;build up the body of Christ\u0026rdquo; (Eph. 4:12).\nNow, on the one hand, this means that I’m not supposed to do all the work of ministry myself! I am not an expert who asks the non-specialists to step aside so that the real work can be done by a professional. No! The “ministry” is done by all the saints, not just the ordained clergy.\nAnd yet, on the other hand, I must set the saints a good example in my life and work. I must constantly grow in the knowledge and love of God if I am to be \u0026ldquo;a messenger, watchman, and steward of the Lord\u0026rdquo; who can \u0026ldquo;teach, to warn, to feed, and to provide for the Lord\u0026rsquo;s family\u0026rdquo; (2019 BCP, p. 489).\nPastoral ministry requires a lifelong devotion to the Word of God. As my bishop put it when I was ordained to the priesthood, \u0026ldquo;the demands of this holy Office are so great\u0026rdquo; that I must \u0026ldquo;lay aside all worldly distractions and take care to direct all that [I] do to this purpose: read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the Scriptures\u0026rdquo; (2019 BCP, p. 489).\nPut simply: Bible study—and not just for sermon preparation—is essential for pastoral ministry. I will not be able to \u0026ldquo;frame [my] conduct, and that of my household and those committed to [my] care, according to the doctrine and discipline of Christ\u0026rdquo; (2019 BCP, p. 489) unless I\u0026rsquo;m saying \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo; to enough other things to protect the time and space I need to digest the Scriptures.\nBut, of course, I can’t accomplish any of this on my own. I need to “pray earnestly” for the “Holy Spirit to enlighten [my] mind and strengthen [my] resolve” (2019 BCP, p. 489). To equip the saints for the work of ministry, I need to saturate my life with Scripture and prayer. This is the two-stroke engine, as it were, that drives a genuinely successful ministry of Word and Sacrament. It’s the part of my ordination vows that enables me to do the other things I vowed to do:\n\u0026ldquo;to minister the doctrine, sacraments, and discipline of Christ, as the Lord has commanded and this Church has received them, according to the commandments of God, so that [I] may teach the people committed to [my] charge with all diligence to keep and observe them\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;to banish and drive away from the Body of Christ all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God’s Word\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;to use both public and private admonitions and exhortations, to the weak as well as the strong within [my] charge, as need shall require and occasion be given\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;to frame and fashion my own life and the life of my family, according to the doctrine of Christ, and to make myself and them, as much as I am able, a wholesome example and pattern to the flock of Christ\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;to maintain and set forward, as much as I am able, quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people, and especially among those who are or shall be committed to my charge\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;to obey my Bishop and other chief Ministers who, according to the Canons of this Church, may have charge and authority over [me], following with a glad mind and a good will their godly admonitions, and submitting [myself] to their godly judgments\u0026rdquo; (2019 BCP, pp. 490–91). Such is the ministry of Word and Sacrament to which I have been called and ordained within Christ’s Church.\nAt the end of the day, as a pastor, I am not a CEO, guru, or celebrity speaker. Instead, I am an under-shepherd, with delegated authority from the Good Shepherd to feed and equip his flock to do the work he has called us all to do.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/portfolio/philosophy-of-ministry/","summary":"Every Christian is a theologian.\nI consider it my life\u0026rsquo;s work to help \u0026ldquo;everyday Christians\u0026rdquo; grow in their knowledge and love of God so that we all can put our gifts to good use by joining with God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive work in the world.

They both grew up in nominally Roman Catholic homes, and came to relationship with Christ shortly before my birth. When I came along, their church environment was a mixture between conservative Baptist and non-denominational. And yet, their departure from the Roman Catholic Church was still recent enough that my grandmother persuaded them to have me baptized as a baby. This was when the first seeds of faith were sown into my life.\nAt age five, I prayed the “sinner’s prayer” after my dad shared the gospel with me. But after I read the first Left Behind book at age ten, I was terrified about my eternal destiny. After all, I could not directly remember my mindset at age five. Was I really sincere, or did I merely pray the prayer to make my dad happy? Searching for certainty, I lost many hours of sleep worrying that my family members were being raptured without me that very moment.\nAlthough my views on the rapture have since changed, I look back upon this spiritual struggle with gratitude to God for providing me with guides, my pastor and parents, who pointed me to the Bible to prevent me from turning my faith inward on itself, from basing my salvation in my sincerity rather than on God’s faithfulness to redeem. Although I would not now advise this to my younger self (I view my Roman Catholic infant baptism as my valid baptism), I was baptized again at age ten, in a public declaration of my rededicated faith.\nAlthough I languished in spiritual apathy and bitterness during junior high, God used a friendship with a missionary-kid and a trip to Brazil to revitalize my faith and give me a love for foreign languages and cultures. In high school, God used a committed youth pastor to encourage my development into a student leader and worship leader. As a missions bookend to my high school experience, I was given a glimpse of how God could use me for his glory when our youth group traveled to Mexico City and I led bilingual worship and translated for my peers.\nAfter returning from Mexico, however, my first opportunity to preach wrecked my plans for the future (I wanted to be a mechanical engineer). As I prepared my first sermon, it bothered me that I knew much more about calculus, physics, and Spanish than I did about Scripture. Wanting to learn more about the gospel to preach that good news to others, I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Pre-seminary Bible just three weeks before my first semester of college.\nCollege (Cedarville University) I had a lot going for me as I entered college. Although I am the son of a bricklayer and a homemaker, I was able to go to a Christian university because God miraculously provided a full-ride scholarship. Furthermore, the conservative Baptist environment of my high school days had given me a love for the gospel, for prayer, and for studying Scripture.\nAnd yet, I suffered from a nasty combination of piety and pride. I was full of myself and I wanted to be really good at theology, to prove to myself and my parents that I was not crazy for abandoning engineering. I had also hidden an addiction to pornography throughout high school. God had some chains to break and an ego to deflate. Thankfully, although pride and lust are still temptations that I battle through accountability, confession, repentance, and prayer, God both humbled me and set me free from bondage to porn.\nIn college, I fell in love with a nursing student from Pennsylvania (we got married during the summer before our senior year, August 4, 2012). I also fell in love with the gospel. My college theology professors were invaluable guides, first revealing the shallowness of my theology, and then pointing out the depths of the theological task. They demonstrated what it looked like to be in love with the God of the gospel and to be faithful with the intellectual gifts he provides. I emerged from their classrooms wanting to advance God’s kingdom by investing in the Church academically, pastorally, and globally—as part- professor, pastor, and missionary.\nNevertheless, my college years ended on a painful note. In what I now refer to as the “Cedarville Purge,” the most conservative constituents of the university exacted revenge for a shift to moderate evangelicalism that had taken place in the years just before I arrived as a freshman. My professors were forced out because being a moderate evangelical was too liberal for the university’s new vision. I and others protested the shameful actions of the trustees and administrators—but we failed. Although God was gracious to provide other jobs for my professors, it was a very painful experience during a formative period in my life.\nSeminary (Beeson Divinity School) Given the unhappy ending to my college career, I am extremely thankful that God led me to Beeson Divinity School and St. Peter’s Anglican Church in Birmingham, AL. The theological tradition and breadth of Anglicanism, as well as the ecumenical spirit of Beeson, were breaths of fresh air and balms to my wounded spirit. In not throwing out the theological baby with the bathwater, it was healthy for me to step back from the prophetic fervor of my final days at Cedarville, and instead to devote myself to being faithful with the gifts and opportunities God gave me in Alabama.\nI learned a lot as a seminarian. And I was also given the opportunity as a youth minister at St. Peter’s to teach others about the God of the gospel who has captured my thoughts. The joys and challenges of student ministry reinforced my identity as a student and a teacher. While I used to think I could be satisfied as a professor even without a pastoral role in the Church, my time as a youth minister in seminary changed that. If forced to choose between the Church and the academy, I would choose pastoral ministry every time. I was ordained as a deacon in October 2016, shortly before completing my M.Div.\nPh.D. and The Priesthood (Wheaton College) Nevertheless, in the interests of becoming a pastor-theologian, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. I entered the Ph.D. program at Wheaton College in 2017. Since then, God has blessed me and my family in many ways. He provided fulfilling work as a Nurse Practitioner for my wife, Rachel. He provided me with a part-time job as the Managing Editor of Anglican Compass. And he also blessed us with two wonderful children (Eva in July 2018, Andrew in July 2020).\nAnother blessing has been our church family at Church of the Savior. When we left Alabama, I was really anxious about finding a place to serve as clergy while a full-time doctoral student. Our rector, Kevin Miller, has been incredibly supportive as a mentor. He’s given me opportunities to serve and he sponsored my ordination to the priesthood in November 2019—all while allowing my roles in preaching, pastoral care, student ministry, worship, church website, and church administration to change over time as my Ph.D. commitments necessitated.\nNevertheless, I have also faced several challenges in the past couple years. I ran into huge dissertation roadblocks right before the COVID-19 lockdown in March, when I lost access to my library carrell for 5 months. These obstacles, plus employment uncertainty, the arrival of our second child, and increased isolation from the church due to virtual-only worship made 2020 one of the most difficult years of my life.\nI made the decision to start medication and therapy for depression and anxiety in fall 2020. In early winter, after a lot of prayer, deliberation, and seeking godly counsel, I made the difficult decision to hit pause (“excused program leave”) on my Ph.D. program for a year for the sake of my mental health. Since making that decision, I’ve grown more and more confident that stepping away from the Ph.D. for at least a year is the right thing to do.\nWhere does that leave me? My rocky road as a Ph.D. student has convinced me even more that my heart lies with the Church, not with the Academy. I thank God for the blessings of formal theological education, and I’d like to do everything I can to help bridge the gap between the Church and the Academy by making gospel-centered theological education accessible to each and every Christian, and not just for specialists!\nSo, I’m still a student and a teacher at heart. And I’m still trying to discern whether finishing my Ph.D. is the right decision at this point in my life. But, at the end of the day, I’m a pastor at heart. And, whether or not I finish my Ph.D., the following words from my ordination to the priesthood are my North Star in ministry:\n“Work diligently, with your whole heart, to bring those in your care into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of God, and to maturity in Christ, that there may be among you neither error in religion nor immorality in life. Finally, equip and lead your Congregation to proclaim tirelessly the Gospel of Jesus Christ.”\nMay it be so. Amen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/portfolio/my-story/","summary":"(Note: for a much briefer profile of what I\u0026rsquo;m like and what makes me tick as a worker, read this self-assessment.)\nFrom Childhood to College God’s faithfulness to me is linked with his faithfulness to my parents.

I really like it, because it\u0026rsquo;s a good reminder that Barth valued the Bible. His distinction between the Bible as witness to the Word of God and Jesus Christ as the Word of God did not cause him to abandon the Scriptural witness.\nIt is as well to remind ourselves, at the conclusion of this analysis, that the question: What ought we to do?, is the question which was put to Peter and the other apostles (Ac. 2:37f.) by those who heard Peter’s sermon on the day of Pentecost. This means that, although we ourselves have to ask it, we must not ask it of ourselves. We must ask it of God, of the God who has revealed Himself to us and has given us the witnesses of His revelation. It is a question which is put by Holy Scripture, and therefore we must put it to Holy Scripture as the witness to God’s revelation. That the sovereign decision of God confronts us and our decisions objectively in Jesus Christ is, as we have seen, the supreme criterion of all ethical reflection. But Jesus Christ cannot be separated from His apostles, from the whole witness which underlies the community of God in the form of Israel, and then of the Christian Church. We hear Him as we hear His witnesses. It is in their testimony that the divine command is always to be sought and will always be found as the sovereign divine decision. We must not be surprised, then, if—in very different forms—we are always given what is in fact the one answer: “Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”\n( Emphasis added.)\nSource: Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics: The Doctrine of God, Part 2, vol. 2 (London; New York: T\u0026amp;T Clark, 2004), 661.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-the-bible-and-what-we-ought-to-do/","summary":"Came across this Barth quote in Church Dogmatics II/2 this morning.

Nothing is lost; in Christ all things are taken up, preserved, albeit in transfigured form, transparent, clear, liberated from the torment of self-serving demands. Christ brings all this back, indeed, as God intended, without being distorted by sin. The doctrine originating in Eph. 1:10 of the restoration of all things, ἀνακεφαλαίωσις—re-capitulatio (Irenaeus), is a magnificent and consummately consoling thought. (DBWE 8:229–30)\n\u0026hellip;\nI also occasionally think of the p 231 from the Augustinian “O bone Jesu,” by Schütz. In a certain way, namely, in its devotion—ecstatic, aching, and nevertheless so pure—isn’t this passage something like the “restoration” of all earthly desire? By the way, “restoration” is, of course, not to be confused with “sublimation”! “Sublimation” is σάρξ, (and pietistic?!), whereas “restoration” is spirit, meant not in the sense of “spiritualization” (which is also σάρξ) but of καινή κτίσις through the πνεῦμα ἅγιον. (DBWE 8:230–31)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s intriguing (to me) because, in other prison letters, Bonhoeffer uses \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; and/vs. \u0026ldquo;flesh,\u0026rdquo; as well as the word \u0026ldquo;restoration,\u0026rdquo; to describe Barth\u0026rsquo;s theological critique of religion.\nOn April 30, 1944, Bonhoeffer wrote:\nHow can Christ become Lord of the religionless as well? Is there such a thing as a religionless Christian? If religion is only the garb in which Christianity is clothed—and this garb has looked very different in different ages—what then is religionless Christianity? Barth, who is the only one to have begun thinking along these lines, nevertheless did not pursue these thoughts all the way, did not think them through, but ended up with a positivism of revelation, which in the end essentially remained a restoration. (DBWE 8:363–64, emphasis added)\nThen, on June 8, 1944, Bonhoeffer wrote:\nBarth was the first to recognize the error of all these attempts (which were basically all still sailing in the wake of liberal theology, without intending to do so) in that they all aim to save some room for religion in the world or over against the world. He led the God of Jesus Christ forward to battle against religion, πνεῦμα against σάρξ. This remains his greatest merit (the second edition of The Epistle to the Romans, despite all the neo-Kantian eggshells!). Through his later Dogmatics he has put the church in a position to carry this distinction in principle all the way through. (DBWE 8:428–29, emphasis added)\nFurthermore, \u0026ldquo;sublimation\u0026rdquo; is a very important word for Barth\u0026rsquo;s theological critique of religion as found in Church Dogmatics I/2, §17, \u0026ldquo;The Revelation of God as the Sublimation [Aufhebung, sometimes translated \u0026ldquo;abolition\u0026rdquo;] of Religion\u0026rdquo;!\nFor a moment, I thought I might be on to something here. What was going on with Bonhoeffer\u0026rsquo;s collocation of \u0026ldquo;flesh,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;spirit,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;restoration,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sublimation\u0026rdquo;?\nHowever, I took a closer look and realized that, in the December 19, 1943 letter, Bonhoeffer uses the word Wiederbringung for \u0026ldquo;restoration,\u0026rdquo; as opposed to Restauration, which he uses to describe Barth\u0026rsquo;s positivism of revelation in the April 30, 1944 letter.\nFurthermore, he uses Sublimierung for \u0026ldquo;sublimation,\u0026rdquo; and not Aufhebung, the term Barth uses in CD I/2.\nSo now I\u0026rsquo;m trying to parse out the differences between \u0026ldquo;Wiederbringung\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Restauration,\u0026rdquo; and between \u0026ldquo;Sublimierung\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Aufhebung.\u0026rdquo; Not to mention the connection between Barth and Bonhoeffer on the theme of spirit vs. flesh!\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/spirit-flesh-restoration-and-sublimation/","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s an intriguing passage in Bonhoeffer\u0026rsquo;s Letters and Papers from Prison where he discusses the relationship between \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;flesh,\u0026rdquo; in the context of discussing \u0026ldquo;restoration\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sublimation,\u0026rdquo; in the context of discussing lyrics from certain hymns and songs that were meaningful to him in prison.\nHere it is, from a December 19, 1943 (the Fourth Sunday of Advent) letter to Eberhard Bethge:\nIn recent weeks this line has been running through my head over and over: “Calm your hearts, dear friends; / whatever plagues you, / whatever fails you, / I will restore it all.","title":"Spirit, Flesh, Restoration, and Sublimation"},{"content":"Last night, the scale read 192.4.

Their ‘God’ does not redeem his creation, but allows free course to the unrighteousness of men; does not declare himself to be God, but is the complete affirmation of the course of the world and of men as it is. This is intolerable, for, in spite of the highest honours we offer him for his adornment, he is, in fact, ‘No-God’. The cry of revolt against such a god is nearer the truth than is the sophistry with which men attempt to justify him ( Romans, 40).\nIndeed, for Barth, the quicker the enterprise of worshipping the “No-God” runs aground, the better, for only after we have been disabused of our false god will we be ready to encounter the true God.\nThis is similar to Bonhoeffer, who, writing to Bethge on July 16, 1944, says:\nThis is the crucial distinction between Christianity and all religions. Human religiosity directs people in need to the power of God in the world, God as deus ex machina. The Bible directs people toward the powerlessness and the suffering of God; only the suffering God can help. To this extent, one may say that the previously described development toward the world’s coming of age, which has cleared the way by eliminating a false notion of God, frees us to see the God of the p 480 Bible, who gains ground and power in the world by being powerless ( Letters and Papers from Prison, DBWE 8:479-480).\nBoth Barth and Bonhoeffer thought that the elimination of a false notion of God was a good thing, even if it did not appear to be a good thing, because such an elimination was a preparation to encounter the true God.\nHowever, Barth and Bonhoeffer differed in their descriptions of the false gods that humans are prone to create and worship.\nFor Barth in Romans, the ‘No-God’ is revealed to be a false god because he merely affirms the course of world history and the unrighteous desires of human beings, without judgment and without redemption.\nHowever, for Bonhoeffer in Letters and Papers from Prison, the false god is revealed to be false because he is a god of power/strength, the projected opposite of human weakness, whereas the God of the Bible is a God who (1) can affirm human strength and (2) redeems through weakness and suffering, as seen in the life of Jesus.\nFurthermore, for Barth the “No-God” is able to be known directly, he is close at hand, whereas the true God is hidden even in the midst of his self-revelation, never able to be known or grasped directly. (See, e.g., Romans, 38, 51.)\nHowever, for Bonhoeffer, even early in his career, “God is present, that is, not in eternal nonobjectivity but—to put it quite provisionally for now—‘haveable’ [,habbar‘], graspable in the Word within the church\u0026quot; ( Act and Being, DBWE 2:91).\nIn Letters and Papers from Prison, it is the false God that is distant, encountering human beings only at the border [Grenze] of their possibilities. The true God, for Bonhoeffer, always encounters human beings in the center [Mitte] of their lives.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-and-bonhoeffer-on-religions-false-gods/","summary":"In The Epistle to the Romans, Barth writes the following concerning the false image of God at the heart of religion:\nWhat men on this side resurrection name ‘God’ is most characteristically not God.

Instead, human disobedience revealed the distinction and led to the rise of religion as worship of God, an independent action over against their creator. In the Church Dogmatics (esp. CD III/1, 257–76, but also IV/1, 418–78), Barth interpreted the knowledge of good and evil as God’s prerogative to judge between what ought to be and what ought not to be.\nThe prohibition of eating from the tree of knowledge thereby revealed the creator/creature distinction and was meant to prompt humans to acknowledge and praise their creator—to worship God in a proper way.

This book enables readers to look with fresh eyes at the theologies of Barth and Bonhoeffer and offers new insights for reading the history of modern theology. It also helps churches see how they can be creative minorities in societies that have forgotten God.\nTranslated by a senior American scholar of Christian theology and an accomplished translator, this is the first major translation of Krötke\u0026rsquo;s work in the English language.

Course Requirements Participation \u0026amp; Assigned Reading - 20% Participation will be based on class discussions, which will require students to come to class prepared by having read thoughtfully the assigned readings.\nStudents will be expected to read all of the required texts in their entirety as indicated on the course schedule. This reading needs to be complete prior to the designated class session and students will be graded based on their ability to participate actively in the discussions relative to those readings.\nKeep in mind that additional articles may be assigned during the course.\nReading Quizzes - 20% Once a week (the first class session of the week), students will take a brief reading quiz on the main points of the assigned reading (usually from McGrath’s Theology: The Basics) for that day.\nReading Presentations - 20% Once a week (the second class session of the week), students will give brief presentations on the assigned primary source readings from McGrath’s Theology: The Basic Readings.\nIn each presentation, the student will have 2 minutes to: - read a one-sentence summary of the passage that they’ve written - praise one aspect/point of the reading - critique one aspect/point of the reading.\nThe rest of the class will then spend ˜5 minutes responding to each presentation, before moving on to the next presentation.\nEach student will give 3-4 presentations over the course of the semester. The schedule for reading presentations will be assigned by the professor at the beginning of the course.\nDon’t like public speaking? That’s OK. I encourage you to manuscript your presentation and read it.\nOne-Minute Papers - 10% Over the course of the semester (5 times), students will be given a few minutes in class to write out their answer to a reflection question, such as:\nWhat was the muddies/least clear idea you encountered in class this week? What was the most important idea you encountered in class this week? What important questions remain unanswered for you? These brief papers will be left with or emailed to the professor, and will be graded on a pass/fail basis for each paper (i.e., if you do all 5, you’ll get full credit, if you do 4/5, you’ll get 80% credit).\nFinal Paper - 30% Over the course of the semester, students will work on a 3,000 word essay on a theological topic of their choice (within the broad range of theological topics covered in Jenson and McGrath).\nI expect you to incorporate at least two sources in addition to the assigned readings in this class.\nOverall, this project will be worth 30% of the final grade. However, it will be completed in stages. Students will:\nPick a topic and let the professor know by the fourth class session (end of week 2). Submit a 1-2 page outline, abstract, and bibliography (5% of final grade) by the tenth class session (end of week 5). Let me know what additional sources you’re thinking about using. Receive a graded outline/abstract with feedback by the twelfth class session (end of week 6). Submit a 3,000 word final paper (15% of final grade) by the twentieth class session (end of week 10). Receive a graded final paper with feedback by the twenty-fourth class session (end of week 12). Submit a 3,000 word revised final paper (10% of final grade) by the thirtieth class session (end of week 15, end of term). You’ll be expected to give me a one paragraph summary of how you’ve improved the paper.

Students should submit assignments on the dates indicated by the course schedule. Students with special needs or disabilities should speak to the professor early in the semester to facilitate adequate and suitable arrangements to meet the relevant needs. For academic discourse, spoken and written, the faculty expects students to use gender inclusive language for human beings Students will be expected to attend every class session except in the case of sickness or when an absence has been arranged with the professor. Missing more than 20% of the class hours will result in a grade reduction. Class Schedule SECTION ONE: THE NATURE OF THEOLOGY AND AN EXAMPLE OF THEOLOGY Week 1: What is theology? How do we do it?

Rationale for Textbooks These days, we’re spoiled for choice when it comes to theology textbooks. I don’t claim to have chosen the very best textbooks, but here are some of my reasons for choosing the texts I did, as well as my reasons for not choosing 5 books that almost made the cut.\nWhy I Chose Our Texts Jenson, A Theology in Outline I wanted us to read a brief book that (1) showcased a theologian doing theology, and not merely surveying theology and (2) gave a taste for how the various aspects of Christian doctrine hang together. Jenson’s book, comprised of lectures he gave to undergraduate students at Princeton at the end of his career, fit the bill nicely. It will give us a taste of what Christian theology can look like as a whole before we dive into its parts. I also hope that it provides enough grist for the mill early in the semester so that you can choose topics that you’re interested in for your papers.\nKibbe, From Topic to Thesis Speaking of papers, Kibbe’s book is an excellent primer for theological research and writing. Because people come into this course from different academic backgrounds, some kind of introduction to what research and writing should look like in theology is necessary. I know of no better bang for the buck (and for the page) than this recent book from Kibbe.\nMcGrath, Theology: The Basics \u0026amp; Theology: The Basic Readings I’ll admit that it was difficult to choose between these two shorter books and McGrath’s longer offerings, Christian Theology: An Introduction and The Christian Theology Reader.\nAll of McGrath’s textbooks are excellent in that they expose the reader to the main contours of Christian theology and how those contours have developed over the history of the Church. Furthermore, McGrath teaches you how to engage with primary texts, and gives you guided practice in doing so. Finally, these textbooks have stood the test of time, going through multiple revisions that have incorporated classroom feedback from around the world.\nIn the end, I went with the shorter options because I’d like us to have time to engage with the works quite thoroughly, instead of feeling like we have to struggle to keep up with the longer books.\nNevertheless, I’ll be drawing from McGrath’s longer books frequently in my lectures, and I highly recommend them to you for after this course if this semester successfully whets your appetite for Christian theology!\nThe “Top 5” that Almost Made the Cut (Note: these are in alphabetical order, not ranked.)\nErickson, Christian Theology Erickson’s work is a classic and would be well worth your time and money to purchase and use as a reference after this course. However, it’s almost 1200 pages long. While that allows him to address many topics that aren’t covered in McGrath’s shorter books, I felt it was too long of a text to require for this semester.\nGrudem, Systematic Theology Grudem’s is perhaps the best-known systematic theology in evangelical circles. It has many merits, especially the extent to which it integrates biblical material at every turn (the subtitle is, appropriately, “An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine”). However, it’s just over 1200 pages long—too long, in my opinion, for a one semester survey.\nFelker Jones, Practicing Christian Doctrine This work isn’t a classic, yet! I do suspect, however, that it will gain in popularity because, coming in at under 250 pages, it’s a fantastic introduction to Christian doctrine and the importance of both “thinking and living theologically” (from the book’s subtitle). However, while the book has more of an emphasis on living theologically than McGrath does, it contains less guidance and practice of engaging with primary sources. No single book can do everything, of course, but the associated reader was a big reason why I chose McGrath over Felker Jones.\nOden, Classic Christianity This book is a wonderful resource for finding out what the consensus teaching of the Church, emphasis on the early Church, has been on the various main topics of Christian theology—“classic consensual ecumenical teaching,” as Oden puts it. It reads almost like a systematically-categorized catalogue of quotations from the early Church. I think it deserves a place on your bookshelf alongside another more “standard” systematic theology like Erickson or van der Kooi and van den Brink. However, at just over 900 pages, it’s too long to work well as a main text for this course.\nVan der Kooi \u0026amp; van den Brink, Christian Dogmatics This is another resource that isn’t a classic yet, at least not in the USA, because it’s only been available in English translation since 2017. However, it’s already a classic work in Dutch since it came out in the Netherlands in 2012. Just like Erickson and Grudem above, this is a pedagogically useful and comprehensive systematic theology. However, just like Erickson and Grudem, at 800 pages, this book is also too long to serve as our main text.\nFurthermore, while Erickson and Grudem approach things from a particularly Baptist perspective, van der Kooi and van den Brink approach things from a particularly Dutch Reformed perspective. Nothing against these perspectives, of course, but (1) I don’t hold them and (2) I think McGrath (as well as Felker Jones, Oden, and others) does a better job of exposing us to as broad/mainstream an exposition of Christian theology as possible.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/introduction-to-christian-theology-a-draft-syllabus/","summary":"As a part of my \u0026ldquo;pedagogical experience\u0026rdquo; at Wheaton College this semester, I was required to draft a syllabus for an introduction to Christian theology.

Thankfully, it appears to have been fixed (although it still has issues). This means I can search Barth\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Collected Edition\u0026rdquo; (Gesamtausgabe) if needed.\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;m now having some issues with the copy of Barth\u0026rsquo;s Church Dogmatics I purchased via Logos Bible Software.\nBefore I complain, let me first say how grateful I am that Logos is MUCH more user-friendly than the Digital Karl Barth Library.\nAs an apparent example of this user-friendliness, my Logos copy of the Church Dogmatics (CD) displays what appear to be the original German (Kirchliche Dogmatik, KD) page numbers in search results by default.\nAt first, this struck me as very helpful.\nHowever:\nThese KD page numbers aren\u0026rsquo;t accurate! They\u0026rsquo;re only tied to section headings. So, for example, \u0026ldquo;KD I.2 p. 305\u0026rdquo; displays in Logos for the section that runs from KD 1.2, 304 to 324. Then, it skips ahead to display \u0026ldquo;KD I.2 p. 324\u0026rdquo; until page 356! There\u0026rsquo;s no way (that I know of) to change the default display in the search results so that the accurate English page numbers (CD I.2 p. 310) are displayed. Instead, you have to click on each search result to open it, and then click on the \u0026ldquo;KD\u0026rdquo; page number to display a drop-down menu that shows the correct English \u0026ldquo;CD\u0026rdquo; page number.

Amen.\nIntroduction It’s been a particularly difficult week here at Church of the Savior.\nSince the end of the sermon last week:\nWe’ve learned that Father Kevin’s been diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease. We’ve lost a founding and foundational member of this church, Marilyn Stewart. And, of course, there are many other things that we’re carrying as individuals and as a body.\nSo, this evening, it sure feels like we gather as “those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.” The shadow of a particular death, as we mourn the loss of our beloved sister, Marilyn.\nAnd so we gather tonight as those who need “the tender compassion of our God.” We need “the dawn from on high” to break upon us,” give us light, and “guide our feet into the way of peace.”\nWe need peace. We need light. We need comfort.\nAnd instead we are given John the Baptist.\nWild-eyed, crazy-haired, locust-eating John the Baptist. God’s fiery messenger, crying out in the wilderness: “Prepare ye the way of the Lord! Repent, you brood of vipers!”\nNothing against John, of course. But, from our perspective at least, isn’t this unfortunate liturgical timing?\nI mean, come on, John. We’re struggling here.\nCan’t you come back another time? Maybe during Lent?\nRight now, we need some good news. We need some comfort.\nDo we really need to hear from John the Baptist right now?\nBig Idea I think we do, and here’s why.\nAs we wait for the Lord’s return, we must also, like John the Baptist, prepare the way of the Lord in the wilderness. In darkness and the shadow of death.\nAnd John reminds us that preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is not comfortable. But it is comforting.\nPreparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is not comfortable. It is not characterized by comfort.\nBut preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness is comforting, because it brings God’s comfort.\nFirst, what does it mean to “prepare the way of the Lord”? Well, it simply means to get things ready for God’s arrival.\nBut it specifically means to get a PEOPLE ready for God’s arrival.\nWe’re not talking about a literal road here that needs to be leveled and straightened and paved.\nWe’re talking about a group of people who need to get prepared for their God to arrive.\nThat’s what John the Baptist is up to. He’s getting people from the house of Israel ready to receive their Lord’s arrival as good news of deliverance, instead of as bad news of judgment.\nThe angel Gabriel said as much to John’s father, Zechariah, in Luke 1:16-17:\nAnd [John] will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God. He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and he will cause those who are rebellious to accept the wisdom of the godly.\nAnd when Zechariah himself prophesied about John’s ministry, in Luke 1:76-77, he said:\nAnd you, my little son, will be called the prophet of the Most High, because you will prepare the way for the Lord.\nHow?\nYou will tell his people how to find salvation through forgiveness of their sins.\nSo, preparing the way of the Lord means getting people ready for God to arrive.\nJohn prepared the way for our Lord Jesus Christ’s first arrival.\nWe Christians prepare the way for Lord’s second arrival, when he returns to “judge the living and the dead,” on the one hand, and to “wipe away every tear from [our] eyes” (Rev. 7:17), on the other.\nWhy, then, is getting people ready for Christ’s return not comfortable? 1. Because it’s done in the wilderness of human history. We prepare the way of the Lord in the midst of a world that, though it still belongs to God, has been infected and affected by sin and death at every level.\nBut when faced with such a world, the good news of Jesus Christ is not escapist. It’s not some pie-in-the-sky pipe dream that touches lightly on the carnage of human history. No!\nInstead, the good news of Jesus Christ doubles-down on space and time, on the here and now, on flesh and blood.\nDid you notice all those names at the beginning of our Gospel lesson? It started:\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar…\nAnd if all Luke wanted to do was to indicate the date, he could have stopped right there. But instead, he continues to list:\nPontius Pilate Herod Philip Lysanias Annas Caiaphas Very real, very powerful men. Men with the very real blood of the people of God–of the Son of God!–on their hands.\nAnd where does the word of God show up? To John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.\nYou see, the word of God offers us no escape from human history. It instead offers us a redemption of human history.\nThis redemption, as it turns out, includes some reversals of fortunes.\nAs Mary sang in Luke 1:52-53, when God redeems, he brings down rulers—like those 7 powerful men we just mentioned—from their thrones. But he lifts up the humble.\nWhen God redeems, he fills the hungry with good things, but he sends the rich away empty.\nAs our Gospel lesson put it, quoting Isaiah 40:3-5, when God redeems, valleys are raised up, mountains are brought down, crooked roads are made straight, and rough roads are made smooth.\nYes! Amen! That sounds like good news! Especially when we’re humbled and hungry in the valley of the shadow of death!\nI say we get some bulldozers and start chipping away at those mountains.\nI say we knock some cracks into the foundations of the halls of power.\nI say we let the Tiberiuses of this world know that their days in power are numbered.\nBut here there is a second reason why preparing the way of the Lord is uncomfortable.\n2. Because it begins with us, the people of God. John doesn’t go to Tiberius’ palace. He doesn’t pay a visit to Pontius Pilate’s mansion.\nHe does speak truth to Herod’s power, which gets him thrown into prison…\nBut the summary of John’s ministry that we get in Luke 3:3 is that John tells ordinary Israelites that they need to repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of their sins.\nWait a second, John. I thought this was about reversal.\nWe’ve been brought low, by Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, and now Rome. Surely we don’t need to repent. We’re the victims here! Go tell the Romans and those Roman-loving sellouts to repent.\nBut, of course, God’s redemption involves both reversal and renewal.\nThe good news of Jesus Christ is radical in that it calls both strong and the weak, both the oppressors and the oppressed to repent.\nTo turn away from sin and toward God. To embrace God’s agenda by living a transformed life. You see, God doesn’t need our bulldozers. He wants our repentance and our obedience.\nAs our collect reminds us this week, if the return of Jesus is to be received as good news, it must be preceded by repentance. Otherwise, the return of the Judge is bad news for the unrepentant.\nThis reminds me of Jesus’ words in Luke 18:7-8\nAnd will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\nWhen Jesus returns, will he find faith on the earth?\nGetting people ready for Christ’s return in the wilderness is not comfortable, because we have to ask ourselves that question before we ask it of anyone else.\nAnd yet, I insist, preparing the way of the Lord is comforting!\nWhy is getting ourselves ready for Christ’s return comforting? I find it fascinating that all four Gospels link the fiery ministry of John the Baptist with Isaiah 40.\nIsaiah 40 is a major turning point in the book of Isaiah. Very broadly speaking, chapters 1-39 mostly contain oracles of God’s judgment.\nAnd then we get to Isaiah 40, which begins:\nComfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.\nThe “voice crying in the wilderness,” which all four Gospels say is John the Baptist, is preparing the way—getting people ready–for the arrival of God’s comfort in and through Jesus Christ.\n1. Preparing the way of the Lord brings comfort, first, because, though we have sinned and need to repent, forgiveness is freely available through Jesus Christ. We are not saved by how well we repent. If we were, that would be very bad news. Instead, we are saved by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nTurning away from sin and toward Jesus in repentance and faith might not be comfortable, but it’s comforting because he’s more worthy of our faith than we are!\nWe don’t have to run the rat race of trying to earn God’s favor and give our own lives meaning. Instead, we can cling to Jesus and find forgiveness, purpose, and value in him.\n2. Preparing the way of the Lord brings comfort, second, because the wilderness will not have the final word. The word of God in the wilderness is NOT “get used to it! This is the way things are always going to be!” NO!\nI don’t care how common they are, even in the church. Sin, death, and disease are not the way things are supposed to be.\nGod will not let them stand forever. He is at work against them even now, and one day he will return to to abolish them forever.\nSo, getting ourselves ready for Christ’s return is comforting, even when done through tears, because the people thus prepared are those who await the fulfillment of Revelation 7:16-17:\n‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them,’ nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’ ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’”\nNo more decay. No more disease. No more death.\nThat’s what we’re preparing for. And that’s why it’s comforting.\nHow should we prepare the way of the Lord today, at Savior? How should we get ourselves ready for Christ’s return?\nWell, Father Kevin is going to preach more about repentance based on the content of John the Baptist’s preaching next week.\nBut, in the meantime, I’ve got three pastoral suggestions based on this week’s introduction of John’s ministry.\n1. Avoid escapism. Tell the truth about the wilderness. Maybe I’m just speaking to myself here, but it seems like one of the easiest approaches to the suffering we’re enduring here at Savior would be to ignore it. Put a smile on.\nHow are you doing? Fine. You? Fine. Everybody’s “fine.”\nNope. That’s not how the church is supposed to behave in the wilderness.\nInstead, let’s be honest with God and with each other about the wilderness in which we find ourselves.\nHow are you doing? Honestly. How are you really doing?\nMaybe instead of saying “fine,” you should tell the truth.\nI’m lonely. I’m afraid. I’m overwhelmed. I’m angry. I don’t understand why God is allowing this to happen. Friends, if the gospel tells us anything, it tells us that things right now are not the way they’re supposed to be.\nAnd, if we can’t be honest about that here, in the church, what hope do we have?\nYes, we should be grateful. Yes, we should be hopeful.\nBut we also need to be unflinchingly truthful. Especially in difficult seasons like the one we’re in right now.\n2. Radically resist busyness and hurry. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s one of our stated values here at Savior. It’s baked into the culture of this church.\nBut I bring it up again because of the temptation that I mentioned earlier to grab a bulldozer and try to level the mountains on our own.\nI’m not saying that the gospel shouldn’t lead us to oppose the effects of sin and death in the world around us. It should!\nBut we can’t allow mere activism to replace the uncomfortable work of examination and repentance.\nWhen the going gets tough, it’s often easier to lose ourselves in our work—perhaps especially when it’s “kingdom work”!—than it is to stop and tell the truth about how we’re doing.\nConfession and repentance are both more difficult and less comfortable than volunteering, giving, and even preaching.\nSo, let’s not use getting lost in the “Lord’s work” as an excuse for avoiding the Lord’s word.\n3. Lead the way in repentance by preaching the gospel to ourselves daily. It might not be comfortable, but God’s comforting word to us in the wilderness is that we are sinners and we need to repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of our sins.\nWe need to turn away from sin and toward our forgiving and comforting God.\nWe need to be united through baptism into Christ’s death, that we might experience the new life of his resurrection.\nAnd, here’s the thing, we never outgrow our baptism. But we often need to return to it.\nWe never outgrow our need to hear the gospel, repent, and cling to Jesus. But we often need to be reminded of it.\nSo let’s remind ourselves. Let’s remind each other.\nConclusion Like I said earlier, right now, this week, at Church of the Savior in Wheaton, IL, we need some good news.\nWe need some comfort.\nWe need to hear from John the Baptist, because he points us to Jesus.\nAnd the good news of Jesus Christ might be uncomfortable, but it’s the only source of true comfort in the wilderness, in the darkness, and in the shadow of death.\nSo, like John the Baptist, let’s prepare the way of the Lord.\nLet’s get a people ready for Christ’s return by getting ourselves ready, every day, to repent and cling to Jesus for forgiveness and comfort we so desperately need.\nAmen.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the video of the service. I start at about 41:30.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/preparing-the-way-of-the-lord-in-the-wilderness-luke-31-6/","summary":"I’d like to pray this week’s collect again:\nMerciful God, who sent your messengers the prophets to preach repentance and prepare the way for our salvation: Give us grace to heed their warnings and forsake our sins, that we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.

I\u0026rsquo;m now having a very difficult time searching for biblical citations in the database, whereas this used to be very straightforward.\nAccording to the current help page (which appears to be obsolete since the search software change):\n3.2.2 Biblical Citation\nDescription: This field enables the user to locate all instances where Barth refers to a book, chapter, or verse of the Bible. Since citations in the source edition may be formatted in a variety of ways (consider “Genesis 3,” “Gen. III,” and “the third chapter of the first book of Moses”), we have inserted uniform tags around each citation. From the user’s standpoint, this value-added tagging effectively eliminates the variations in spelling and format, and allows one to return a comprehensive and accurate set of results for any biblical citation.\nHow to use this field: Use this field to search for citations of a book, chapter, or verse of the Bible.\nPractical Example: Show all instances where Barth cites Romans 8:28.\nGo to the Biblical Citation field on the Advanced Search page. Select \u0026ldquo;Romans\u0026rdquo; from the drop-down list in the Book box. Enter the number “8” into the Chapter box. Enter the number “28” into the Verse box. Click on the Search button. The system responds with a list of all instances where Barth cites Romans 8:28. However, there is no longer a \u0026ldquo;Biblical Citation\u0026rdquo; search field. Instead, there is a main search terms box with expandable \u0026ldquo;Search Options.\u0026rdquo;\nPromisingly, these \u0026ldquo;Search Options\u0026rdquo; include fields for \u0026ldquo;Book,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Book2,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;From Chapter,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;To Chapter,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;From Verse,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;To Verse.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd yet, using \u0026ldquo;Exodus 32\u0026rdquo; as an example (which I know occurs as \u0026ldquo;Ex. 32\u0026rdquo; on page 328 of Church Dogmatics III/1), I can\u0026rsquo;t get the search results to produce anything!\nAt least the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works and Werke have thorough Scripture indexes for the entire series.

Amen.\nWell, friends, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotta say that, although it\u0026rsquo;s a pleasure to be here with you this morning, it honestly freaks me out a little bit to preach at a church I\u0026rsquo;ve never been to before, when the New Testament reading begins:\n\u0026ldquo;Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. For all of us make many mistakes.\u0026rdquo;!\nThe insecure perfectionist in me wants to shut up and sit down before I say something wrong! Maybe we should just read the rest of the book of James and call it a day.\nBut, of course, James\u0026rsquo; warning makes sense. Christian teachers ought to be judged with greater strictness, because, to put it simply, words matter—especially when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about who God is, what God has done, and what it means to live as God\u0026rsquo;s people.\nAlthough headlines these days might lead us to believe that you can say absolutely anything—no matter how ridiculous or offensive—without suffering lasting consequences, James reminds us that God cares about what you say! Even what you say online, I might add!\nOf course, this is somewhat unfortunate because, as James also reminds us, it is so much easier to talk your way into trouble than out of it!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very easy to say the self-serving thing, the dishonest thing, the inflammatory thing.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s much more difficult to say the true thing, the loving thing, the wise thing.\nWhy?\nBecause, as James reminds us,\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness.\nThe tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.\u0026rdquo;\nThough the tongue is a relatively small part of the human body, just like bits in a horse\u0026rsquo;s mouth or the rudder of a ship, it can produce some some pretty big changes.\nWhat we say and how we say it can completely change the course of our lives and the lives of others around us. And a careless word spoken to a parent, a spouse, a child, or a friend can ruin lives.\nAnd, here\u0026rsquo;s the kicker:\n\u0026ldquo;With [the tongue] we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.\nFrom the same mouth come blessing and cursing.\nMy brothers, these things ought not to be so.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but that last part makes me even more nervous.\nGod doesn\u0026rsquo;t just care what we say to or about him. God also cares about what we say to or about other people, his image-bearers!\nAnd, if I\u0026rsquo;m honest, this puts me to shame when I think about how much more time and effort I put into choosing my words carefully in a sermon, compared to how careless I often am when speaking to people who were created in the image of God.\nSure, I still make mistakes in the sermons! But at least I try to think through a sermon.\nYet, I\u0026rsquo;ll often lash-out at someone without a second thought!\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;ve ever preached before or not, I trust you\u0026rsquo;ve been there, too.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve all said some things we later regretted. We\u0026rsquo;ve all learned that it\u0026rsquo;s easier to talk yourself into trouble than out of it.\nMain Point My main point this morning is, I think, rather simple to understand. But it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to live.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s this: The only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.\nThe only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.\nOur passage from James has already reminded us that taming the tongue—being wise and controlled in how you communicate—is incredibly difficult.\nAnd James has convicted us that, even though it\u0026rsquo;s difficult, there\u0026rsquo;s no excuse for using our tongues to praise God one moment and then to trash the people God has made the next.\nThis leaves us in a bit of a bind! At least we\u0026rsquo;re not alone.\nMark 8:27-38 Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at our Gospel text in Mark 8.\nWhen Jesus asks his disciples in Mark chapter 8 verse 29 \u0026ldquo;who do you say that I am?,\u0026rdquo; Peter hits a home run and says, straight-up, \u0026ldquo;You are the Christ.\u0026rdquo;\nThat is, \u0026ldquo;you are the Messiah.\u0026rdquo;\nThat is, \u0026ldquo;you are God\u0026rsquo;s promised deliverer of his people, you are the savior-king that we\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd, look at that! Here\u0026rsquo;s a bit of good news: by the grace of God, human speech can be accurate! It can even be used to accomplish God\u0026rsquo;s will in the world (just read Peter\u0026rsquo;s later letters).\nBut, of course, things quickly go downhil for Peter. In Mark\u0026rsquo;s telling of the story, the next thing Peter does is talk himself into trouble. He takes Jesus aside and rebukes him for Jesus\u0026rsquo; clear teaching about his upcoming suffering, death, and resurrection.\nNow, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the exact same as \u0026ldquo;cursing\u0026rdquo; Jesus. It was probably more of a reprimand, like: \u0026ldquo;Jesus, what are you talking about? If you\u0026rsquo;re the Messiah, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to suffer and die. You\u0026rsquo;re going to conquer! And we\u0026rsquo;re going to conquer with you!\u0026rdquo;\nStill, even by the disciples\u0026rsquo; standards in the Gospels, rebuking Jesus is pretty bad. Peter earns himself the stunning rebuke from Jesus in verse 33:\n“Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”\nSpeaking to the crowd and his disciples, in verse 34 and 35, Jesus then says:\n“If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.\nFor whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel\u0026rsquo;s will save it.\nIn other words, \u0026ldquo;no pain, no gain!\u0026rdquo;\nPeter was wrong. The Messiah will be victorious, even over death itself! But he would suffer first.\nIf we want to experience the joy and the glory of Jesus\u0026rsquo; resurrection, there\u0026rsquo;s no other way to get there than to take up our cross and follow him through his cross.\nWhat does it mean to take up your cross and follow Jesus?\nIt means that following Jesus requires a painful death. Sometimes, a literal death of martyrdom!\nBut first and foremost following Jesus requires a death to ourselves and our selfish desires. To take up your cross is to deny yourself.\nNow, of course, there are many different ways to take up your cross and follow Jesus in every single area of your life.\nThis morning, I\u0026rsquo;d like to focus on what this looks like when it comes to communication.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;d like to suggest that the only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.\nThe only way to be wise and controlled in how you communicate is to die to yourself for Jesus\u0026rsquo; sake and for the gospel\u0026rsquo;s sake.\nSo, we must deny ourselves in order to tame our tongues when we speak to God and to God\u0026rsquo;s image-bearers.\nThis is because self-interest is at the root of all foolish and undisciplined speech!\nThink about it, every stupid thing we\u0026rsquo;ve ever said can be traced back to our desires to get ahead!\nSelf-restraint and trying harder are not enough.\nOnly the self-denial that follows Jesus to the cross will allow Jesus to set us free from our selfish desires.\nThe good news is that, although the human tongue is, to use the technical theological term, jacked-up by sin, it is not beyond being saved and used by God.\nRescued by Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit, we can be set free to glorify God the Father by loving God and loving others, especially in how we communicate.\nThe only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.\nWhat does that look like, though? Admittedly, the passage we read from James today doesn\u0026rsquo;t give us much to go on as far as how to apply these things to our lives today.\nInstead, the main point of James 3:1-12 is that, although it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly difficult to control what you say, it still makes absolutely no sense to bless God and curse the human beings God has made.\nThe implied point of the passage is that we should not do that. Instead, we should both bless God and bless God\u0026rsquo;s image-bearers.\nThat is, in addition to praising God for who he is and what he has done, we should communicate with others for their good and well-being, instead of for our own selfish interests.\nHow do we do that?\nWell, let me offer some suggestions from the book of James as a whole.\nFirst, as our passage implies, we need to realize that, whenever we are communicating with another person, we are either talking to God or to one of God\u0026rsquo;s image-bearers. Though it might seem mundane and unimportant, our daily communication with God\u0026rsquo;s image-bearers is a huge area of our life in which we either obey or disobey Jesus\u0026rsquo; command to deny ourselves, take up our crosses, and follow him.\nWith our speech, we\u0026rsquo;re always either building people up in selfless love or tearing them down in selfish pride. (Or, on our good days, we\u0026rsquo;re manipulating them with flattery.)\nWe need to take a similar kind of care when we\u0026rsquo;re talking to God and to God\u0026rsquo;s image-bearers.\nAs James seems to focus on later in chapter 4, this should start within the church, by refusing to speak evil of our brothers and sisters in Christ.\nBut then, of course, this should overflow outside the church, by communicating with every human being we encounter for their benefit.\nNow, as Jesus himself modeled for us, this \u0026ldquo;speaking the truth in love\u0026rdquo; will sometimes involve speaking uncomfortable truths. But there is a difference between doing this for others\u0026rsquo; benefit—even if it makes them unhappy—and doing so for your own benefit.\nTelling the difference between speaking hard truths in love and speaking them in self-interest requires wisdom.\nSecond, we need to pray. As James 1:5 puts it:\n\u0026ldquo;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.\u0026rdquo;\nGiven how difficult it is to tame our tongues, we should regularly ask God for the wisdom and the ability to communicate in a way that blesses him and his image-bearers.\nIt could be as simple as praying the last verse of Psalm 19 each morning before leaving the house (or leaving your bed):\n\u0026ldquo;Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.\u0026rdquo;\nThird, we need to slow down and calm down in our communication. Consider James 1:19-20:\n\u0026ldquo;Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.\u0026rdquo;\nWe should tape those verses to every screen in our lives.\nWe need to realize that the 24-hour news cycle, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are all conditioning us to disobey God.\nThey are training us to be slow to listen, or to only listen to those with extreme positions that we agree with.\nThey are training us to be quick to speak.\nAnd they are certainly training us to be quick to anger.\nWhat in our lives is training us in the other direction? Toward wisdom? Toward the righteousness of God?\nHow much time do we spend being pulled in either direction?\nPerhaps we need to pray for the wisdom and the ability to turn off the TV and log off Facebook and Twitter.\nFinally, we need to back up our words with our actions. Taming the tongue doesn\u0026rsquo;t just mean not saying anything bad. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t just mean saying good things. It also includes speaking in a way that is consistent with your behavior.\nJames 1:22 tells us to \u0026ldquo;be doers of the word, and not hearers only.\u0026rdquo;\nJames 1:26-27 sees right through our pretensions and says:\nIf anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person\u0026rsquo;s religion is worthless.\nReligion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.\nAs James 2:14-17 puts it:\nWhat good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?\nIf a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?\nSaying the words \u0026ldquo;go in peace, be warmed and filled\u0026rdquo; to a poor hungry person is not wrong.\nDoing so without doing the works of warming and filling them is.\nTrue faith in Jesus Christ shows itself in both words and works.\nThe only way to tame your tongue is to take up your cross and follow Jesus.\nSo, Father, we ask that you would send your Holy Spirit to give us the wisdom and the ability to bless you and your image-bearers in how we communicate. Redeemed by his blood, may we display your Son\u0026rsquo;s self-sacrificial love in what we say and how we live. Amen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/take-up-your-tongue-and-follow-jesus/","summary":"This sermon, on Mark 8:27-38 and James 3:1-12, was originally preached on September 16, 2018 at Christ Redeemer Anglican Church in Milwaukee, WI.\nIntroduction Would you pray with me?\nO God, because without you we are not able to please you—especially in what we say!—mercifully grant that your Holy Spirit may in all things direct and rule our hearts, so that the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts might be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, our strength and our redeemer.","title":"Take Up Your Tongue and Follow Jesus"},{"content":"SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGIES: A LIST I put together the following list, using the 10th edition of John Glynn\u0026rsquo;s Commentary and Reference Survey (Kegel, 2007) as a starting point.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be updating this list in the future, but I could use your help.

The main thing I had scheduled that day was a get-together with my doctoral supervisor and his other students to discuss part two of our reading of Friedrich Schleiermacher\u0026rsquo;s Christian Faith.\nAs per usual, before diving into our book discussion, we went around the table and gave life updates. The gist of mine was:\nWell, we had a bit of a \u0026ldquo;scare\u0026rdquo; last week, because Rachel\u0026rsquo;s blood pressure was slightly elevated at her midwife appointment. So, they sent us over to get an NST (fetal non-stress test), more blood pressure measurements, and an ultrasound to measure the baby. Thankfully, everything looked fine. We\u0026rsquo;re pretty sure her high blood pressure is due to \u0026ldquo;white coat hypertension,\u0026rdquo; because her BP always looks fine at home and at work.\nSo, we\u0026rsquo;ve got another midwife appointment this afternoon, but we should be all set to drive out to Pennsylvania tomorrow for the wedding this weekend.\n~Me.\nYou see, on Saturday, July 21, Rachel\u0026rsquo;s sister, Hannah, was getting married. Rachel was the Matron of Honor, and I was the officiant for the wedding.\nOr at least, that\u0026rsquo;s what we were planning on.\nThe Midwife Appointment (4:00 pm, Tuesday) I met Rachel at Elmhurst Hospital for our midwife appointment on Tuesday afternoon.\nJust like the previous week, her initial blood pressure was high. So, they sent us over to triage on the Labor and Delivery unit for another NST.\n\u0026ldquo;No big deal,\u0026rdquo; we thought. \u0026ldquo;Things will come back normal again, and we\u0026rsquo;ll be on our way to Pennsylvania tomorrow.\u0026rdquo;\nIn fact, while Rachel headed over to triage, I went out to pick us up some food for dinner.\nTriage, Elmhurst Hospital, Labor and Delivery Unit (˜5:00pm, Tuesday) When I got over to the triage room, Mediterranean pita wraps in tow, Rachel was already hooked up to the monitors.\nUnfortunately, more than two of her BPs were higher than 140/90. To us, this didn\u0026rsquo;t seem like that big of a deal. Surely it was just a combination of nerves and stress!\nHowever, Rachel met the diagnostic criteria for gestational hypertension. And, as a midwife explained to us in the triage room, the treatment for gestational hypertension these days is to induce labor starting at 37 weeks gestation.\nWhich, for us, meant getting induced in about 7 hours, shortly after midnight. The only other alternative was to leave AMA: \u0026ldquo;Against Medical Advice.\u0026rdquo;\nTo put it lightly, this was difficult news to receive. We went from thinking that we were going to be on our way the next day to Pennsylvania for the wedding to realizing that we were going to be in the hospital until we came home with a baby!\nSo, first, there was the disappointment/stress of missing the wedding. Then, there were the other questions: Were we ready for the baby to arrive? (The nursery wasn\u0026rsquo;t due to be finished until around August 8, the due date.) Was Rachel\u0026rsquo;s body ready to deliver at 37 weeks? Was this labor and delivery more likely to end in a C-section? Would the baby be OK, or would she face health complications from being born too early?\nThe midwife reassured us that the baby was not going to be significantly more likely to have health complications from being delivered at 37 weeks vs. waiting to 38 or 39 weeks to induce labor.\nOn my end, it was helpful to hear that the reason gestational hypertension is a concern, even though it\u0026rsquo;s not as serious as pre-eclampsia, is that the mother\u0026rsquo;s blood pressure can very quickly and unexpectedly get out of control late in the pregnancy. There\u0026rsquo;s no way of telling on the front end, however, which mothers/babies will be fine all the way through and which will die unexpectedly. So, inducing labor at 37 weeks across the board for gestational hypertension has been determined to be the safest course of action.\nSo, while it was going to be a bummer to miss the wedding, I reassured myself/Rachel that, at least, we would get to meet our baby girl soon! Plus, even if we had been able to sweet-talk our way into a deal where they let us go home and come back for blood pressure checks each day, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure that \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; would be worth the extra stress.\nAdmitted to Elmhurst Hospital, Labor and Delivery Unit (˜7:00pm, Tuesday) So, we literally walked right across the hallway from triage to our pre-partum hospital room on the Labor and Delivery unit.\nAfter getting settled, we began the process of letting friends and family know what was happening.\nI let my doctoral supervisor and fellow students know that I had spoken too soon that afternoon, and that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be making the trip out to Pennsylvania.\nI also let our landlord know that we would be needing that baby room finished sooner than initially expected!\nAnd, as I headed back home to grab supplies for our stay at the hospital, I called my parents to let them know that their granddaughter would be arriving sooner than expected.\nBack at the apartment by myself, calling Rachel to double-check what she needed in her \u0026ldquo;go-bag,\u0026rdquo; it was a bit surreal to realize that, most likely, the next time I would come home we would have our daughter with us!\nI somewhat frantically tidied-up the apartment (\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want our baby to come home to a messy house!\u0026rdquo;) and packed our bags before heading back to the hospital.\nINDUCTION STARTS: Cervidil (˜12:30 am – 12:30 pm, Wednesday) The induction process started around 12:30 am with the insertion of a medicine called Cervidil to soften the cervix.\nDespite our hopes that things would start to progress rather quickly, Wednesday was a looooooong day. Looking back, I can tell that this was the case because I had time to tweet.\nhttps://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019570011952861184\nAlso, I figured that now was as good a time as any to ask for some last-minute parenting advice.\nhttps://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019606474115420160\nBy the way, my friend Ryan Clevenger wins the award for best dad advice given in response to my tweet.\nhttps://twitter.com/Nazianzenus/status/1019641823030112261\nAnyways, the first round of Cervidil lasted 12 hours. After they took the Cervidil out, they checked and Rachel was barely dilated.\nNevertheless, they decided to try to insert what is called the Cook Cervical Ripening Balloon, AKA the Cook catheter.\nCook Cervical Ripening Balloon, Unsuccessful Attempt #1 (1:30 pm, Wednesday) Here\u0026rsquo;s a picture of what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\nThey insert that thing through the cervix, before inflating those balloons on both sides of the cervix.\nOr, at least, that\u0026rsquo;s how it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to go.\nUnfortunately, they weren\u0026rsquo;t able to get this thing in on Wednesday afternoon. According to Rachel, it was extremely painful. It was difficult to watch her go through it.\nSo, after giving her a bit of break, the midwife recommended starting Pitocin.\nStarted Pitocin (4:00pm, Wednesday) After the unsuccessful insertion of the Cook catheter, they decided to monitor Rachel to see if any regular contractions started. No dice.\nAfter talking with our doula, Teri, on the phone, we decided to start Pitocin on Wednesday afternoon. If you\u0026rsquo;re curious, here\u0026rsquo;s some more information about Pitocin and what it does.\nSo, they started Pitocin at around 4:00pm on Wednesday. Just like Cervidil, the first round lasted approximately 12 hours.\nhttps://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019780168326565889\nTo Eat, or Not to Eat Apparently, normal hospital protocol is that you\u0026rsquo;re only allowed to consume clear liquids while on Pitocin. We\u0026rsquo;d heard from various people that this was a load of crap. However, the midwife who was there when we started Pitocin still said \u0026ldquo;clear liquids only.\u0026rdquo;\nNevertheless, we still snuck Rachel snacks when nurses weren\u0026rsquo;t in the room!\nOn Wednesday evening, we met with a different midwife to discuss how things were progressing. She said \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re eating, right?,\u0026rdquo; and then we told her about our clear liquid instructions.\n\u0026ldquo;No no no, you (looks at me) go get her some dinner, OK?\u0026rdquo;\nBest. midwife. ever. I went and got Rachel some Pad Thai.\nWe also discussed with the midwife what would happen if things didn\u0026rsquo;t progress at all over night. She said that, if NOTHING had changed in the morning, that they would consider another consult with maternal and fetal medicine doctors to see if we could be sent home for 24 hours before returning to re-start the induction process.\nHowever, she said, if things had moved along enough to allow for the insertion of the Cook catheter, then we would proceed until the baby arrived.\nOff Pitocin (5:30 am, Thursday) At around 5:30 am, Rachel came off her first round of Pitocin. They checked, and she was only dilated to 1cm. This was kind of a bummer. 29 hours after induction began, with only a measly centimeter to show for it!\nNevertheless, this was still progress. So, the next thing we decided to try was the insertion of the Cook catheter again.\nBefore doing so, Rachel got another break, during which she drank some coffee, ate breakfast, took a shower, etc. Honestly, she seemed pretty chipper at this point. Which was good, because things were about to get going!\nLABOR STARTS: Cook Catheter, Successful Attempt #2 (8:30 am, Thursday) Thankfully, the second time was a charm. They were able to successfully insert the Cook catheter on Thursday morning at 8:30. (Although, it took another three tries. According to Rachel, the first two were quite painful but the third, when it was successfully in place, didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that bad.)\nAfter this, however, Rachel started feeling worse/bad and contractions started to pick up. From my perspective, the difference between Rachel at 8:00am and Rachel at 10:00am was enormous.\nLooking back, we\u0026rsquo;d say that labor started around this time.\nUnfortunately, what also started around this time was vomiting (Rachel, not me). I wrote down the first times: 0912, 0945, 1050, 1121, 1215, 1430, 1605\u0026hellip; Then, in my notebook, I just have \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; (more times).\u0026rdquo; It was rough.\nBack on Pitocin (10:30 am, Thursday) Things were progressing, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly take off after the Cook catheter was in. So, it was back on Pitocin.\nhttps://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1019982256037859329\nRachel\u0026rsquo;s contractions were getting more and more painful. Specifically, she was complaining about pain/tension in her lower back.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, she was getting to the point where she had to stop talking during contractions. This despite her insistence that, while she could talk through the contractions if she really wanted to, it was easier not to talk\u0026hellip;\nBetween that and the vomiting, I suggested that we give our doula a call and ask her to come in.\nDoula Teri Arrives (1:00 pm, Thursday) Teri, our doula, arrived at about 1:00 pm on Thursday. Rachel wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing so hot by then, and I was very glad to have someone else there for more support.\nThe way things were going, with the back pain and the vomiting, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how much longer we\u0026rsquo;d be able to handle things on our own without someone a bit more knowledgeable there to support us.\nTurning Babies, Stressful Nurses (Thursday Afternoon) Thanks be to God that Teri came when she did!\nWith some coordinated hip movements, she was able to turn the baby around and relieve Rachel\u0026rsquo;s back pain! Rachel said that it was the weirdest thing ever feeling the baby turn around, and it brought pretty much instant relief.\nSo, even though her contractions kept getting more intense, they were easier to bear without the pain being concentrated in her lower back.\nNevertheless, Thursday afternoon wasn\u0026rsquo;t all rainbows and butterflies.\nFor one thing, despite the relief in back pain, contractions were still picking up. At one point, they were about 2.5 minutes apart and pretty intense.\nHowever, we got a new nurse at this point, and she really just stressed us out. She meant well, to be sure, but her ways of handling things were quite different than any of the other nurses we had throughout the process.\nWhenever she would come into the room, which she did rather frequently, Rachel\u0026rsquo;s contractions would slow down or get erratic. This made the nurse (and the midwife) want to crank up the Pitocin. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the greatest afternoon.\nHowever, that nurse eventually left. Also, Rachel was able to get a decent nap in\u0026hellip; THROUGH some pretty intense contractions! (Teri and I were pretty surprised, looking at the monitor, watching the contractions come, without a peep or change in facial expression from Rachel as she slept.)\nRemoved Cook Catheter (8:00pm, Thursday) https://twitter.com/joshuapsteele/status/1020115308634361857\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something about 12 hour rounds of things during induction/labor. So, at 8:00pm or so, they took out the Cook catheter.\nAfter a pretty intense afternoon, Rachel was dilated to (*drumroll*) \u0026hellip; 3cm!\n43.5 hours for 3 centimeters. Sure, progress. But SLOW!\nThe midwife recommended breaking the bag of waters to move things along. After being reassured that this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t put us \u0026ldquo;on a clock\u0026rdquo; before they would intervene with a C-section, we decided to go ahead with that plan.\nBroke Bag of Waters, Transferred to Labor and Delivery Room (8:50 pm, Thursday) Let me tell you, I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how quickly they would get equipment ready and break the bag of waters!\nWe made the call to break the bag. I stepped into the restroom to pee, and by the time I got back out they were right in the middle of the procedure there on the bed!\nThankfully, after this, they moved us to an actual labor and delivery room down the hall. We hoped that things would start to pick up, which was the goal of breaking the bag of waters, after all\u0026hellip;\nSlow Down (9:00 pm, Thursday – 12:00 am, Friday) However, things slowed back down. This did allow Rachel to take a shower and sleep for another hour or so, but it was concerning that we appeared to be moving backward.\nAs Rachel slept for a while, Teri sat in the recliner in the corner and I laid down on the couch.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep at all. I was watching her contractions get slower and slower on the monitor and wondering how much longer this process was going to go on for. I mean, sure, Rachel is a BOSS. But everyone has their limits. How much longer of an induction/labor process would she be able to take?\nAfter she got some rest, we got Rachel up and moving around. Her and I took a couple laps around the Labor and Delivery unit.\nPick Back Up (12:00 – 2:30 am, Friday) Thankfully, the movement and changing positions got things going again.\nHonestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember too much about this period. I was purposefully just trying to stay awake and not pay too much attention to the clock.\nAt one point, however, after trying out various positions, we got Rachel into a good groove of contractions while she sat upright, cross-legged, in the bed—like some sort of pregnant zen master!\nAt 2:30am, they checked Rachel again. She was dilated to (*tired drumroll*) \u0026hellip; 5cm.\nMy heart kind of sank at this point, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t know whether to expect things to really get moving, or to expect that we would spend all day/night Friday in labor.\nThree Hours in Hell (2:30 – 5:30 am, Friday) Thankfully, things really started to move along.\nGranted, I say \u0026ldquo;thankfully,\u0026rdquo; but this was really the most intense three hours of the whole process.\nThe midwife who was on at that point was willing to allow Rachel to labor for awhile in the tub, which she was looking forward to.\nHowever, because Rachel was on Pitocin, she was on continuous fetal monitoring\u0026hellip; these two sensors they put around her stomach, to measure contractions and the baby\u0026rsquo;s heart rate.\nNow, I don\u0026rsquo;t doubt that these monitors can prove incredibly helpful. But they can also be really freaking annoying. It is so easy to lose the baby\u0026rsquo;s heart rate whenever the mom moves. Then a nurse has to come back in and readjust the monitor until they find the heart rate again. But then mom or baby moves like two minutes later and the cycle begins again.\nSo, before they were going to let Rachel get in the tub, they wanted her to lie down on her back in the bed so that they could get a good 30 minutes of the baby\u0026rsquo;s heart rate on the monitor to make sure things were OK.\nRachel was not happy about this because lying on her back was the least comfortable position for her to be in. However, she endured, and made it to the tub.\nThe tub is where, eventually, Rachel got to \u0026ldquo;transition\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;transitional labor.\u0026rdquo; You can read more about it here. Suffice it to say that it\u0026rsquo;s usually the most intense part of labor.\nThings were a blur by this point: Tub. Toilet. Tub. Bed. Birthing Ball. Tub. Vomit/retching.\nAt one point, between the hunger, exhaustion, the deep breathing I was doing with Rachel during her contractions, and kneeling beside the tub holding the puke bucket as she vomited\u0026hellip;I began to get nauseous myself!\nI asked Teri to go grab me a ginger ale, and I snuck swigs of ginger all and bites of a Clif Bar between Rachel\u0026rsquo;s contractions in the tub.\nAgain, at this point, I was purposefully trying not to pay attention to the clock. Sure, things seemed to be moving along now. I\u0026rsquo;d read in the books that when the mom said \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t do this anymore,\u0026rdquo; that usually meant they were in transition, which meant they were about ready to push\u0026hellip;\nBut, at 2:30 am Rachel had only been at 5 centimeters. So, it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem wise to get my hopes up. And yet, here my wife was, throwing up over the side of the tub during contractions and saying she didn\u0026rsquo;t know how much longer she could do this for.\nSomewhere around 5:15–5:30, the midwife and her student came in and checked Rachel again, because she was complaining of increased pressure down low.\nAt this point, I was praying that she was at least 8cm dilated. If not, based on how intense things had just gotten, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how much longer Rachel would make it without, at the very least, some nitrous gas for pain management.\nHowever, thanks be to God, she was dilated to\u0026hellip;9.5cm!\n\u0026ldquo;BUT I HAVE TO PUSH!\u0026rdquo; (5:30–5:46 am, Friday) Now, if you\u0026rsquo;re in the know, you realize that 9.5cm doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite cut it. 10cm is the magic dilation number.\nSO, although I personally took the 9.5cm news as a comforting blessing and relief from the Lord, for Rachel things got more intense for a bit.\nAs it\u0026rsquo;s been described to me, every fiber of her being was urging her to push that baby out, but I and everyone else in the room were urging her NOT to push until she reached full (10cm) dilation.\nI was feeling: \u0026ldquo;YES! Thank God! We\u0026rsquo;re almost there! We don\u0026rsquo;t have to endure another full day of labor!!\u0026rdquo;\nThey turned the lights up in the room as more people entered to get things ready for delivery. Teri and I focused on keeping Rachel from pushing for as long as we could.\nEventually, the midwife went to check Rachel\u0026rsquo;s dilation again, and said: \u0026ldquo;Aaaand, the baby\u0026rsquo;s head is already through the cervix!\u0026rdquo;\nRachel: \u0026ldquo;DOES THAT MEAN I CAN PUSH?!\u0026rdquo;\nMidwife: \u0026ldquo;Yep! You can push!\u0026rdquo;\nRachel only ended up pushing for 10-15 minutes.\nNow, I usually don\u0026rsquo;t do well with blood, etc., but for some reason I was perfectly fine watching the whole thing as our daughter came out. It was wild. It took awhile to see her head coming, but then, boom!, she was all the way out and screaming!\nBABY ARRIVES: Eva Joy Steele was born at 5:46 am on Friday, July 20, 2018. She weighed 5lbs 8oz, she was 18 inches long, and she has been worth every minute of that lengthy labor and delivery!\nLooking back, apart from the initial frustration about getting induced at 37 weeks, we felt very well cared for by the midwives and nurses at Elmhurst. We didn\u0026rsquo;t feel pressured into moving things along quicker than we felt comfortable with, and we\u0026rsquo;re very thankful for the medical care that Rachel and Eva received.\nAlso, we\u0026rsquo;re incredibly grateful to our doula, Teri, for her support along the way. Even if the only thing she had done was to turn the baby around, that would have been enough! But she went above and beyond throughout the rest of the process, and we\u0026rsquo;re very thankful she was there with us.\nFor me, after going through this with my wife, I\u0026rsquo;m even more impressed by what a strong woman she is. I already knew that she had grit, but making through such a long process without any kind of pain medication was nothing short of amazing.\nWith Rachel and Eva, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve got a pretty great team.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/eva-joy-steele-a-birth-story/","summary":"This is a self-indulgently long story.

That’s the shadow side of theology, but the best part is speaking light and truth in astonished indications of God’s goodness. I love John Webster’s definition of theology: “that delightful activity in which the Church praises God by ordering its thinking towards the gospel of Christ.” Being a theologian means getting to have not necessarily the last word, but the word about last things, “the end for which God created the world” (to cite the title of a dissertation by Jonathan Edwards). It’s not only a good word but the best of all possible words, namely, that God glorifies humans and all creation, magnifying his own glory and subjecting all things to the Lordship of Christ, so that “God may be all in all” (1 Cor. 15:28). It’s the privilege of the theologian to bear witness to the length, depth, breadth, and width of the cross and Resurrection. Karl Barth is right: “The theologian who has no joy in his work is not a theologian at all.”\nAnyway, you should read Vanhoozer\u0026rsquo;s essay if:\nYou\u0026rsquo;re curious about theology You\u0026rsquo;re considering becoming/being a theologian You\u0026rsquo;ve wondered what the heck theologians do anyways.

What\u0026rsquo;s drawing them in?\nYou can read my full post over at the Telos Collective blog, but here\u0026rsquo;s a taste:\nAnglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).\nNo “culture of this world” can be equated with the culture of Jesus Christ. This is, I suggest, the important sense in which Christians (and not just Anglican ones) should not be “seeker-sensitive.”\nAnd yet, on the other hand, the very mission of the church seems to demand that Christians be “seeker-sensitive” in the best sense of the phrase. This is because the gospel, though it does contain a powerful critique of a world alienated from God, is only “good news” to the extent that it resonates with (and does not merely refute) the cultures in which it is proclaimed.\nSo, perhaps we Anglicans need to do a better job of being “seeker-sensitive”—in the sense of resonating with the culture(s).\n“Resonating” with the culture, however, does not necessarily mean “approving.” Instead, the church’s resonance with the cultures around it will frequently be “subversive” (again, see Scot McKnight’s previous piece).\nToward that end, I’d like to consider some ways in which I’ve noticed the Anglican tradition subversively resonating with the culture(s) around it—especially those in the United States of America in recent years.\nContinue reading over at the Telos Collective blog.\nThen, let me know whether you think I got it right or not!

Here's My Take"},{"content":"Previously, I catalogued a bunch of different takes on Jordan Peterson, before giving my own take.\nSince that post, two other pieces about Jordan Peterson have been written that I\u0026rsquo;d like to share.\n\u0026ldquo;Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy,\u0026rdquo; by Nellie Bowles (New York Times) Nellie Bowles writes\nMr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.\nLater in the piece, she continues:\n“He was angry at God because women were rejecting him,” Mr. Peterson says of the Toronto killer. “The cure for that is enforced monogamy. That’s actually why monogamy emerges.”\nMr. Peterson does not pause when he says this. Enforced monogamy is, to him, simply a rational solution. Otherwise women will all only go for the most high-status men, he explains, and that couldn’t make either gender happy in the end.\n“Half the men fail,” he says, meaning that they don’t procreate. “And no one cares about the men who fail.”\nI laugh, because it is absurd.\n“You’re laughing about them,” he says, giving me a disappointed look. “That’s because you’re female.”\nBut aside from interventions that would redistribute sex, Mr. Peterson is staunchly against what he calls “equality of outcomes,” or efforts to equalize society. He usually calls them pathological or evil.\nHe agrees that this is inconsistent. But preventing hordes of single men from violence, he believes, is necessary for the stability of society. Enforced monogamy helps neutralize that.\nOK, here is a perfect example of how easy it is to misunderstand Peterson. When he says \u0026ldquo;enforced monogamy,\u0026rdquo; he\u0026rsquo;s using a technical anthropological term, one that has to do with social norms, and not enforcing monogamy by assigning sexual partners through the use of state (or other) power/violence.\nPeterson himself has attempted to clarify this since the NYT piece, writing:\nSo, let’s summarize. Men get frustrated when they are not competitive in the sexual marketplace (note: the fact that they DO get frustrated does not mean that they SHOULD get frustrated. Pointing out the existence of something is not the same as justifying its existence). Frustrated men tend to become dangerous, particularly if they are young. The dangerousness of frustrated young men (even if that frustration stems from their own incompetence) has to be regulated socially. The manifold social conventions tilting most societies toward monogamy constitute such regulation.\nThat’s all.\nNo recommendation of police-state assignation of woman to man (or, for that matter, man to woman).\nNo arbitrary dealing out of damsels to incels.\nNothing scandalous (all innuendo and suggestive editing to the contrary)\nJust the plain, bare, common-sense facts: socially-enforced monogamous conventions decrease male violence. In addition (and not trivially) they also help provide mothers with comparatively reliable male partners, and increase the probability that stable, father-intact homes will exist for children.\nNow, of course, you can still disagree with Peterson\u0026rsquo;s take here. However, it seems unfair to make it sound like he thinks women should be assigned to men against their wishes.\n\u0026ldquo;The Shocking Truth About Jordan Peterson,\u0026rdquo; by Wesley Yang (Tablet) This piece by Wesley Yang is currently my favorite take on Jordan Peterson, because it offers such a nuanced critique.\nWesley Yang writes\nThere is something uneasily poised at the border of grandiosity and grandeur, heroism and quixotism, about Peterson that makes him appealing to undergraduates at the same time as it makes him a target-rich environment for haughty intellectuals and snarky journalists. There are literally tens of thousands of graduate students and ex-graduate students who know more about the intricacies of postmodern thought than Jordan Peterson does. Peterson’s tweeted and blogged responses to the Times piece are indicative of a person with virtually no sense of how he will be regarded by those who do not share his private system of reference. Why don’t you recognize that I’m not speaking of actual men and women but the symbolic Masculine and Feminine in Jungian archetypal thinking? Why don’t you know that “Enforced Monogamy” is an anthropological term? You won’t understand anything about Jordan Peterson until you realize that his confusion on these questions is entirely sincere.\nSo what does Peterson actually believe? He has consistently defended the moral position that the “individual is sovereign over the group,” a unique feature of Anglo-American political theory and practice that holds that citizens hold their rights against the state rather than through it, which is inscribed into our founding documents, and helps to account for the remarkable capacity of societies built around its doctrines to accommodate high levels of diversity while remaining democratic. The underlying sovereignty of individuals forces state power to operate against a hard constraint that limits coercion, and gives individuals the means by which to push back.\nThis position is not a “centrist” position between the poles of alt-right and the identity politics of the left, but a distinct position orthogonal to both. It rejects group identity as the foundation of politics in favor of strengthening the individual as a bulwark against what Peterson calls “ideological possession”—the temptation to subordinate the various ends of life into a contest for group dominance. Peterson sees the emergence of identity politics on both the right and left as a single phenomenon, with each pole feeding the growth of the other, as individuals lost amidst the chaos of contemporary life turn to ideologies providing simple solutions to complex questions, a corresponding set of friends—and a corresponding set of enemies. How anyone who has spent a single afternoon on Twitter can doubt that these polarizing group psychological dynamics exist—and explain the growth of political extremism at a time of relative prosperity—is frankly perplexing to me.\nSo, on the one hand, Peterson should be held responsible for some of his rhetoric, and he should take a bit more care to ensure that he\u0026rsquo;s being correctly understood by his various audiences. On the other hand, Peterson\u0026rsquo;s views are quite MODERATE. He is not the radical right-wing ideologue that many people make him out to be.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s YOUR take on Jordan Peterson?

The question was this: \u0026ldquo;In what ways is Bonhoeffer\u0026rsquo;s understanding of religion similar to, and different from, that of Barth?”\nAlthough we only spent a few minutes on that question in class, it\u0026rsquo;s been on my mind ever since.\nIn fact, it\u0026rsquo;s the reason I\u0026rsquo;m defending this dissertation proposal today — not because I’ve found the perfect answer to the question, but rather because I think I’ve found a better way to approach the question.\nYou see, every discussion of the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship that I’ve read eventually gets around to discussing the similarities and differences between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s critical understandings of religion. And rightly so, because this is the most confusing aspect of their relationship to explain.\nWhy does Bonhoeffer in prison, after adopting Barth’s theological critique of religion as idolatrous unbelief…\nWhy does Bonhoeffer, after claiming that the critique of religion was Barth’s greatest merit and original contribution as a theologian…\nWhy does Bonhoeffer say that Barth left us with nothing more than a “positivism of revelation” — a flattening of doctrines to the same relative importance, as a result of which the world is left to its own devices — whatever that means!\nWhy does Bonhoeffer then speak approvingly of a “religionless Christianity,” something that Barth explicitly refused to support?\nThis is the central mystery, as it were, of the Barth-Bonhoeffer relationship.\nSo far, scholars have attempted to solve it either by (1) proposing theological frameworks to explain Barth and Bonhoeffer’s differences, or by (2) proposing explanations of just what Bonhoeffer meant by the “positivism of revelation.”\nI do not mean to discount the work that’s been done already in these two areas. However, instead of proposing a theological framework or an explanation of “positivism of revelation,” I want to examine the connection between these two theologians’ critiques of religion and their use of Scripture.\nWhy? Because, despite John Webster’s suggestion about 18 years ago that examining each theologian’s use of Scripture would be a helpful way forward in explaining their relationship, no one has devoted lengthy attention to the relationship between Barth and Bonhoeffer’s theological critiques of religion and their interpretations of particular biblical passages.\nThis is what I would like to do. This will be my original contribution to scholarship.\nIf given permission, I will examine the connections between Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s theological interpretations of particular biblical texts and their theological critiques of religion.\nI believe that doing so will help us understand the historical and conceptual relationships between these two theologians. It will also inform a biblical critique of religion for the church’s use today.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/heres-the-elevator-pitch-for-my-dissertation-proposal-scriptural-but-not-religious/","summary":"Tomorrow, I defend the proposal for my dissertation.

Zak\u0026rsquo;s been working in the area of food ethics, and I asked him to write up a post about why Christians should care about these issues. It\u0026rsquo;s an area in which I need to make some changes in my own life. He delivered this thought-provoking and challenging piece. I hope you enjoy.\nIntroduction The three or so decisions you make each day about what to eat are some of the most consequential choices you make in your life.Author Wendell Berry notes that, “eating is an agricultural act.” That is, eating is more than just the satisfaction of appetite. Our plates are food’s final destination in a long supply chain that runs\nthrough a restaurant or grocery store, through food packing facilities, guided by the hands of food workers, often over thousands of miles via truck and train, through commodity processing facilities, all the way back to a farm. This backstory is both daunting and empowering, because the food choices we make - what we eat, and who we buy it from - send economic signals through all corners of this supply chain. As a part of a broken world, contemporary food production it is filled with injustice and often creates suffering. But, it does not have to be that way. The Bible clearly calls Christians to work towards a just future, to work with the grain of the gospel, as it were, by participating in the redemptive work that God is doing in the world. One of the most needed areas for this redemption is the modern food system.\nFactory Farming Most consumers assume that their meat comes from farms where animals graze and wander around green, pastoral landscapes. That could not be further from the truth.\nAnimal Suffering The vast majority (\u0026gt;99%) of the more than 10 billion chickens, turkeys, pigs, and cows slaughtered each year in the US for meat are raised on factory farms, industrial facilities often referred to as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Built to maximize efficiency and profits, these farms are hell on earth for their inhabitants. Animals are overcrowded and prevented from moving freely or performing natural behaviors. Many never see sunlight or grass at any point in their lives, and are fed unnatural diets of subsidized feed crops such as corn and soybeans — enduring miserable lives that are cut short by slaughter. To ensure that they reach slaughter weight quickly, chickens have been bred to feel constant hunger and eat constantly. Breeds that used to take 6 months to reach full size now regularly attain that weight in one month. To put that growth in perspective, imagine a human baby reaching full physical maturity atage 3, instead of taking 18 years. As a consequence of this rapid growth, many chickens have an insufficient skeletal structure and are frequently crippled by bones that break under the stress of their unnaturally large weight.All of this cruelty would be illegal if done to companion animals like dogs or horses, but it is regularly inflicted on billions of animals who have similar levels of intelligence and emotional complexity without a second thought. Cows, pigs, chickens, and other animals experience a wide range of emotions, including curiosity, pleasure, pain, fear, joy, anger, sadness, playfulness and more. They most certainly have the capacity to suffer, and suffer they do, innumerable animals in unimaginable conditions.\nEnvironmental Costs In addition, animal agriculture comes with a hefty environmental price tag. Meat production is resource-intensive: Producing one pound of feedlot beef takes an average of 2,500 gallons of water, 12 pounds of grain, 35 pounds of topsoil and one gallon of gasoline. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation found that almost 80% of the planet’s total agricultural land is used for feeding or processing meat. Globally, animal agriculture emits more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation system - all cars, trains, planes and ships - and is responsible for more emissions than any other economic sector.\nThe Grain of the Gospel: Eden, Shalom, and the World to Come The current food system bears all the markings of a broken system, and is surely not what Christians should envision for a redeemed world. The gospel message is that creation was made good, it belongs to God, it is in a broken state, but God is at work redeeming the world and bringing about its complete reconciliation.\nThe Created World In the original created order of Eden, all creatures lived peacefully in community, and God told humans to consume only plant-based foods:\n“Then God said, ‘I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.’ And it was so.” (Genesis 1.29–31)\nAnimals were not created to be food for humans or for each other, but to be companions:\n“The Lord God said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.’ Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. [God] brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals” (Genesis 2.19-20)\nIn this context, the God-given “dominion” over animals implies a parent-child relationship, not a hunter-hunted dynamic. As this piece from PETA LAMBS puts it:\n“God created humans in God’s image and according to God’s likeness and told humans to steward this new creation. And what is God’s likeness? Throughout the Scripture, God shows us mercy that we do not deserve, grace that we have not earned, and love that we cannot imagine. We are made in that likeness and are charged with reflecting those qualities to the whole of creation. Being made in the image of God is a call to caretaking, compassion, and mercy.”\nEden was a herbivorous world, filled with animals that were created to be companions with humans. Eating meat begins after human pride and greed allow brokenness into the world.\nThe Fallen World In the new human-created order, Creation has been marred, good things have been repurposed for evil, blood is being shed, and instead of living in a peaceful community of God’s original design, humans are now violent toward animals and each other.We can choose to live either with or against the grain of the gospel. Every time we eat meat, we necessarily participate in this fallen order and comply with the imperfections of this world. But, when we avoid killing other creatures, our efforts are directed away from brokenness and towards reversing the curse. While the Fall is a part of our present reality, Christians are called to work towards reversing its effects, not accentuating them. The Fall is the way the world is, but Eden and Heaven are the way it should be, and it seems good for Christians to participate in building the fully redeemed world to come rather than deepening the effects of the Fall.\nThe Future World Prophecies such as Isaiah 11.6–9 seem to foresee a return to this vegetarian world:\nThe wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze; their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder\u0026rsquo;s den. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.\nThe redeemed world to come, the kingdom that God is building on earth, is an herbivorous kingdom, free from death and suffering.\nGod declares ownership of animals ( Psalm 50.10) God will protect all creatures (Isaiah 7.18-25), and they will all worship their Creator (Isaiah 43.20) Righteous people are mindful of the needs of animals (Proverbs 12:10) God makes a covenant with animals (Hosea 2.18) God did not necessarily desire animal sacrifices (Isaiah 1.11) The murder of an ox or a human are both described as wrong (Isaiah 66.3) God seems concerned for the welfare of both animals and people (Jonah 4.11) In the future, reconciled world, the wolf will lie down with the lamb, and a child will lead them. Hurt and destruction will pass away, and the lion will eat straw like the ox (Isaiah 11.3-9 and 65.25) Is this a valid theological argument? It is important to note that Christians should not always operate on the basis of the world to come in the midst of the world as it is. There will not be marriage in the world to come (Matt. 22.30), nor will people teach each other about God (Jer. 31:34), but these are both acceptable things to do in the present age. Why should eating meat be any different? With their roots going back beyond the Fall to God\u0026rsquo;s good creation, marriage and teaching about God are good things to do in the present, but will become unnecessary in the world to come. Eating meat, on the other hand, cannot be traced back beyond the Fall. It is an unneeded, negative act in the present and will be impossible in a fully redeemed world. We do not have the license to act violently in the present world just because the future perfect world is not yet fully realized.When we eat meat-free diets, we are participating in the redemptive work that God is doing in the world, actualizing a future where humans and animals will live in community as nonviolent companions. Matthew C. Halteman summarizes it well:\n“Caring for animals was the very first responsibility bestowed to humankind by God—our very first chance to practice the capacities of love, power, and mercy that accompany the divine image within us\u0026hellip;Someone seeking to eat mindfully aspires to live toward the biblical ideal of shalom—the peaceful state of holistic flourishing that is portrayed first in Eden and last on the holy mountain of the prophet Isaiah’s vision of a fully redeemed world.”\nConclusion Reducing meat consumption has many benefits:\nGlobal poverty reduction: Food costs would decrease as less crops would be used for meat production and instead fed directly to humans Reduced animal suffering: Fewer animals would be bred and raised in terrible conditions Improved public health: Risks for cardiovascular disease and cancer - together responsible for 50% of U.S. deaths - would be reduced Healthier planet: Air \u0026amp; water pollution would be reduced and far fewer resources would be needed to produce our food Eating is an agricultural, economic, and spiritual act.Because we can eat either with or against the grain of the gospel, Christians need to see ethical food choices as everyday acts of virtue. Christians need to become food theologians, acquiring a moral imagination that sees animals as valuable co-heirs of the present and future world, and finding ways to look beyond the habits and comforts of our current food system to participate in a better, redeemed alternative.\nWant to learn more? If you are interested in reducing your meat consumption, there are numerous organizations that can guide you through the process of finding delicious, healthy, and inexpensive alternatives.

(Or perhaps it was this episode.)\nHowever, I could be mistaken, because Peterson\u0026rsquo;s been popping up in conversation all over the place in my circles. Blog posts, podcast episodes, conversations with friends - Peterson has been popping up everywhere, so it seems.\nGerald McDermott\u0026rsquo;s Take My old seminary professor, Gerald McDermott, has blogged about Peterson\u0026rsquo;s new book, \u0026quot; 12 Rules for Life: an Antidote to Chaos,\u0026quot; saying:\nIt is a good book, blunt and inspiring.\nWe live in a time when so many young (and not so young) people feel lost, unsure of how they should approach their lives, or life in general. Mr. Peterson talks about the attitudes that will help find the path. It is not a politically correct or officially approved path, but it is an intensely practical and yet heightened one: This life you’re living has meaning.\nScot McKnight\u0026rsquo;s Blog\u0026rsquo;s (Patrick Mitchell\u0026rsquo;s) Take Furthermore, Scot McKnight blogged (or rather, published a guest post by Patrick Mitchell) about Peterson\u0026rsquo;s 12 Rules:\nWhat is he saying?\nThis is a big question because, as he says himself, he talks a lot, often too much and often at speed. He also covers a lot of ground from psychology, to philosophy, to men and women, to the Bible, to politics, to the world of work and freedom of speech. What follows is a snap-shot, drawn from listening to Peterson over the last year.\nAnd the fact that what he is saying is now seen as ‘provocative’ or ‘radical’ or ‘patriarchal’ or ‘extreme’ says more about a contemporary culture of relativism and victimhood than it does about Peterson. Finding out more about his ‘reputation’, I have had to keep asking myself, ‘am I missing something?’. ‘Is this guy a member of some secret right-wing network?’ For I can’t see the evidence in his academic lectures, written material or YouTube videos.\nThe rest of the post is a pretty detailed look at various aspects of Peterson\u0026rsquo;s thought.\nThe Infamous Channel 4 Interview Both of those blogs mention Peterson\u0026rsquo;s now infamous Channel 4 interview where Cathy Newman adopts some pretty aggressive and apparently unfair interviewing tactics (listen for \u0026ldquo;so you\u0026rsquo;re saying\u0026hellip;,\u0026rdquo; followed by caricatures of Peterson\u0026rsquo;s claims):\nOther Takes on Peterson First, here are a couple explicitly \u0026ldquo;theological\u0026rdquo; takes:\nFirst Things: \u0026ldquo;Jordan Peterson, Unlikely Guru\u0026rdquo; (Matthew Schmitz) Schmitz\u0026rsquo;s entire piece is worth reading, but here was the kicker, in my opinion:\nWhat critics and fans alike miss is just how unlikely a guru Peterson is. Though he brims with sympathy for the confused, he is uncertain about where they should go. He advocates for rules but is vague on who should set them. He believes in the importance of religion, but he doesn’t quite have one.\nSchmitz concludes the piece with:\nYoung men look to Peterson for answers, but he is still turning the kaleidoscope, searching for pattern and form. Earlier this year, an interviewer for VICE asked him, “Who is your target audience, who are you trying to reach?” With eyes downcast he said, “Partly me.”\nThink Theology: \u0026ldquo;Peterson, Driscoll, and the Millenial Man\u0026rdquo; (Matthew Hosier) Mathew Hosier, at Think Theology, confesses that some of Peterson\u0026rsquo;s talk of personal responsibility reminds him of Mark Driscoll. Nevertheless, he admits that he thinks Peterson is different than Driscoll:\nWhatever the rights and wrongs of what happened at Mars Hill, it is undeniable that Driscoll’s genius was connecting with and motivating young men. They responded in their droves to his yelling at them to take responsibility for themselves and others. He painted a picture of the possible that was more compelling for many Millennials than the needs-based, rights-oriented culture in which they had been raised.\nPeterson has observed how his lectures attract a surprisingly large number of young men too. Peterson is a very different character from Driscoll, but his challenge to young men to ‘pick up the heaviest rock you can and carry it’ is strikingly similar. Many Millennial young men seem confused about what it is to be a man and something leaps in them when another man tells them what they can do about it: shoulder a load, take some responsibility, clean your room and make life better for you and for those around you.\nOther, less (explicitly) theological takes on Peterson abound:\nThe Atlantic: \u0026ldquo;Why Can\u0026rsquo;t People Hear What Jordan Peterson is saying?\u0026rdquo; (Connor Friesdorf) Focusing on the Channel 4 interview, Friesdorf concludes:\n\u0026hellip;this is neither an endorsement nor a condemnation of Peterson’s views. It is an argument that the effects of the approach used in this interview are pernicious.\nFor one, those who credulously accept the interviewer’s characterizations will emerge with the impression that a prominent academic holds troubling views that, in fact, he does not actually believe or advocate. Some will feel needlessly troubled. And distorted impressions of what figures like Peterson mean by the words that they speak can only exacerbate overall polarization between their followers and others, and sap their critics of credibility to push back where they are wrong.\nVox: \u0026ldquo;Jordan Peterson, Explained\u0026rdquo; (Zack Beauchamp) Zack Beauchamp has a long write-up on Jordan Peterson in Vox magazine, which concludes:\nBut Peterson has inextricably intertwined his self-help approach with a kind of reactionary politics that validates white, straight, and cisgender men at the expense of everyone else. He gives them a sense of purpose by, in part, tearing other people down — by insisting that the world can and should revolve around them and their problems.\nThis painful contrast is on display later in that very interview, in which he explicitly argues that concern for sexism is to blame for the plight of the West’s young men.\n“We’re so stupid. We’re alienating young men. We’re telling them that they’re patriarchal oppressors and denizens of rape culture,” he says. “It’s awful. It’s so destructive. It’s so unnecessary. And it’s so sad.”\nThe empathy that he displays for men and boys in his BBC interview and 12 Rules for Life is touching. The problem is that he can’t seem to extend it to anyone else.\nNOTE: From what I know of Peterson, Beauchamp\u0026rsquo;s take strikes me as unfair. Peterson himself isn\u0026rsquo;t trying to validate \u0026ldquo;white, straight, and cisgender men at the expense of everyone else\nThe New York Times: \u0026ldquo;The Jordan Peterson Moment\u0026rdquo; (David Brooks) In my opinion, David Brooks hits the nail on the head here:\nMuch of Peterson’s advice sounds to me like vague exhortatory banality. Like Hobbes and Nietzsche before him, he seems to imagine an overly brutalistic universe, nearly without benevolence, beauty, attachment and love. His recipe for self-improvement is solitary, nonrelational, unemotional. I’d say the lives of young men can be improved more through loving attachment than through Peterson’s joyless and graceless calls to self-sacrifice.\nHowever, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exactly call Peterson\u0026rsquo;s calls to self-sacrifice \u0026ldquo;joyless and graceless.\u0026rdquo;\nThe New Yorker: \u0026ldquo;Jordan Peterson\u0026rsquo;s Gospel of Masculinity\u0026rdquo; (Kelefa Sanneh) Similarly, I think that Kelefa Sanneh hits the nail on the head here:\nPeterson sometimes asks audiences to view him as an alternative to political excesses on both sides. During an interview on BBC Radio 5, he said, “I’ve had thousands of letters from people who were tempted by the blandishments of the radical right, who’ve moved towards the reasonable center as a consequence of watching my videos.” But he typically sees liberals, or leftists, or “postmodernists,” as aggressors—which leads him, rather ironically, to frame some of those on the “radical right” as victims. Many of his political stances are built on this type of inversion. Postmodernists, he says, are obsessed with the idea of oppression, and, by waging war on oppressors real and imagined, they become oppressors themselves. Liberals, he says, are always talking about the importance of compassion—and yet “there’s nothing more horrible for children, and developing people, than an excess of compassion.” (This horror, he says, is embodied in the figure of the “Freudian devouring mother”; as an example, he cites Ursula, the sea witch from “The Little Mermaid.”) The danger, it seems, is that those who want to improve Western society may end up destroying it.\nAlright, time for some thoughts of my own.\nMy Current Take on Jordan Peterson First, he\u0026rsquo;s definitely on to something. There\u0026rsquo;s no denying it, Jordan Peterson is striking a chord. And, I believe, that\u0026rsquo;s at least partially due to the fact that he\u0026rsquo;s RIGHT.\nDespite the existence of structural sins and systems of oppression, it simply will not do to blame the world for all of one\u0026rsquo;s problems. At some point, we must take responsibility for our own lives.\nI believe that the Christian doctrine of the imago Dei \u0026ndash; of humans being created in the image of God \u0026ndash; can theologically underwrite Peterson\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on responsibility. We humans have been created by God and given stewardship over the earth (see Genesis 1-2). Perhaps, despite the effects of the Fall (see Genesis 3), we have more control over our lives than we might realize.\nFurthermore, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of content in biblical Wisdom Literature (see Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, especially) to support what Peterson is saying about how to live your life in a way that fights back against the chaos of the world.\nAnd yet, his individualism worries me. Sure, we\u0026rsquo;re created in the imago Dei, and that means we have control and responsibility for our lives.\nAnd yet, humans are communal creatures. So, if we overemphasize individual responsibility, we might end up underemphasizing the ways in which we are responsible for one another, including \u0026ndash; and especially \u0026ndash; the oppressed and the outcasts.\nNow, Peterson is prone to claim that any talk of systemic oppression these days is due to the Radical Left, but I don\u0026rsquo;t buy his over-generalizations on that count. The Bible seems to bear witness to the existence of structural sin, and Christians must take systems of oppression into account as they discern how to follow Jesus.\nGranted, Peterson isn\u0026rsquo;t simply saying \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s every man for himself, forget about the losers.\u0026rdquo; He\u0026rsquo;s much more nuanced than that.\nBut still, I find his views of the world \u0026ndash; at least as expressed in 12 Rules for Life \u0026ndash; to be more individualistic than the account I see in Christian Scripture.\nFurthermore, he seems to fall into the very trap he attempts to avoid: victimhood. Peterson is trying to provide an alternative, a middle way, to the Radical Left and the Radical Right. However, some of his rhetoric about the Radical Left \u0026ndash; justified though it may be in certain circumstances, given what appear to be widespread mischaracterizations of his thought! \u0026ndash; sometimes seem to fall into the very trap of \u0026ldquo;victimhood\u0026rdquo; that he encourages his audience to avoid.\nIt goes something like this: Peterson claims that it\u0026rsquo;s the Radical Left that\u0026rsquo;s oppressing people \u0026ndash; specifically, men \u0026ndash; by insisting that people are either oppressors or the oppressed.\nAgain, Peterson\u0026rsquo;s not flat-footed or unnuanced about this, but in some of his less-careful moments, he seems to fall into what he\u0026rsquo;s labeling as the Radical Left\u0026rsquo;s trap by painting himself and his audience as victims of a Radical Leftist conspiracy theory.\nThen again, perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s because Peterson\u0026rsquo;s been the target of quite a few misinterpretations and attacks. Maybe he gets some grace to have certain less-careful moments, as it were.\nAnd yet, if he\u0026rsquo;s really going to provide a middle way between Right and Left ideologies, he needs to avoid the victim/oppressed rhetoric consistently.\nFinally, he plays fast and loose with divine revelation and religious traditions. I think it\u0026rsquo;s great that Peterson has respect for religion and religious narratives.\nAnd yet, I think it\u0026rsquo;s pretty awful that Peterson feels free to float lightly above all religious narratives and basically craft a Petersonian \u0026ldquo;meta-religion\u0026rdquo; of his own out of the bits and pieces of religious narratives that he finds most useful and compelling.\nSure, sometimes his theological interpretation of biblical texts seems pretty thought-provoking, excellent, and faithful to the Christian tradition. However, at other times I find myself bracing at the idiosyncrasies of his interpretations \u0026ndash; not to mention the ease with which he pulls in building blocks from various traditions to craft his own narrative. It makes me wonder if adherents of other religious traditions would feel a similar unease when their narratives are used in such a construction project.\nBy respecting all/most religious traditions, Peterson may very well end up respecting no particular religious tradition. As a Christian theologian, I find that troublesome.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s worth reading. After listening to the book on Audible, I bought myself a physical copy of 12 Rules for Life.\nI plan to read the book again and discuss it with friends. It\u0026rsquo;s currently the top non-fiction book on Amazon for good reason: it\u0026rsquo;s thought-provoking and it will get you thinking deeper about how to live your life in this world.\nThose Amazon links above are affiliate links.

While Perman’s book is fantastic and thorough, Challies’ book has the advantage of being MUCH shorter (120 pages vs. 383 pages).\nPut simply, as far as bang-for-the-buck (or bang-for-the-page), Do More Better is the best reading recommendation I can make if you’d like to learn more about a Christian approach to personal productivity. Do More Better, An Overview Know Your Purpose Chapter one, Know Your Purpose, is devoted to the maxim that, as a Christian, your purpose is to glorify God by doing good to others.\nAnswer the Call In chapter two, Answer the Call, Challies discusses the “Producitivity Thieves” of Laziness, Busyness, “BusyLazy,” and Thorns \u0026amp; Thistles. He also places personal productivity in its proper context in the Christian life, rightly stating that:\n“God calls you to productivity, but he calls you to the right kind of productivity. He calls you to be productive for his sake, not your own. While this book will emphasize tools and systems and other important elements of productivity, nothing is more important than your own holiness and your own godliness. No amount of organization and time management will compensate for a lack of Christian character, not when it comes to this great calling of glory through good — bringing glory to God by doing good to others” (25).\nDefine Your Responsibilities In chapter three, Define Your Responsibilities, Challies walks us through the process of defining and listing the various areas of responsibility in our lives (Personal, Family, Church, School, Work, Social, etc.), as well as our roles within those various areas of responsibility. Defining and listing both of these things provides the map/framework for what follows.\nState Your Mission In chapter four, State Your Mission, Challies covers the process of developing mission/purpose statements for each of the Areas of Responsibility from chapter three. This completes the “audit” of one’s life, before moving on to the tools of productivity in chapter five.\nSelect Your Tools This is where things get really practical.\nAccording to Challies, everyone needs the following three tools:\nA Task Management Tool (he recommends ToDoist, which I also use) A Scheduling Tool (he recommends Google Calendar, which I also use) An Information Tool (he recommends Evernote, which I also use) He also introduces the extremely important productivity principle: a home for everything, and like goes with like.\nCollect Your Tasks, Plan Your Calendar, and Gather Your Information In chapter six, Collect Your Tasks, Challies walks us through the process of setting up and beginning to use ToDoist. Chapter seven, Plan Your Calendar, is devoted to setting up and using Google Calendar. Chapter eight, Gather Your Information, is (you guessed it) devoted to setting up and using Evernote.\nThese three chapters are insanely helpful if you’re not already familiar with these three powerful tools!\nLive the System In chapter nine, Live the System, Challies covers how the three productivity tools work together in a cohesive personal productivity system on a daily level. This chapter contains a bunch of helpful information on how to prioritize and structure your day.\nMaintain it Consistently Chapter ten, Maintain It Consistently, expands the horizon of focus to the weekly level. Challies walks us through the important process of the Weekly Review, focusing on the power of checklists and how we can “serve and surprise” in each of our areas of responsibilities and roles.\nBonus Material As a bonus, Do More Better ends with 6 Tips for Doing More Better with Email and 20 Tips to Increase Your Productivity. My favorite tip from this section of the book is “6. Create a Not-To-Do-List”!\n“Create a note within Evernote that will contain a not-to-do-list. Make this a list of bad productivity habits you are trying to break, and go over this list each week during your weekly review. My not-to-do-list includes ‘Do not dring coffee after 2 p.m.,’ ‘Do not leave email open all day,’ and ‘Do not agree to meethings that have no agenda or no end-time’ (116-17).”\nAgain, I know of no better, briefer Christian approach to personal productivity than Do More Better If you’re looking for a personal productivity system of your own, in order to do more for the glory of God and the good of others, pick up Challies’ book today!\nWant to read more about productivity? If you’re currently a student, especially in high school or college, check out Challies’ student edition of Do More Better:\nOtherwise, if you’d like an even deeper dive into a Christian approach to productivity, the best book I know of is Matt Perman’s What’s Best Next: How the Gospel Transforms the Way You Get Things Done:\nNote: some links above are Amazon affiliate links.

Maybe you, like me, have a difficult time walking the tightrope between feeling quickly overwhelmed by interpersonal relationships, on the one hand, and feeling incredibly lonely, on the other hand.\nMaybe you, like me, feel these problems acutely as a male (although I’m sure that females are having their own relational struggles as our culture increasingly pressures us all to be “alone together,” looking at our screens instead of looking each other in the eye).\nMaybe we’re not alone.\nThe Lonely American Man I just got done listening to a fantastic episode of the podcast Hidden Brain called The Lonely American Man.\nI highly recommend that you give this episode a listen, because it’s devoted to an important topic: how certain Western/American ideals of masculinity - the mythic man as a rugged individualist, needing no one in order to succeed - have led to men feeling increasingly isolated and lonely as they grow older.\nI really resonated with this episode. Although my current role as a Ph.D. student (and my previous roles as a high school student, college student, and then a seminarian) have included some built-in male “acquaintances/colleagues,” at the very least, I’ve recognized how each stage has felt increasingly lonely. In fact, my closest male friendships now are with a couple people I know from high school - and we only see each other in person 1 or 2 times a year.\nSure, I spend more time face-to-face with my male Ph.D. colleagues, but we’re all just so busy. School, work, marriage, kids, etc. At least for me, in addition to feeling the pressure to not be overly emotional or vulnerable, there’s the added pressure of not wanting to burden other people. I know they’re busy. They know I’m busy. So, we end up just leaving each other alone, persuaded that’s what will make us happy (even if we feel terribly lonely).\nIf you listen to the end of the podcast episode I linked to above, you’ll hear about an interesting study/experiment performed on commuters. When given the choice/assignment of (1) not interacting with other commuters, (2) interacting with other commuters, and (3) carrying on as normal during their commute, people predicted that they would be happiest - and that other people would be happiest! - when they just stayed out of each other’s way. However, it turns out that we’re much happier when connecting with other people, and that other people are much more willing to connect with us than we often imagine!\nMen, How Can We Do Better? I need to do a better job of taking these things to heart in how I go about my daily life. Although I truly am an introvert - meaning that I need some time alone each day in order to recharge - I’m persuaded that I could benefit from some more meaningful friendships in my life - especially some more face-to-face friendships.\nAlthough I’m sure there’s other great stuff on this topic out there, if you’re interested in this topic, I highly recommend the following posts from The Art of Manliness:\n“Making and Keeping Man Friendships” This post contains the following advice on making man/male friendships: - Join an organization - Make some friends at work - Meet your neighbors\nThen, when it comes to maintaining male friendships: - Set a common goal - Create a competition - Take a \u0026ldquo;Mancation\u0026rdquo; - Have a \u0026ldquo;Guys Night Out\u0026rdquo; - Keep in touch with regular communication\n“The History and Nature of Man Friendships” Male friendships have changed a LOT over the past couple hundred years.

A regular writing habit, day in and day out.\nHow to develop/change a habit There are plenty of guides out there on the internet about the process of habit formation. Here are a few:\nThe Habits Guide: How to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones[James Clear] Habits: How They Form and How to Break Them [NPR] The Four Habits that Form Habits [Zen Habits] Furthermore, there are two excellent books on habit formation that I highly recommend:\nThe Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg Better than Before: What I Learned About Making and Breaking Habits\u0026ndash;to Sleep More, Quit Sugar, Procrastinate Less, and Generally Build a Happier Life by Gretchen Rubin Habit = Trigger + Behavior + Reward If you look through those resources, you’ll notice a particular model that appears again and again. A habit boils down to three things (this version of the framework mainly comes from Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit . You can read the appendix of the book for free here.) :\nTRIGGER: The cue or reminder that prompts the behavior. Frequently, cues involve\nTime Location People (who are you with?) Preceding Action (what did you just do?) Emotion BEHAVIOR: The behavior itself, whether something good for you, like writing 500 words every day, or something bad for you, like smoking a pack of cigarettes.\nREWARD: The benefit you get from the behavior.\nTo change an old habit (taken from this helpful flowchart from Charles Duhigg): Isolate the consistent TRIGGER. When you feel the craving to do the thing you’re trying to stop doing, ask yourself: What time is it? Where are you? Who else is around? What did you just do? What emotion are you feeling? Isolate the consistent REWARD. What benefit/craving is this habit providing/satisfying? Come up with an idea and test the theory by substituting different rewards until you find something that makes the craving goes away. This is what you’re really craving as a result of the behavior. Insert a new BEHAVIOR between the trigger and the reward. Choose a new activity that is triggered by the old trigger and provides the old reward. Write this commitment down in the following form: “When [TRIGGER occurs], I will [do the new BEHAVIOR], because it provides me with [the REWARD].” Follow through on your plan! To develop a new habit (taken from this helpful flowchart from Charles Duhigg): Come up with a TRIGGER: Time? Location? People around? Immediately preceding action? Emotion? Come up with a REWARD for after the behavior: Make sure you actually enjoy it! Make sure that you crave this reward when exposed to the trigger from the previous step! Ideally, you will eventually desire the habit for its intrinsic reward. That’s what you’re shooting for. Insert the BEHAVIOR into a routine: Write it down in the following form: “When [TRIGGER occurs], I will [perform desired BEHAVIOR], because it provides me with [the REWARD].” Follow through on your plan! How to develop a writing habit: my example In theory, it’s pretty simple, actually. We just need to take the previous outline, for how to develop a new habit, and apply it to the specific behavior of writing consistently. 500 words a day is a great goal, and it’s the one I’ll be using.\nFirst, however, we need a TRIGGER. For me, the trigger I’m going to try out for the next few days is “When I arrive at the library in the morning, before doing anything else…”\nThe REWARD I’m going to experiment with is: “…I will go for a 20-minute walk outside.”\nPut together, my commitment looks like: “When I arrive at the library in the morning, before doing anything else, I will write 500 words, because then I get to go for a 20-minute walk outside.”\nWhat about you?

Therefore, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a system in place for reliably and comprehensively keeping track of all the random \u0026ldquo;open loops\u0026rdquo; your brain comes up with throughout the day, you will use up a lot of your mental bandwidth trying to keep track of all those things, instead of moving forward on them.\nEnter the GTD system.

Getting Back on the GTD Bandwagon Unfortunately, after following GTD for a few years, I \u0026ldquo;fell off the bandwagon.\u0026rdquo; I started to get sloppy with my practices of capturing and clarifying my \u0026ldquo;open loops,\u0026rdquo; so I started to spend more of my time worrying about what I had to get done that I was forgetting about, instead of reviewing my \u0026ldquo;Next Action\u0026rdquo; lists and getting things done, GTD-style.\nSo, just this past week, I decided to get back on the GTD bandwagon. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a Ph.D. dissertation to write and a baby on the way, after all! There\u0026rsquo;s no time to spend all day worrying about the things I\u0026rsquo;m forgetting! :)\nMy GTD Tools ToDoist ToDoist is a fantastic task manager. I use it to keep track of my personal tasks and projects.\nGoogle Calendar I use Google Calendar as my\u0026hellip;calendar. Pretty straightforward. :)\nGmail I use Gmail for email communication. In addition to folders created automatically by Unroll.Me and Boomerang (two FANTASTIC things to use in conjunction with Gmail), I have three simple folders:\n@ACTION_SUPPORT @KEEP @WAITING_FOR_SUPPORT If I receive an email that requires action from me, I place it in the @ACTION_SUPPORT folder and create a task in ToDoist reminding me to do the action.\nIf I receive an email that doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain an action, but that I want to keep for reference purposes, I either click \u0026ldquo;Archive\u0026rdquo; in GMail, or I move it to the \u0026ldquo;@KEEP\u0026rdquo; folder.\nIf I have an email that I can\u0026rsquo;t take the next action on, but that I\u0026rsquo;m waiting for someone to take an action before I can move forward, I create a task in ToDoist reminding me to follow up on this, and I move the email to the @WAITING_FOR_SUPPORT folder.\nEvernote Evernote is basically my second brain and reference file system. Everything from old receipts to class notes is in there.\nLeuchtturm1917 Medium Size Hardcover A5 Notebook - Dotted Grid This is my favorite notebook and tool for \u0026ldquo;capturing\u0026rdquo; ideas, projects, actions, etc.\nSome Good Overviews of GTD The best overview of the GTD system is the aforementioned book, \u0026quot; Getting Things Done.\u0026quot;\nHowever, there are also some very helpful free overviews of the GTD system out there.\nHow to Hack Your To-Do List https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1\u0026amp;v=Xduzwk04l2E\nWatch and Listen to David Allen Himself Summarize GTD Productivity 101: A Primer to the Getting Things Done (GTD) Philosophy [LifeHacker] GTD in 15 minutes – A Pragmatic Guide to Getting Things Done [Hamberg.no] Getting Things Done (GTD) by David Allen - Animated Book Summary And Review Want to try GTD?

The song is called \u0026ldquo;The Truth is a Cave,\u0026rdquo; and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I\u0026rsquo;m calling \u0026ldquo;the theological journey\u0026rdquo; - the stages one goes through in one\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of God.\nThe Truth is [NOT] a Cave Here\u0026rsquo;s a video. Give the song a listen.\nHere are the lyrics:\nI was young and naive As I was told, so I believed And I was told there\u0026rsquo;s only one road that leads you home\nAnd the truth was a cave on the mountainside And I\u0026rsquo;d seek it out until the day I died\nI was bound and determined To be the child that you wanted But I was blind to every sign you left for me to find\nAnd the truth became a tool that I held in my hand I wielded it, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand\nI got tired of giving more than you gave to me And I desired a truth I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to seek\nBut in the silence, I heard you calling out to me\nThe Truth is neither a Position, nor a Possession, but a Person. ˆThere\u0026rsquo;s my summary of the song\u0026rsquo;s message in a nutshell.\nVerse one portrays the truth as a distant and unattainable cave. I think that\u0026rsquo;s where we all start off in our theological journeys. The danger at this beginning stage is that God feels very distant and aloof. If we\u0026rsquo;re not careful, we can tire out and despair while \u0026ldquo;seeking out [the truth] until the day [we] die.\u0026rdquo;\nHowever, things don\u0026rsquo;t get any better in verse two, where the truth is a tool. We, especially formal students of theology like myself, can quickly get caught up in our zeal for theological truth (\u0026ldquo;I was bound and determined / To be the child that you wanted\u0026rdquo;), missing the ways in which God actually wants to speak to us (\u0026ldquo;But I was blind to every sign you left for me to find\u0026rdquo;).\nThe result? We act like the truth about God is something we can possess and use to our own advantage. We treat theology like a swordfight or a dojo.\nThis gets us to verse three, the stage of the burnt-out theologian: \u0026ldquo;I got tired of giving more than you gave to me. And I desired a truth I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to seek.\u0026rdquo;\nI could pretend like I don\u0026rsquo;t know why those words often bring tears to my eyes, but I do.\nPour your heart, mind, and soul into the theological task - as if it all depends on you and your zealous efforts to plumb the depths of the divine mysteries - and you will be brought to anger and/or despair by a world that so often feels godless, if not god-forsaken.\nGood news, though: It doesn\u0026rsquo;t all depend on you and your theological efforts. God reveals himself to us, even (especially) when we least expect it: \u0026ldquo;But in the silence, I heard you calling out to me.\u0026rdquo;\nGood news: The truth isn\u0026rsquo;t a cave.\nThe truth isn\u0026rsquo;t a tool.\nThe truth is a Person.

The main reason for the trip was to visit some good friends of ours, the Smith family, in Phoenix, AZ. Here\u0026rsquo;s a picture of the group of us together after church at Living Faith Anglican Church in Tempe, AZ, where my friend Peter Smith is the rector.\nThe trip was a blast. It was great to catch up with the Smiths and to see their new home and church in Arizona.\nPlus, we got to go hiking at (1) Saguaro Lake,\n(2) Cathedral Rock in Sedona,\nand (3) the South Kaibab Trail at the Grand Canyon.\n(That last photo is my favorite from the entire trip. Thanks to the random guy on the trail who took it for us!)\nHaving never been to the Southwest before, I was frequently overwhelmed by the beauty of the views and the landscape. At certain points, it didn\u0026rsquo;t even feel real.\nHowever, something else struck me about the views and the landscape: the combination of danger and beauty. At the Grand Canyon, this was especially obvious when we considered how high above the canyon floor we were during our hike. However, even when we weren\u0026rsquo;t sitting or standing on a precarious ledge, even when we were standing on flat ground, we were still in the middle of the desert! Without food, water, shelter, and transportation, the beautiful landscape would have made short work of us.\nThis has me thinking about the relationships between beauty, safety, and danger in other areas of life. We\u0026rsquo;d love it, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t we, if the most beautiful things/experiences were always safe. But they aren\u0026rsquo;t.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s frequently risk and danger involved in life\u0026rsquo;s most beautiful and meaningful experiences.\nOf course, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we ought to live life recklessly, with no concern for the risks and dangers involved!\nBut it is a good reminder that we are, perhaps, more concerned with safety and risk-mitigation than God is.\nDo you have any examples of dangerous, risky beauty in your own life? I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear about them in the comments below! P.S.

In fact, finding more time to read is one of the main reasons why you should learn the basics of personal productivity and time management (see my posts about productivity and time management).\nHowever, even if you manage to find more time to read, it can be very helpful to improve your reading speed.\nAs a Ph.D. student, this is something that I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to get better at in recent months. I\u0026rsquo;d like to share my top tip/trick. Here it is:\nUse a Pen/Pencil/Finger as a Pacer When You Read That\u0026rsquo;s right. Whenever I read these days, I\u0026rsquo;m using something as a pacer, tracing under each line of text as I read it. (I\u0026rsquo;m usually also standing and pacing around to avoid falling asleep!)\nIt might seem stupidly simple tip, but it\u0026rsquo;s crazy how much using something - whether a pen, pencil, or just your finger - as a pacer can help you read faster. It cuts down on the number of times your eye bounces around on the page, and it enables you to read exactly as quickly as you\u0026rsquo;d like to - you can slow down or speed up at will.\nI first considered using a pacer while reading after reading Tim Ferriss\u0026rsquo;s wildly popular blog post, \u0026ldquo;Scientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20 Minutes\u0026rdquo;. I encourage you to give that post a read if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.\nOr, if you\u0026rsquo;d rather watch a video of Tim teaching his technique, check this one out:\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwEquW_Yij0[/embed]\nAnyways, I hope this simple tip helps you to read faster when you want to!

None of us has \u0026ldquo;arrived.\u0026rdquo;\nThere\u0026rsquo;s always more to learn about who God is, what God has done, and how we can join God\u0026rsquo;s mission to set the world right again. And, even if we know a bunch about those things in the previous sentence, we surely don\u0026rsquo;t always live based on that knowledge!\nThankfully, there are a TON of resources out there that promise to help us grow in our walk with God. Unfortunately, there are a TON of resources out there. Seriously, where are you supposed to begin? I just went to Amazon, and there are over 200,000 results in the category of Books \u0026gt; Christian Books and Bibles \u0026gt; Christian Living. To narrow things down, I clicked on the sub-category \u0026ldquo;Spiritual Growth,\u0026rdquo; and there are still over 40,000 results.\nLook, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to slight all of these Spiritual Growth resources out there. I really don\u0026rsquo;t. Some of them are excellent, and I may even write one of my own someday.\nHowever, in my view, the explosion of spiritual growth material creates/exacerbates the danger of an individualistic and consumeristic approach to the Christian life. If you wanted to, you could spend the rest of your life bouncing around from niche spiritual growth resource to niche spiritual growth resource. From one book study to the next. Getting tired of something? Try something new!\nWhile there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with novelty or changing things up to keep one\u0026rsquo;s spiritual life fresh, as it were, the danger is that we might end up with nothing but novelty, nothing but our individual interests driving our walk with the Lord.\nIf that happens, we\u0026rsquo;re going to miss out on the riches of:\nScripture. All of Scripture, not just our favorite parts. The Church: All of the Church, not just our local church, now, but the global Church, throughout history. The Solution: The Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer HEAR ME, HEAR ME: Doing the Daily Office will NOT solve all of your spiritual problems. That\u0026rsquo;s not what I\u0026rsquo;m saying. For one thing, you need the ministry of the Holy Spirit. For another, you need baptismal and eucharistic communion with the people of God.\nHOWEVER, the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer is an ancient Christian (and, even before that, Jewish!) tradition that, I believe, can help us avoid the individualistic and consumeristic dangers of the Christian spirituality industrial complex.\nThe Daily Office is NOT just an Anglican thing. However, the Anglican tradition is one of several Christian traditions that have preserved the practice. And so it is something that the Anglian tradition can offer the entire Body of Christ.\nHere Are 5 Things that You Can Learn from the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer 1. Your Mornings and Evenings Belong to God Hopefully, you and I both know this already. Our entire day belongs to God!\nHowever, I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but I need regular reminders that time - all of it - is sacred. This is why I appreciate the Church Calendar, and it\u0026rsquo;s also why I appreciate the Daily Office. Beginning and ending each day with Scripture and prayer reminds me that the day and night in between prayer services belong to God.\nBy the way, the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer is not new, nor is it esoterically Anglican.\nAs Arthur Paul Boers noted in his 2001 Christianity Today piece, \u0026ldquo;The Rise and Fall of the Daily Office,\u0026rdquo;\nThe practice of daily, set prayer goes back to the Old Testament. The Psalms speak of prayer in the morning (5:3), early hours (130:6), evening (141:2), and day and night (92:2). Psalm 119:164a says, \u0026ldquo;Seven times a day I praise you.\u0026rdquo; Scripture also mentions thrice-daily prayers (Ps. 55:17, Dan. 6:10). Jews said the Shema (a Scripture-based prayer praising God\u0026rsquo;s greatness) two or three times a day.\nThe practice of the Daily Office or \u0026ldquo;fixed-hour prayer\u0026rdquo; developed from the Early Church through the Middle Ages, by which time it had developed into quite an elaborate monastic practice that was, by and large, inaccessible to the laity\nOne of many brilliant moves of Thomas Cranmer was to pare the medieval monastic hours of prayer down to the Daily Office of Matins (Morning Prayer) and Evensong (Evening Prayer) as it was included in the 1549 (and subsequent) Book of Common Prayer. Instead of learning Latin and praying 7 or 8 times a day, people could now pray twice a day in English, their native tongue.\n2. Your Walk With God is About More Than Just Your Emotions Growing up and into college, my \u0026ldquo;daily devotions,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;quiet time,\u0026rdquo; or the lack thereof frequently depended upon my emotions. When I felt super spiritual, maybe after a youth retreat or something, I was pretty regular in my daily devotions. However, as the emotional high faded, so did my daily quiet times.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I discovered the Daily Office in seminary that I realized just how beneficial a structured approach to Scripture and prayer was. Doing the Daily Office, even when I didn\u0026rsquo;t (and don\u0026rsquo;t) particularly feel like it is a good reminder that (1) God desires faithful obedience and (2) I am more than just my emotions.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s called the Daily \u0026ldquo;Office,\u0026rdquo; by the way, as in Daily \u0026ldquo;Duty\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Obligation.\u0026rdquo;\nWait, isn\u0026rsquo;t that legalism?? Well sure, your approach to the Daily Office can become legalistic. You can doggedly do it, even when you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it, thinking that doing so is somehow earning you more of God\u0026rsquo;s love and favor.\nBut you would be wrong!\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t obey God\u0026rsquo;s commands in order to earn God\u0026rsquo;s love. Rather, we obey God\u0026rsquo;s commands because we have already been shown God\u0026rsquo;s love! We are commanded, for example, to love one another. But, of course, we love because God first loved us! (See 1 John 4.)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing, though: For our own good, we still need to obey God, even when we don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it! Sure, there\u0026rsquo;s no explicit command in Scripture to \u0026ldquo;do the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer.\u0026rdquo; However, we are commanded to pray (and rejoice/give thanks, see 1 Thess. 5:16-18 for just one example). We are also commanded to heed God\u0026rsquo;s holy Word (see, for example, Josh. 1:8; Psalm 119; Matt. 4:4; 1 Tim. 4:13).\nSo, at the very least, the Daily Office gives us the opportunity to obey God\u0026rsquo;s commands - even when we don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it.\n3. Scripture and Prayer Are Your Daily Food Of course, Jesus said this best when he quoted Deuteronomy 8:3 in Matthew 4:4: “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”\nI have found that doing the Daily Office, even when I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly feel like it, is a helpful reminder that Scripture and prayer are my daily food.\nDo I remember exactly what I ate for breakfast last Wednesday? No.\nDo I know that I ate something? Yes. Did it help keep me alive that day? Yes.\nSimilarly: Do I remember exactly what I read and prayed during Morning Prayer last Wednesday? No.\nDo I know that I did Morning Prayer? Yes. Did it help to sustain and to shape me as a follower of Jesus Christ that day? Yes.\nSure, sometimes we will have moments of particular \u0026ldquo;transcendence\u0026rdquo; when reading the Bible and/or praying. However, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that Scripture and prayer are only meaningful to the extent that they feel meaningful. That would be like thinking a meal is only a good meal when it\u0026rsquo;s a steak dinner or something spectacular.\nScripture and prayer are meaningful, valuable, and necessary, even when they don\u0026rsquo;t feel particularly earth-shattering on any given morning or evening during the Daily Office.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s OK. Do the Daily Office and trust that God is sustaining and shaping you, even when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it.\n4. You Are Not Alone Doing the Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer is a great reminder that you are not alone when you\u0026rsquo;re reading the Bible and praying.\nIdeally, this should be a very visible and tangible reminder! We should do the Daily Office with other Christians whenever possible.\nHowever, even when you\u0026rsquo;re doing Morning or Evening Prayer \u0026ldquo;by yourself,\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s comforting to know that Christians around the world (and, on another level, throughout history) are doing Morning and Evening Prayer. You are praying with (and, hopefully, for) the global, historic Church of Jesus Christ!\n5. God Loves You, Even When You Can\u0026rsquo;t Get Your Act Together and Do the Daily Office! The Daily Office can be an encouragement - it can be good news - even when you fail to keep it!\nDoing the Daily Office ought to remind us that our acts of faithful obedience are both meaningful and frail.\nAfter all, it is so easy to forget or to skip Morning or Evening Prayer. It is so easy to fly through the prayers and the readings because we\u0026rsquo;re busy, tired, anxious, or all of the above. It is so easy to \u0026ldquo;fall short.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s OK! God still loves you!\nDon\u0026rsquo;t fall prey to the lie that, if you can\u0026rsquo;t do the Daily Office perfectly, you might as well not do it at all.\nNo! Not true! None of us does anything perfectly!\nYet, God still loves us. And he still wants what\u0026rsquo;s best for us.\nHe wants our faithful obedience, but, in the comforting words of Psalm 103:14, \u0026ldquo;he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, What Are You Waiting For?

Here are 3 reasons.\n1. Anglicanism as a Refuge from Fundamentalism First, for me, Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism. Now, to be sure, we do have our own fundamentalists within the Anglican Communion! But, compared to some \u0026ldquo;ingrown enclaves\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced in my Christian upbringing, Anglicanism has been a breath of fresh air. It has been an ecclesiological space for healing as I seek to \u0026quot; not throw the (gospel) baby out with the (fundamentalist) bathwater.\u0026quot;\nWhy/How?\n2. Anglicanism has Theological Breadth\u0026hellip; This goes hand-in-hand with my previous reason. Anglicanism has been a refuge from fundamentalism thanks in no small part to its \u0026ldquo;theological wiggle room.\u0026rdquo; The greatest strength of Anglicanism - and also the source of much of its angst - is its theological breadth. As a Ph.D. student in theology, I appreciate the fact that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like I\u0026rsquo;m walking along the edge of a knife, to the right or left of which my positions would quickly become verboten by the Anglican powers that be.\nInstead, it feels like I\u0026rsquo;m operating on a field of acceptable Anglican theological convictions/positions.\n3. \u0026hellip;Within a Tradition However, that \u0026ldquo;field\u0026rdquo; does have boundaries, for which I am grateful!\nAnd, for Anglicanism at its best, those boundaries largely coincide with the overarching tradition of the Christian Church as she has been sustained and guided by the Holy Spirit throughout the centuries.\nSo, on the one hand, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for some theological wiggle room, as it were. On the other hand, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;just me and my Bible\u0026rdquo; as if I had to try to figure everything out anew!\nThe same Spirit, whom I trust to illuminate my mind and heart as I read Scripture, has provided the Church with teachers and leaders throughout the ages. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the \u0026ldquo;tradition\u0026rdquo; should be adopted wholesale, unthinkingly, and uncritically - far from it! But, the traditions of the Church ought to be received humbly and prayerfully.\nSo, to sum up: I\u0026rsquo;m an Anglican Christian because, with its theological breadth within the overarching Christian tradition, Anglicanism has provided a salutary refuge for me from fundamentalism.\nWhy Are You an Anglican Christian? I could mention other reasons why I\u0026rsquo;m an Anglican Christian - such as the emphasis on the habitual rhythms of the Christian life (e.g., the Daily Office, the liturgical calendar, etc.).

Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how the Psalm opens:\nUnless the Lord builds the house,the builders labor in vain.Unless the Lord watches over the city,the guards stand watch in vain.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but it\u0026rsquo;s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.\nNot true! It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how hard you work. If the Lord is not behind it and in favor of it, you\u0026rsquo;ll be laboring in vain.\nNow, of course, this Psalm doesn\u0026rsquo;t undo the Bible other admonitions to work diligently, lest you fall into poverty (see my post about Poverty in the book of Proverbs).\nHowever, it does have implications for when we go to bed!\nGo to Sleep Verse 2 reads:\nIn vain you rise earlyand stay up late,toiling for food to eat—for he grants sleep to those he loves.\nThankfully, personal productivity advice these days has come around to recognizing the vital importance of sleep for your health.\nHowever, I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but I often feel the nagging temptation that, if only I could squeeze a few extra hours out of the day, I could turn things around. To be perfectly honest, this is one of the reasons why I try to get up early (~5:00am) most mornings.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with getting up early in the morning. After all, Jesus himself did so, in order to pray (see Mark 1:35).\nHowever, if you\u0026rsquo;re staying up late and getting up early in order to toil away because you think your work and success depends only on your efforts, then this Psalm encourages you to go to bed. Get some sleep. Learn to receive each day, along with exactly as much time as it contains, as a gift from God.\nHave Some Kids The second part of the Psalm hits close to home as well! (See my previous post: 3 Confessions of an Expectant Father.)\nVerses 3-5 read:\nChildren are a heritage from the Lord,offspring a reward from him.Like arrows in the hands of a warriorare children born in one’s youth.Blessed is the manwhose quiver is full of them.They will not be put to shamewhen they contend with their opponents in court.\nDISCLAIMER: I don\u0026rsquo;t have space here to address the complicated issue of infertility or other things that get in the way of having children. Just know that these verses don\u0026rsquo;t negate the fact that God loves and draws near to people going through such things in their times of pain.\nNevertheless, these verses also teach an important truth: children are a blessing from God.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I love kids. And, as I\u0026rsquo;ve said in my previous post, I\u0026rsquo;m excited to be a dad!\nAnd yet, I think that I\u0026rsquo;m going to need this Psalm as a frequent reminder in the days and years ahead! Personal productivity advice has come around to the idea of sleep being important, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know if there\u0026rsquo;s broad consensus on children always being considered a blessing! If you ask many people, the jury is still out on whether or not having children makes you happier - much less more productive!!\nReminders of Our Finitude So, I think this Psalm is a countercultural reminder that both sleep and children are good gifts from God.\nThey are BOTH reminders that we are finite creatures who cannot accomplish everything (or even anything meaningful) on our own. Instead, even though we are called to make the best use of our time, we are to receive each day as a gift from God - recognizing that, without his constant provision and sustenance, we would perish.\nSo, take heart! Go to bed a little earlier tonight! Everything doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on you.\nHow would your sleep habits and/or your plans for the future change if you took Psalm 127 to heart?

(Lord-willing and baby-waiting) we\u0026rsquo;ll both be in my sister-in-law\u0026rsquo;s wedding this Summer (I\u0026rsquo;m the officiant). And then? Then Lump makes his or her appearance!\n3 Confessions of an Expectant Father Anyways, this might be a bit self-serving, but amidst all the busyness, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d take a few minutes to write down some of my thoughts and feelings as I await the birth of my firstborn child.\n(I\u0026rsquo;ve been inspired to do this by reading the extremely helpful The Expectant Father: The Ultimate Guide for Dads-to-Be[affiliate link]. I highly recommend it to you if it\u0026rsquo;s relevant to your situation!)\nOK, here goes:\n1. I\u0026rsquo;m Anxious and Stressed I\u0026rsquo;m not necessarily putting this first because I feel it the strongest/most, but rather because I\u0026rsquo;m the most embarrassed by it!\nI\u0026rsquo;m anxious and stressed when it comes to my future as a parent, largely because the future has an annoying tendency to remain unknown! As a perfectionist - as a 1 on the Enneagram (check out The Road Back to You[affiliate link] if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what that means) - I don\u0026rsquo;t like such uncertainty.\nWhat if there are health complications with the pregnancy, delivery, or the baby? How will we navigate all of the complexities of parenting? What will our new schedule/life look like? How will we deal with the sleep deprivation?! Furthermore, something that\u0026rsquo;s weighing particularly heavy on me right now is: How will I provide for my family?\nRachel\u0026rsquo;s been earning the lion\u0026rsquo;s share of our income for the duration of our marriage, first as a Registered Nurse and now as a Family Nurse Practitioner. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that\u0026rsquo;s a bad thing, by the way. She\u0026rsquo;s crazy good at what she does, and her earning potential as an RN and FNP has been quite higher than mine as a seminarian and now a Ph.D. student!\nHowever, with a baby on the way, we\u0026rsquo;d like for Rachel to be able to stay at home as much as she would like to as soon as possible after the baby\u0026rsquo;s born. And, as a Ph.D. student who wants to become a pastor-theologian (check out The Pastor Theologian [affiliate link] if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what that means), my earning potential isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly skyrocketing right now.\nThis is forcing me to get creative and try to come up with ideas for an extra source(s) of income (\u0026ldquo;side hustles,\u0026rdquo; as they\u0026rsquo;re called - check out Side Hustle: From Idea to Income in 27 Days[affiliate link] to learn more). However, getting creative is hard work, of course!\nAnyways, there\u0026rsquo;s just a glimpse of my stress/anxiety.\nThankfully, that\u0026rsquo;s not all that\u0026rsquo;s on my mind and heart!\n2. I\u0026rsquo;m Thankful and Grateful First and foremost, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to God for providing the gift of a new life and entrusting it to our care.\nSecond, I\u0026rsquo;m thankful for my wife. Rachel is amazing. She\u0026rsquo;s going to be a fantastic mother, and there\u0026rsquo;s no one else I\u0026rsquo;d rather be a parent alongside!\nHowever, I have also experienced a recent spike in gratitude for my parents. It\u0026rsquo;s crazy to think that, about 27 years ago, my parents were in the exact same situation, and I was the firstborn child on the way, about to change their lives forever!\n27 years later, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been the recipient of countless acts of selfless love and generosity from Patrick and Donna Steele. I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly grateful for such loving and God-fearing parents (to say nothing of my loving and God-fearing in-laws!). I hope to pay the parenting gift forward, as it were, to the next generation.\n3. I\u0026rsquo;m Pumped and Excited Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m anxious. Sure, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful. But I\u0026rsquo;m also pumped! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to be a dad!\nRachel and I have always loved children. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a reputation as \u0026ldquo;The Baby Whisperer\u0026rdquo; in recent years (we\u0026rsquo;ll see how long that lasts).\nNow, we get to raise a child of our own!\nWill we desperately need the Lord\u0026rsquo;s help at every step of the way?

It\u0026rsquo;s not fully-formed by any means, but I\u0026rsquo;d like to get it out there and hear what you think of it.\nHere it is: \u0026ldquo;Mental Models\u0026rdquo; could be a helpful model for theology.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;mental model\u0026rdquo;? Definition of mental models Put simply, a \u0026ldquo;mental model\u0026rdquo; is a concept used to help explain how the world works.\nAccording to Wikipedia:\nA mental model is an explanation of someone\u0026rsquo;s thought process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person\u0026rsquo;s intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape behaviour and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal algorithm) and doing tasks.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a helpful video from Farnam Street explaining mental models (and giving an idea of how they\u0026rsquo;re usually appropriated these days for decision making and personal development):\nhttps://vimeo.com/177585900\nExamples of mental models For example, the 80/20 Principle (20% of causes lead to 80% of effects) and the Eisenhower Decision Matrix (organizing things by importance and urgency to prioritize decisions) could both be considered mental models.\nAnother famous mental model is Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor, the idea that the simplest hypothesis is preferable.\nOne of my personal favorite mental models is Hanlon\u0026rsquo;s Razor, the idea that one should \u0026ldquo;never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.\u0026rdquo;\n*Mental models are TRUE/USEFUL, but also LIMITED* This is, perhaps, the most important thing about mental models.\nOn the one hand, a mental model needs to be true and useful. It needs to accurately describe at least one thing about how the world works.\nHowever, on the other hand, a mental model is LIMITED. No single model can accurately account for the way the entire world works!\nSo, instead of clinging to one mental model and acting like it\u0026rsquo;s somehow comprehensive, you\u0026rsquo;re much better off developing a \u0026ldquo;toolbox\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;latticework\u0026rdquo; (to borrow Charlie Munger\u0026rsquo;s phrase) of mental models.\nExamples of theological mental models Theology is filled with statements and theories that, I think, work a lot like mental models. They are designed to accurately describe some aspect of theological reality. And yet, they are also limited. No single model/statement can account for everything about the person and work of the Triune God.\nFor one thing, many of the central themes of biblical theology [affiliate link] could be considered analogous to mental models.\nCovenants Divine Commands Atonement Servant of the Lord Day of the Lord People of God History of Redemption Atonement theories also tend to work much like mental models:\nRansom Theory Christus Victor Satisfaction Theory Moral Influence Theory Also, consider the following Trinitarian theological mental models:\nInseparable Operations: how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit relate to each other \u0026quot; Rahner\u0026rsquo;s Rule\u0026quot;: \u0026ldquo;the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the immanent Trinity is the economic Trinity\u0026rdquo; 4 Reasons why mental models might be useful for theology Again, here\u0026rsquo;s my idea: Mental models could provide a helpful model for theology. Why?\n1. Mental Models could help keep theologians humble Remember, mental models are true, but also limited. Such is also the case, I would argue, when it comes to theological claims.\nWhen we make a claim about who God is or what God has done, we are, in effect, proposing a theological Mental Model.\nIf the model is worthwhile, then it will be true. And we can test its truthfulness on the basis of Scripture (and tradition, reason, and experience - in that order of significance).\nHowever, no matter how worthwhile the model is, it will always be limited! It will never FULLY suffice to PERFECTLY describe the Truth with a capital T.\nTherefore, we should remain humble both when (1) proposing or (2) critiquing theological Mental Models.\n2. Mental models could help keep theologians creative. Because no single model can account for everything about the person and work of the Triune God, there is always more work to be done!\nNew models need to be proposed. Old models need to be critiqued, refined, and distilled.\nThis is why the theological conversation continues. We don\u0026rsquo;t just \u0026ldquo;arrive\u0026rdquo; at a list of correct theological positions. Instead, we delve deeper into the mysteries of God.\n3. Mental models could help introduce theology to others. Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, theology can be quite confusing. One could easily wonder what all the theological fuss is about. Theologians have been arguing with each other for thousands of years. Why haven\u0026rsquo;t we figured everything out yet?\nThinking of and presenting theology in terms of a latticework of theological models might be a helpful way forward, because it helps to make it clear why the theological enterprise is ongoing. It could also help people to evaluate and adopt various theological statements/positions on their own.\n4. Mental models could help us talk about the history of theology and the Church. This is, perhaps, a corollary of the previous point. The history of theology and the Church can be quite confusing. How are we supposed to keep track of all the different figures and theological statements?\nThinking of theology in terms of mental models might help to clarify the discussion a bit. This is already done in many areas of theology, especially when it comes to learning the different \u0026ldquo;theories\u0026rdquo; of the atonement.\nI think, however, that there\u0026rsquo;s room to expand the use of theological models throughout all of the different doctrines and figures in the history of theology. For example, when teaching someone about Martin Luther, we could emphasize an important \u0026ldquo;model\u0026rdquo; that Luther \u0026ldquo;discovered\u0026rdquo; - the distinction between passive and active righteousness.\nI realize that this is already being done, but perhaps there\u0026rsquo;s room to make \u0026ldquo;theological mental models\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;theological models\u0026rdquo;) more of a thoroughgoing model/framework for theology as a whole.\nWhat do you think? Are mental models as useful for theology as I think they are? Let me know in the comments below!

To give credit where credit is due: I heard them at Beeson Divinity School from Dr. Allen Ross. Also, a quick web search leads to this 2009 interview of Dr. Gerald Bray (also a Beeson professor!)\n1. What Does this Passage Teach Us About God? Who is God? What is God like? What has God done? Make a list of your observations. You\u0026rsquo;ll add to this as we go along.\n2. What Does this Passage Teach Us about Us Human Beings? As if the first question wasn\u0026rsquo;t broad enough, this question can feel overwhelmingly broad and vague. So, to add structure, here are two distinct things to focus on:\nWhat were we meant to be? How were we supposed to live? What has gone wrong? How has sin corrupted that original vision of what it means to be a human? Now, sometimes a passage will emphasize one of these things more than the other, but you should usually be able to extrapolate and answer both questions, regardless of what kind of passage you\u0026rsquo;re looking at.\nFor example, if a particular passage is emphasizing the fact that people lie all the time (answering the \u0026ldquo;What has gone wrong?\u0026rdquo; question), then you can extrapolate and answer the \u0026ldquo;What were we meant to be?\u0026rdquo; question: We were meant to tell the truth!\nAgain, make a list of your answers to these questions. Add it to your previous list of observations about God.\n3. What Does This Passage Teach Us About How We Are Supposed to Respond to God? OK, here\u0026rsquo;s where the rubber meets the road. But, again, this question can feel pretty vague/broad, so here are sub-questions to add structure:\nWhat has God done to address what has gone wrong? What does God expect of us in light of this? Ideally, you should be able to use your answers to the first two questions to help you answer this third question.\nSometimes, however, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that the passage itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly say much about this third question. In that case, it is legitimate to extrapolate based on the rest of the Bible.\nThat is, say your passage doesn\u0026rsquo;t mention Jesus, but Jesus is in fact how God has addressed the human problem in your passage (protip: this is VERY OFTEN the case!) It\u0026rsquo;s legitimate to think and take some notes about how God\u0026rsquo;s entire mission of redemption and salvation addressed the particular sin problem that your passage focuses on.\nTake care when doing so, however! This is why it\u0026rsquo;s so important to know the entirety of the Good Story of God as found in Scripture.

The time between the apostles and their own day is one giant blank. That is hardly what God had in mind\u0026rdquo; (xi). Shelley wrote this book to address this problem.\nNow, in seminary, I had to take a \u0026ldquo;History \u0026amp; Doctrine\u0026rdquo; sequence of 4 courses that covered the Patristic era through 20th-century Church history and theology. It was amazing, but who\u0026rsquo;s got that kind of time, right?! So, I asked around, including some of my former college and seminary theology profs, searching for the best, accessible, single-volume overview of the history of the Christian Church.\nThis book received the most votes by far. And I can see why.\nShelley\u0026rsquo;s book (also now in its fourth edition, which is a good sign!) manages to cover from the time of Jesus to the present day in approximately 500 pages. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a long book, but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to cover! If you read this book, you\u0026rsquo;ll go through:\nThe Age of Jesus and the Apostles (6BC - AD 70) The Age of Catholic Christianity (70-312) The Age of the Christian Roman Empire (312-590) The Christian Middle Ages (590-1517) The Age of the Reformation (1517-1648) The Age of Reason and Revival (1648-1789) The Age of Progress (1789-1914) The Age of Ideologies (1914-1989) The Age of Global Expansion and Relocation (1900 \u0026ndash; ) Again, I know of no better place to start to learn about the history of the Church if you\u0026rsquo;re crunched for time. Again: take up and read!\n4. Thomas Oden, Classic Christianity: A Systematic Theology OK, so we\u0026rsquo;ve covered (1) The Bible, (2) how to read it, and (3) Church history. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time for the best, accessible, single-volume introduction to Christian theology.\nThis was harder to narrow down. After all, there are plenty of introductions to theology and systematic (think \u0026ldquo;a comprehensive system\u0026rdquo;) theologies out there. What makes one better than any of the others?\nWell, as far as I know, Oden\u0026rsquo;s book is different than any other systematic theology out there because he gives you a \u0026ldquo;consensus view of the Christian faith.\u0026rdquo; That is, instead of giving you his particular take on Christian theology, he\u0026rsquo;s attempting to give you the Christian theology upon which there was widespread agreement throughout the first 15 or so centuries of Church history.\nThe inside cover of the book claims that it \u0026ldquo;provides the best synthesis of the whole history of Christian thought.\u0026rdquo; Even though that\u0026rsquo;s a bold claim, I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to believe it, based upon the systematic theologies I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered in my academic research.\nI strongly recommend you buy and read Oden, obviously. However, if, for some reason, Oden seems too long or expensive, check out Alister McGrath\u0026rsquo;s Theology: The Basics or Daniel Migliore\u0026rsquo;s Faith Seeking Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Theology (Third Edition).\n5. Matthew Perman, What\u0026rsquo;s Best Next: How the Gospel Transforms the Way You Get Things Done OK, last book of my top 5! And it\u0026rsquo;s a good one. In fact, this is the single best book on productivity and time management for Christians that I know of. It got me started on my kick of reading productivity books for the past few years, and I trust that it will help you create more margin in your life to pursue purpose and meaning.\nPerman begins the book with an argument for why we need a uniquely Christian view of productivity. From there, he covers:\nMaking God Supreme in Our Productivity Gospel-Driven Productivity: A New Way to Look at Getting Things Done D.A.R.E. Define: Know What\u0026rsquo;s Most Important Architect: Create a Flexible Structure Reduce: Free Up Your Time for What\u0026rsquo;s Most Important Execute: Do What\u0026rsquo;s Most Important Living This Out This is a profoundly useful and useable book! As a productivity guru, Perman naturally ends each chapter with what he calls \u0026ldquo;The Box\u0026rdquo; - a summary section containing the core point and core passage of the chapter, further resources, and suggestions for immediate application.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a 500 word summary of the book at the end, followed by a helpful topical index and suggestions for further reading - including some of the \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; works in productivity and time management which, if you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to track down!\nIf you want to become more productive and manage your time better for the glory of Jesus Christ, buy and read Perman\u0026rsquo;s book.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/5-books-every-christian-read/","summary":"OK, OK.

That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve made \u0026quot; Get Your Act Together (Productivity and Time Management)\u0026quot; the first of my Steps to Find Purpose and Meaning in Life.\nThankfully, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve found something that can help. I\u0026rsquo;d like to introduce you to the \u0026quot; Pareto Principle,\u0026quot; also known as \u0026quot; the 80/20 Rule,\u0026quot; the \u0026ldquo;law of the vital few,\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;principle of factor sparsity,\u0026rdquo; if you want to get all technical about it.\nPut as simply as possible, the 80/20 rule says this: 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Take a moment to think about this, and it becomes obvious that the 80/20 principle is at play all over the place.\nHave you ever heard someone say that 80% of the money/work in a church comes from just 20% of the congregation? 80% of sales come from 20% of clients? As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t get hung up on exact percentages and allow the principle to be a ballpark estimator/lens, you can see the Pareto Principle at work in several different areas of life, from agriculture to economics.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a helpful video if you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about the 80/20 Rule:\n\u0026amp;t=51s\nPerforming an \u0026ldquo;80/20 Analysis\u0026rdquo; = Determining which 20% of things are responsible for 80% of the results. This works both positively and negatively. Right? 20% of the people you spend time with are responsible for 80% of the positive emotions and experiences. But 20% of the people you spend time with are also responsible for 80% of the negative emotions in your life.\n20% of the things you spend your time doing are responsible for 80% of the outcomes - both positively and negatively.\nThis means that you can make some pretty drastic changes in your life by zeroing in on the correct 20%! Eliminating the bad 20% and focusing on increasing the good 20% can quickly turn your life around.\nDoing an 80/20 analysis in various areas of your life can save you a bunch of time, because you\u0026rsquo;re maximizing your efforts by prioritizing the changes you make.\nThe 80/20 Rule is, therefore, understandably a pretty popular concept. (Google \u0026ldquo;80/20 Rule\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;ll see what I mean!) If you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about it, consider picking up Richard Koch\u0026rsquo;s classic book, The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less. (Heads up: that\u0026rsquo;s an affiliate link. If you end up buying that book, I earn a small commission, at no extra cost to you.)\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that there are two reasons why Christians in particular should care about the 80/20 Principle.\n2 Reasons Why Christians Should Care about the 80/20 Pareto Principle 1. It could be deadly to your Christian life. That\u0026rsquo;s right, I think that, if it\u0026rsquo;s misused, the Pareto Principle can be deadly for your walk with God.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing, if you allow \u0026ldquo;the world\u0026rdquo; to calibrate your 80/20 analysis, then you will end up frequently overlooking the things that God cares about \u0026ndash; the things that God wants YOU to care about.\nDo you think that loving your enemies, caring for the poor, turning the other cheek, and loving the unlovely are going to show up at the top of your 80/20 analysis if you\u0026rsquo;re not allowing your head and your heart to be shaped by the gospel - by the Good Story of God? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so.\nSo, Christians should care about the 80/20 Rule because, if we use it incorrectly, it might end up making us less effective for the Kingdom of God.\n2. It could change your Christian life for the better. However, just because a principle can be misused doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should use it!\n(Also, technically, the Pareto Principle is at work, even if you\u0026rsquo;re not choosing to capitalize on it! So, there\u0026rsquo;s no sense in ignoring it!)\nAs long as we allow our perspectives to be shaped by the Gospel, Christians can profitably use the 80/20 Principle to become more effective, healthy, and whole for the Kingdom of God. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason not to use this tool.\nPerforming an 80/20 Analysis on Your Christian Life Take advantage of the Pareto Principle by applying it to your walk with God. Think about it with me:\nWhat 20% of People, Things, and Habits are Drawing You 80% Farther Away from God? What people/places/things/actions are responsible for the vast majority of your spiritual decline?\nIs it your phone? Social media? Pornography? An old friend who is clearly influencing you more in a negative direction than you\u0026rsquo;re influencing them in a positive direction?\nYou need to prioritize your time, your efforts, and your prayers to decreasing these things. Even taking just one of these \u0026ldquo;worst offenders\u0026rdquo; out of your life could make a huge difference.\nWhat 20% of People, Things, and Habits are Drawing You 80% Closer to God? What people/places/things/actions are responsible for the vast majority of your spiritual growth?\nIs it going to church regularly? Getting up early to read your Bible and pray? Finding and spending time with a trusted spiritual mentor?\nYou need to prioritize your time, your efforts, and your prayers to increasing these things. Doing so will have an outsized impact on your spiritual life.\nRemember, YOU Can\u0026rsquo;t Do This Alone No, of course, we can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;fix ourselves\u0026rdquo; on our own!\nWe desperately need the life-transforming ministry of the Holy Spirit to make these kinds of changes in our lives. And God doesn\u0026rsquo;t love us based on how well we do an 80/20 analysis (praise God!).\nBut still, it helps to have a clearer idea of where to focus in terms of having a closer relationship with God and others. And I believe that the 80/20 Rule can help us get more clarity.\nComing Soon: An 80/20 Approach to Productivity, Time Management, Bible Study, and Theology There\u0026rsquo;s another reason why I\u0026rsquo;m bringing up the 80/20 Rule. This principle will guide my future posts about\nProductivity Time Management Bible Study Theology Why? Because I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced that anyone needs to learn 100% or even 80% about these topics before they move forward. Attempting to do so will frequently lead to paralysis and indecision, instead of growth.\nInstead, it pays off to begin with the most effective 20% of the information in each topic area. And that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on in the weeks ahead.\nGot Questions? I\u0026rsquo;d love to help you brainstorm how the 80/20 Principle could make a difference in your Christian life.

Dev. Joshua P. Steele"},{"content":"INTRODUCTION Theological hermeneutics – human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God – faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?\nIn what follows, I propose that we can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture’s theological location regarding its subject matter – the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself.\nIn the first section, I will argue that the Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture’s role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God’s people. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God’s people, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.\nOnce we clarify the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic.\nIn the second section, therefore, I maintain that, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads: the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. My approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. Nevertheless, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of all authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.\nFinally, in the third section, I offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology.

The relationship between biblical and theological studies: Should they be one discipline, or two (or more)? Potential Way Forward: Situating Scripture theologically, regarding its subject matter Scripture’s Theological Location Scripture’s subject matter: The story to which it bears witness God’s identity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit God’s acts: Creation Fall Redemption Israel Jesus Church Consummation Scripture’s role in the story to which it bears witness Scripture and God: Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of God, used by God to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. Scripture and Creation: Because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain of creation outside of its purview. Scripture and God’s People: Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological. Theological Hermeneutics: Both Special and General Because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within the story of its subject matter, theological hermeneutics is a special hermeneutic. Because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, theological hermeneutics is a general/universal hermeneutic. Implications for the hermeneutical triads (General: author/text/reader; Special: historical/literary/theological) Theology is given pride of place in both triads. The divine author, Christ-centered text, and Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. Nevertheless, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of all authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture. Biblical and Theological Studies: A Multifaceted Discipline Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. Complex: the need for biblical studies and biblical theology Unified and Ecclesiological: the need for theological studies and the theological interpretation of Scripture Because the Church’s understanding of and participation within Scripture’s subject matter is complex, the theological sub-disciplines need each other. Historically complex: the need for historical theology Conceptually complex: the need for systematic theology Practically complex (as well as salutary and aretegenic): the need for pastoral theology Although a division of labor is acceptable on pragmatic grounds (due to the complexity of Scripture’s subject matter), the unity of the subject matter demands a unified discipline. Conclusion SCRIPTURE’S THEOLOGICAL LOCATION The admittedly diverse texts that make up the Old and New Testaments of Christian Scripture bear witness to a single unified narrative – a sequence of events with its own dramatic coherence and sense – of the triune God’s creation and redemption of the world. [1] Crucially, Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture’s authoritative role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God’s people.\n(Note: For a related account of Scripture, read my previous essay: Scripture: What It Is and Why It Matters.)\nScripture’s Subject Matter: The Story to Which It Bears Witness What is the story to which Scripture bears witness? It is the story of the identity and acts of God.\nRegarding God’s identity, Scripture bears witness to the fact that God is triune. Granted, a common objection to the doctrine of the Trinity is the claim that it nowhere appears in the pages of Scripture. And indeed, despite the favorite trinitarian “proof-texts” in which Father, Son, and Spirit appear together, “no doctrine of the Trinity in the Nicene sense is present in [even] the New Testament.” [2]\nHowever, as Jenson persuasively argues, “the doctrine of the Trinity is indeed in Scripture, if one abandons modernity\u0026rsquo;s notion that statement in so many words as formulated is the only way that a doctrine can appear there.” [3] Instead, the narrative of Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.” [4] These three dramatis personae Dei, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a persona in Israel\u0026rsquo;s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.” [5]\nYHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the Father by virtue of Jesus\u0026rsquo; address of him as such. [6] The Son is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address, but also in light of passages such as Psalm 2, appropriated in Hebrews 1 to identify Jesus as the divine Son. [7] Finally, the Spirit appears as a persona of the story, first in the Old Testament as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the New Testament as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church. [8]\nTo say the very least, the classical formulation of the Trinity did not arise from a scriptural vacuum. So much for Scripture’s witness to the triune identity of God.\nRegarding God’s acts, Scripture bears witness to the narrative of God’s creation and redemption of a people unto perfect fellowship with himself. Admittedly, there are ways of improving upon the common “creation – fall – redemption – consummation” framework for summarizing the story or “theo-drama” to which Scripture bears witness. [9] However, as long as it is emphasized that redemption includes Israel, Jesus, and the Church, I think that this four-part framework is sufficient for our purposes.\nAt creation, God extends the fellowship he has eternally enjoyed as Trinity outward to that which is not God, especially to human beings, his “image-bearers,” who were to extend his rule and reign throughout creation (Gen. 1-2). However, at the fall, humans reject both the Creator and their creaturely vocation, rupturing fellowship between God and humanity, between humanity and itself, and between humanity and the rest of creation (Gen. 3).\nNevertheless, God does not abandon creation to exile and decay, but rather redeems it. God calls Abraham and the nation of Israel back to unity with himself through covenant. He endeavors to pull them – and through them as a priestly nation, the world – back from the ruptured relationships into covenantal fellowship and oneness. [10] However, the faithless Israelites repeatedly eschew the loving faithfulness of their God, leading to the exile of the nation. [11]\nAt the incarnation, the Trinity stretches through the Son to meet all humanity – as a Jewish man in the midst of Israel – in its state of partial exile, to fulfill the global mission of Israel. [12] As God enters our midst as Jesus Christ, he pushes us to the side in our perverted attempts to secure our own existence. Without succumbing to sin’s siren call, he is fully affected by it, bringing sinful human nature into the life of God and thereby intensifying the divine reaction against it into an ultimate tension. The one ultimately worthy to exile is now also the one ultimately worthy of exile.\nAt the cross, the Trinity stretches to the utmost, as the Son of God, worthy to mete out the sentence of exile, instead goes into exile – into the far country of the grave – bearing the consequences of sin for the sake of humanity’s salvation.\nAt the death of Christ, the Trinity has stretched to its limit, and yet humanity is left in a state of partial exile as before. However, through the power of the Holy Spirit, the exiled Son of God is vindicated as the Savior of the world and brought back from the far country of death.\nThrough this movement of the Son into the utmost exile and back again, sin itself is offered up to destruction. And crucially, all humanity who is united to him by grace through faith – everyone who is therefore in Christ – gets caught up with the Son in his return to the eternal life and love of the Triune God. [13]\nScripture’s Role in the Story to Which It Bears Witness Having summarized the story to which Scripture bears witness, we now turn to Scripture’s authoritative role in the story. What authority does Scripture have in the story, and what function/role does it play? I will attempt to answer these questions by explaining the relationships between (1) Scripture and God, (2) Scripture and creation, and (3) Scripture and God’s people, the Church.\nScripture and God With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. But what does it mean for Scripture to be inspired by God? I agree with Henry’s definition of inspiration as “a supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on divinely chosen agents in consequence of which their writings become trustworthy and authoritative.” [14] However, I would add that the writings are specifically trustworthy and authoritative toward the divine ends of revelation and redemption. That is, God inspires human authors to communicate his word to human audiences for the sake of fellowship and communion with them.\nThe authority of Scripture, then, rests in its divine provenance. As Webster rightly states, “Scripture is authoritative because it is instrumental in bringing the word of God to bear upon the thought and practices of the church.” [15] Or, as Vanhoozer summarizes it, “the Bible not only reports the word of God but is itself a form of the divine address.” [16] In this way, the triune God makes himself verbally present to his creatures through Holy Scripture. The Bible, therefore, plays an authoritative role in the story to which it bears witness, because it is God’s own witness to his own identity and acts.\nScripture and Creation With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. I will have more to say about this below (see “Theological Hermeneutics: Both Special and General”). For now, it is enough to note that it is impossible to take up a perspective completely outside of the story to which Scripture bears witness, for the story encompasses all created space and time, as well as their origins and ends. Though Scripture plays a distinct role in the story, as opposed to other created realities, whether trees or thermodynamics, it is inherently related to the rest of creation – especially to God’s people.\nScripture and God’s People The story of Scripture includes and is intertwined with the story of God’s people, beginning with the story of Israel, and then, through Jesus the Messiah, the culmination of Israel’s story, continuing into the story of the Church. [17] For this reason, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.\nWhile certain accounts of the canonization of Scripture make it sound like the Church (rather arbitrarily) selected certain texts and deemed them authoritative, theologically-speaking, it is the other way around. As Webster rightly maintains, “the process of canonization is properly to be understood, not as an act in which the church creates an authority for itself by determining a set of normative texts, but as an act of acknowledging antecedent authority imposed upon the church from without.” [18] In fact, although the Church undoubtedly had a role to play in the canonization of Scripture (just as human authors had a role to play in the writing of Scripture), Scripture, as God’s word, creates and sustains the Church. [19]\nI agree with Watson’s claim that Gadamer’s concept of Wirkungsgeschichte is theologically helpful in describing the relationship between Scripture and Church. The Church can be viewed as the Wirkungsgeschichte– the “effective-history” – of Scripture. The text of Scripture exerts initiatory agency on the Church, and the Church exerts responsive agency on Scripture. [20] Of course, the Gadamerian concept on its own does not replace the necessary constant guidance of the interaction between Church and Scripture by the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, it can help to clarify how this interaction takes place.\nIn summary, Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. It is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. Furthermore, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And finally, Scripture is irreducibly ecclesiological.\nTHEOLOGICAL HERMENEUTICS: SPECIAL AND GENERAL Having clarified the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic. To the first relationship we now turn. Properly understood, theological hermeneutics is both a special and a general hermeneutic. [21]\nBecause Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within the story of its subject matter, theological hermeneutics is a special hermeneutic. That is, we do not read Scripture exactly like any other book, because Scripture is unlike all other books to the extent that it is the inspired and authoritative word of the triune God, used to reveal himself and redeem his people unto fellowship with himself. Given the explicitly theological subject matter of Scripture, it is ill-advised to attempt to shoehorn Scripture into a general hermeneutic that is designed to work apart from a theological perspective. Although some may accuse such an explicitly theological approach as “special pleading,” I maintain that a special, theological hermeneutic of Scripture is necessary to interpret Scripture according to its subject matter.\nDoes this mean, then, that theological hermeneutics becomes a ghettoized discipline? Not necessarily. Because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, theological hermeneutics is also a general/universal hermeneutic. Indeed, it will only appear like a disciplinary ghetto to the extent that one has not yet been shaped by Scripture’s subject matter.\nI am in agreement with Jenson’s claim that “we read the relation between the strange world the Bible opens and our familiar world the wrong way around, and so are in a hopeless situation from the start.” [22] He continues: “When the Bible lacks force in the church,” (and, I would add, in the academy!), “it is regularly — from the time of the apostles to post-Christendom — because we presume that the ‘real’ world is some other world than the one that opens in the Bible, and that what we have to do is figure out how to make the Bible effective in the putatively ‘real’ world.” This is an ill-fated enterprise, for “the Bible is in fact ineffective and irrelevant in our so-called ‘real’ world, because the Bible does not acknowledge that our ‘real’ world deserves the adjective.” [23]\nBecause the story to which Scripture bears witness is the story of the real world, theological hermeneutics is a general and universal hermeneutic.\nImplications for the Hermeneutical Triads This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads, the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis.\nMy approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance, for they determine how we ought to interpret everything else, including historical and literary analysis, as well as all other authors, texts, and readers.\nDoes this mean, then, that theology dominates all other disciplines? Will we quickly find ourselves insisting upon a puritanical regulative principle as the standard of human knowledge, rejecting claims to knowledge of anything – whether physical quarks or human quirks – not mentioned in the pages of the Bible?\nNo, not necessarily. For, although I maintain that theology is, as it were, the queen of the sciences, she is a kindly ruler. That is, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of all authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.\nFurthermore, plenty of Scriptural teaching would seem to suggest that theological “insiders” must remain intellectually humble, open to the possibility that theological “outsiders,” whether methodological naturalists or adherents of other religions, might have much to teach them about the world. [24] As Treier notes, “often non-Christian interpreters will understand – that is, develop various capacities for communicative action in relation to – texts far better than Christians will.” [25] This takes nothing away from the authority or scope of Scripture or its subject matter.\nTherefore, although some readers may object to the extent to which I am willing to give theology explicit priority over all other disciplines of human understanding, I would answer that doing so actually ends up requiring and resourcing other intellectual disciplines better (from a theological perspective, at least) than they could do so on their own.\nIn sum, then, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. What does this mean for the relationship between biblical and theological studies? Should they be one discipline or two (or more)?\nBIBLICAL AND THEOLOGICAL STUDIES: A MULTIFACETED DISCIPLINE Given the enormity and the importance of Scripture’s subject matter, I here offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.\nBiblical and Theological Studies Need Each Other Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. In many churchly circles, this assertion would not be met with much resistance. However, in the (modern) academy, biblical and theological studies have been kept increasingly separate. Since the academy is the sphere in which biblical and(/or) theological studies is/are located as (an) academic discipline/s (see how confusing this gets?), we must reckon with the academic division.\nIn their survey of the “original unity and subsequent separation” of biblical studies and systematic theology, Rowe and Hays helpfully observe that the separation of the two disciplines is a relatively recent phenomenon. [26] Indeed, they (approximately) trace the modern division to the eighteenth century, paradigmatically to J.P. Gabler’s 1787 inaugural address regarding the distinction between biblical and dogmatic theology. [27] Broadly speaking, in Gabler’s wake, biblical and theological studies have, at worst, ignored each other’s contributions entirely and, at best, functioned as a sort of disciplinary layer-cake, with the results of each discipline being transmitted to the other for separate and subsequent handling.\nIs this “layer-cake approach” the best we can hope for? I do not think so. To do justice to their complex, unified, and ecclesiological subject matter, both biblical and theological studies need each other at all stages of the various processes involved in their subdisciplines.\nOn the biblical studies side of that relationship, I believe that the focus ought to be on the complexity of the Bible’s subject matter. As Rowe and Hayes maintain, the arguments in favor of “the implicit unity between biblical studies and systematic theology…do not preclude an emphasis within biblical studies on the distinctiveness and particularity of the diverse texts [of Scripture].” [28] If, as Jenson has suggested, the ultimate test for theology – in both its individual statements and its comprehensive systems – is its success or failure as a hermeneutic for all of Scripture, then one of the tasks of biblical studies is, as it were, to remind theological studies just how difficult of a test it faces, due to the historical and literary complexities of the Bible! [29]\nHowever, on the other hand, theology is required to remind biblical studies that, thought the biblical texts be admittedly varied, they bear witness to a unified and irreducibly ecclesiological narrative, held together by the story’s author and central character, the triune God. After all, even the moniker “biblical” studies, as opposed to, say, “Ancient Near Eastern” or “Greco-Roman” studies, implies “the theological decision that the particular documents that constitute the Bible are in some way related to one another, as distinct from their relation to other pieces of literature, and are therefore to be treated together.” (Though, as Rowe and Hays also note, this does not settle the question of how biblical texts relate to one another.) [30]\nImplications for Biblical Theology and the Theological Interpretation of Scripture This seems like the best time to address the contested and contentious fields of biblical theology [BT] and the theological interpretation of Scripture [TIS]. While I do not have much to add to the ongoing discussion that has taken place between, among others, Bockmuehl, Fowl, Klink and Lockett, and Treier, I do think that conceiving biblical and theological studies as a single, multifaceted discipline adds plausibility to Treier’s “middle way” or “Type 3” approach to relating the two disciplines in a distinct-yet-complementary way. [31]\nAlthough I do not claim that this is the only right way to define BT, I admit that I am predisposed to think of the sub-discipline in terms of what Klink and Lockett call the “BT2: History of Redemption” approach, as practiced by, among many others, D.A. Carson. [32] Thus construed, BT’s goal is\nto discern the historical progression of God’s work of redemption through an inductive analysis of key themes developing through both discrete corpora and the whole of Scripture. Major themes such as covenant or kingdom constitute the theological connecting fibers between the Old and New Testaments, and these themes necessarily run along a historical trajectory, giving fundamental structure to the theology of the Bible. [33]\nFurthermore, although I readily admit the difficulties involved in defining TIS, the main difference that seems to emerge between BT (thus construed) and TIS is the latter’s willingness to read the Bible (1) following the example of certain “pre-critical” exegetes, (2) through the creedal lens of the “Rule of Faith,” and (3) within the interpretive community of the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. [34]\nI think that BT and TIS can benefit each other as they seek to deal with the subject matter of Scripture.\nWithout accepting BT’s (occasionally) a-ecclesiological presuppositions, TIS could benefit from BT’s close reading of biblical texts in order to demonstrate the Bible’s coherence on its own terms. How? First, as evidence that churchly interpreters of Scripture, including so-called pre-critical ones, were not wrong to see a unity in Scripture and its subject matter. Second, the various “key themes” of Scripture that BT isolates can provide TIS with profitable areas for further theological research.\nOn the other hand, BT could use TIS as a reminder that (1) Scripture itself, and not BT’s synthesis of it, is theologically authoritative and that (2) the Bible does not need to be interpreted exclusively on “its own terms,” for the story to which Scripture bears witness extends beyond the Old and New Testaments to incorporate the story of the Church and the rest of creation.\nThis may not result in a radical change within BT’s or TIS’s explicit methods (or, perhaps in the case of the latter, the lack thereof), but it would hopefully at least result in greater disciplinary humility and appreciation for (1) the theological authority of Scripture itself, apart from either BT’s or TIS’s elucidations of it, and (2) the Holy Spirit’s role(s) in inspiration, preservation, and interpretation of Scripture throughout the history of the Church.\nTheological Subdisciplines Need Each Other If biblical and theological studies ought to be a single, multifaceted discipline, how should we construe the relationships between the various theological sub-disciplines?\nAs Jenson claims, if theology asks (with) the Church: “Wherein was what we heard and saw the gospel?” and “What are we tomorrow to say and enact in order to say and enact this same gospel?”, then historical theology focuses on the former question and normative theology (which encompasses both systematic and pastoral theology) focuses on the latter. [35] Jenson continues to distinguish between pastoral theology, which focuses on “the exigencies of the church’s daily task,” and systematic theology, which “takes up questions posed not only by current urgency but also by perceived inherent connections of the faith.” [36] And yet, because of the historical way in which both the Church’s exigencies and the faith’s inherent connections have developed, at some point these distinctions perhaps begin to lose their importance.\nNevertheless, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the various theological sub-disciplines need each other as well.\nThe historical complexity speaks to the need for historical theology, and the conceptual complexity to the need for systematic theology. The relationship between these two sub-disciplines ought to be much the same as that between biblical and theological studies. That is, historical theology, as it were, can remind systematic theology of the historical particularities and complexities involved in attempting to understand, with the Church, the subject matter of Scripture. Systematic theology can remind historical theology of the complex conceptual unity involved in the task, such that, for example, Augustine and Barth can be put into conversation with one another (regarding a variety of theological loci) without doing undue violence to either.\nWhat role does pastoral theology play? Both historical and systematic theology must be reminded that the subject matter of Scripture is an all-encompassing story, one in which we all cannot help but participate. Furthermore, as Charry is right to note, theology is properly salutary and “aretegenic” (“virtue-producing”) – and not merely cognitive – for God reveals and redeems for the sake of human flourishing. [37] Pastoral theology, therefore, asks the crucial question: Given our current situation, how do we participate rightly in the all-encompassing story of the triune God? It thereby prevents historical and systematic theology from losing purchase on their subject matter by forgetting that it matters for life as we now live it.\nCONCLUSION/SUMMARY Regarding the enterprise of theological hermeneutics, I have argued that we can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture’s theological authoritative location/role regarding its subject matter – the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God’s people, Scripture is irreducibly ecclesiological.\nBecause Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This means that theology is to be given pride of place in both the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, as well as the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. And yet, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of all authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.\nFinally, I have argued that, given the enormity and importance of Scripture’s subject matter, we ought to conceive of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology – as well as biblical theology and the theological interpretation of Scripture. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.\n===NOTES=== [1] Or, as Vanhoozer puts it, “the subject matter of the Bible, and hence of Christian faith and thought, is intrinsically dramatic.” Kevin J. Vanhoozer, “A Drama-of-Redemption Model: Always Performing?,” in Four Views on Moving Beyond the Bible to Theology, ed. Gary T. Meadors, Counterpoints: Bible \u0026amp; Theology (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2009), 155. Indeed, as will be seen throughout this paper, I am heavily indebted to Vanhoozer’s “theodrama” model.\n[2] Rusch notes that the binitarian NT formulas are: Rom. 8:11; 2 Cor. 4:1; Gal. 1:1; Eph. 1:20; 1 Tim. 1:2; 1 Pet. 1:21; and 2 John 1:13. The trinitarian NT formulas are: Matt 28:19; 1 Cor. 6:11; 12:4ff.; Gal. 3:11-14; Heb. 10:29; 1 Pet. 1:2. William G. Rusch, ed., The Trinitarian Controversy, Sources of Early Christian Thought (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress, 1980), 2. Without denying the importance of such passages, Jenson rightly laments those who “scrabble around in the Bible for bits and pieces of language to cobble together into a sort of Trinity-doctrine – usually with intellectually lamentable and indeed sometimes heretical results.” Robert W. Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” Concordia Theological Quarterly 68, no. 3–4 (2004): 196.\n[3] Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” 197. Emphasis original. Also, for a similar argument to Jenson’s, which focuses on the text of Philippians 2, see David S. Yeago, “The New Testament and the Nicene Dogma: A Contribution to the Recovery of Theological Exegesis,” Pro Ecclesia 3, no. 2 (1994): 152–64.\n[4] Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” 199. The divinity of the Father is perhaps the easiest to note throughout the Bible. On the divinity of the Son, see: John 1, 10; Col. 2; Phil. 2; and Heb. 1. On the divinity of the Spirit, see: 1 Cor. 2:11; Heb. 3:7-10; and 10:15-17. I have here stuck to the contours of Jenson’s argument in lieu of the common arguments for the divinity of Son and Spirit, e.g.\n[5] Jenson, 198–202. The phrase “ dramatis personae Dei” is Jenson\u0026rsquo;s adaptation of Tertullian\u0026rsquo;s verbiage.\n[6] Cf. John 5:16-23; Jenson, 199. Although this could perhaps be oversimplification, cf. Marshall\u0026rsquo;s claim that “the Father is the God of Israel, the Son is the God of Israel, and the Holy Spirit is the God of Israel, yet they are not three Gods of Israel, but one God of Israel.” B. Marshall, “Do Christians Worship the God of Israel” in Knowing the Triune God (ed. J. Buckley and D. Yeago; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001), 258; quoted by Geoffrey Wainwright, “Trinity,” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible, ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 817. Nevertheless, Jenson\u0026rsquo;s main point still stands, by virtue of Jesus\u0026rsquo; address to the Father establishing both Fatherhood and Sonship within the Trinity.\n[7] Cf. Ps. 2:7; Heb. 1:1-14. In addition, Jenson focuses on showing the presence of the Trinity in the OT, where it is so often neglected, by positing that the Son shows up via the themes of the angel of the Lord, the name of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord. Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” 200–203.\n[8] Jenson, 199, 204; cf. Gen. 1:2; Ps. 51:11; Isa. 11:2; Ezek. 37:1-14; John 14:15-31; Acts 1:7-8; 2:1-41; Rom. 1:4; 8:11.\n[9] “Theo-drama” is a term borrowed from Hans Urs von Balthasar by Kevin Vanhoozer, who approvingly mentions N.T. Wright’s “five-act” framework (creation, fall, Israel, Christ, church), despite preferring the following slightly-modified framework: (1) creation, (2) election of Israel, (3) Christ, (4) Pentecost and the church, (5) consummation. See Vanhoozer, “A Drama-of-Redemption Model: Always Performing?,” 174. Samuel Wells prefers: (1) creation, (2) Israel, (3) Jesus, (4) church, (5) eschaton. See Samuel Wells, Improvisation: The Drama of Christian Ethics (Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, 2004), 53.\n[10] See foundational covenant passages, such as Gen. 12, 15, throughout the Old Testament.\n[11] Consider, for example, the curses for covenantal unfaithfulness found in Deut. 27:14-26; 28:15-68, culminating with the threat of exile.\n[12] As Irenaeus and Athanasius proclaimed: “God became what we are so that we might become what He is.”\n[13] Cf. 1 Cor 15:20-22. As the nexus of redemption and re-creation, the resurrection is crucial – for the focus of the atonement is not merely to sentence sin with its proper exile, but to fulfill God’s creative purposes for unity and participation in the divine life.\n[14] Carl F.

First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn what follows, I propose that \u003cstrong\u003ewe can best account for both (1) the relationship between general and special hermeneutics and (2) the relationship between biblical and theological studies by first attending to Scripture’s theological location regarding its subject matter – the all-encompassing story, to which it bears witness, of how the triune God creates and redeems a people unto fellowship with himself.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first section, I will argue that the Scripture plays an authoritative role in the all-encompassing story to which it bears witness. After briefly summarizing the subject matter of Scripture, I will explain Scripture’s role by explaining the relationships between Scripture and (1) God, (2) creation, and (3) God’s people. With respect to God, Scripture is the authoritative and inspired word of the triune God, which God uses to reveal himself and redeem his creatures. With respect to creation, because Scripture’s subject matter is all-encompassing, there is no domain outside of its purview. And with respect to God’s people, Scripture is unavoidably and irreducibly ecclesiological.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we clarify the relationship between Scripture and its subject matter, if the story to which Scripture bears witness is true, then the relationships between (1) special and general hermeneutics and (2) biblical and theological studies become much less problematic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the second section, therefore, I maintain that, because Scripture plays a uniquely authoritative role within its all-encompassing subject matter, theological hermeneutics encompasses both special and general hermeneutics. This has implications for two related hermeneutical triads: the general hermeneutical triad of author, text, and reader, and the special hermeneutical triad of historical, literary, and theological analysis. My approach calls for giving theology pride of place in both triads. That is, the divine author, the Christ-centered text, and the Spirit-led interpretive community of the Church are of primary importance. Nevertheless, due to the historically particular way(s) in which the triune God has revealed himself and redeemed his people, a theological hermeneutic requires attending to the historical and literary particularities of \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e authors, texts, and readers – especially to those involved in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, in the third section, I offer an account of biblical and theological studies as a single multifaceted discipline, one that includes both biblical studies and the various theological sub-disciplines of historical, systematic, and pastoral theology. Because Scripture’s subject matter is complex, unified, and irreducibly ecclesiological, biblical and theological studies need each other. This has, I believe, implications for how the contested and contentious fields of biblical theology and the theological interpretation of Scripture ought to relate to each other.  Furthermore, because the Church’s understanding of and participation in Scripture’s subject matter is historically, conceptually, and practically complex, the theological subdisciplines need each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"The Hermeneutical Implications of Scripture's Theological Location"},{"content":"Why write out a list of principles?\nFor one thing, it\u0026rsquo;s my birthday.

It was challenging to do, but also a helpful exercise! I challenge you to write out your own story in approximately 500 words.\nTestimony For as long as I can remember, I have known and followed Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. However, there has been a lingering problem in our relationship – on my end. Of course, this problem is called “sin.” But, I mean an even more specific problem: my struggle to know Jesus, and not merely to know about Jesus.\n(For an attempted summary of the content of my Christian faith, what I believe, see \u0026ldquo;What Do I Believe? A Cross-Centered Credo.\u0026rdquo;)\nChildhood I have always placed a high premium on knowing and telling the truth. As a precocious five-year-old, an intellectual conundrum led me to ask my father how we could be brothers in Christ, though I was his son.\nThankfully, he did not respond with a merely intellectual explanation, but rather a gospel presentation. I prayed the “Sinner’s Prayer,” and my faith journey since then has been a long lesson that real Truth is not a proposition to comprehend, nor a weapon to wield, but a person to love, trust, and obey.\nUnfortunately, I have often found it easier to wage intellectual battle than to trust and obey. Knowing all the right answers in Sunday School did little to assuage my pride, lust, anger, and fear.\nThankfully, however, Christ has not given up on me. Instead, through his Word and Church, he has reminded me time and time again that my intellect is to be used in loving, self-sacrificial service – and not in self-defense.\nHigh School In high school, Christ opened my eyes to a world in need and gave me a glimpse of how the gifts he had given me might be used to meet the world’s needs.\nHowever, to my shame, I had devoted more time and effort into learning things like calculus and Spanish than to learning the gospel. For this reason, I decided to devote my undergraduate studies to learning the gospel in order to preach it to others. I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Preseminary Bible just three weeks before classes began.\nCollege In college, I fell in love with the gospel, with biblical and theological studies, and with a young nursing student who loved Jesus and wanted to use her gifts (medical and otherwise) to serve him.\nWe decided to follow Christ together as husband and wife. After we were married in 2012, God opened the doors for us to come to Birmingham, AL, where I have continued my pastoral training at Beeson Divinity School and served as a Youth Minister at St. Peter’s Anglican Church. My wife has lovingly cared for the sick and the poor, first as a Registered Nurse, and now as a Nurse Practitioner.\n(Want to read my wedding vows? You can do so here.)\nSeminary and Beyond Seminary ( Beeson Divinity School), youth ministry, and my recent ordination to the diaconate have confirmed my pastoral calling. I want to spend the rest of my life serving the world by serving the Church. That is, I want to advance God’s kingdom academically, globally, and pastorally as part professor, missionary, and (primarily a) pastor.\nAlthough merely knowing about Jesus is still a temptation, I know that my Savior is faithful. He can use my life to help heal a world that desperately needs to know him.\nOK, that\u0026rsquo;s my testimony, in brief. What\u0026rsquo;s yours?

For the uninitiated, here\u0026rsquo;s a nice video about what podcasts are:\nCurrently, podcasts are one of my very favorite ways to consume information about a wide variety of topics. Sure, gun to my head, I\u0026rsquo;ll choose books over podcasts as a way to learn. However, unlike books (or videos), you can easily listen to podcasts while doing other things - whether folding laundry, washing dishes, or going for a run/walk.\n(Note: as I mentioned in my list of favorite tools and apps, Overcast is my current favorite podcast player. Although, there are plenty of other worthy podcast players/managers to check out!)\nThere are no shortage of podcasts, or lists of best podcasts, for that matter. However, here are my current favorites.\nMy Favorite Podcasts: Up First (NPR) This is the first podcast I listen to every weekday while making coffee. I love that it\u0026rsquo;s short (˜10 minutes) and that it provides some snapshots of important news stories that day. In addition to Up First, I frequently listen to NPR newscasts via their NPR One app, which is worth checking out!\nThe Art of Manliness Sure, the egalitarian in me wishes there were a show out there called \u0026ldquo;The Art of Humanity\u0026rdquo; - about how to be a Mensch. However, in the meantime, Brett McKay has a solid podcast going about \u0026ldquo;reviving the lost art of manliness.\u0026rdquo; I enjoy the podcast (and t he Art of Manliness website) because it includes so many helpful how-to guides - for everything from weightlifting to men\u0026rsquo;s fashion.\nWord \u0026amp; Table I created Rookie Anglican as a way of making Anglicanism more accessible. This podcast, Word \u0026amp; Table, has much the same mission, although it\u0026rsquo;s focus is not just on Anglicanism, but rather on the rich Christian tradition of liturgical worship. As I wrote about the podcast over at Rookie Anglican:\nAccording to their website, Word \u0026amp; Table “is a weekly podcast about liturgy, sacrament, and the great tradition of Christian worship and why it is vital in our world today.”\nThe podcast was started back in October 2016, and it’s hosted by Alex Wilgus and Fr. Stephen Gauthier, the Canon Theologian for the Anglican Church in North America’s Diocese of the Upper Midwest.\nYou can subscribe to the podcast via iTunes, listen to episodes via the Word \u0026amp; Table website, or simply search for “Word and Table” in your podcast player/manager of choice.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve got questions about anything related to the Christian tradition, check out the Word \u0026amp; Table podcast to see if they have an episode on the topic!\nThe Tim Ferriss Show I\u0026rsquo;ve become somewhat of a Tim Ferriss junkie in the past two years. In addition to this podcast - which features long-form interviews with \u0026ldquo;top performers,\u0026rdquo; in which Tim distils tips, tricks, habits, and practices for the common person - Ferriss\u0026rsquo; books are well worth checking out (Affiliate LInks: The 4-Hour Workweek; The 4-Hour Body; The 4-Hour Chef; Tools of Titans) . He\u0026rsquo;s great at teaching metalearning- how to learn how to learn!\n(Note: Tim Ferriss is how I found out about kettlebells - one of my favorite tools for personal fitness.)\nCoffee Break German Sure, Coffee Break German hasn\u0026rsquo;t taught me the kind of German that I\u0026rsquo;ll need for my Ph.D. German translation exam. However, it is a very informative introduction to basic/conversational German. It makes a wonderful companion to Duolingo for language learning! Radio Lingua Network offers a whole suite of \u0026ldquo;Coffee Break\u0026rdquo; languages, including French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Chinese!\nThis American Life In my opinion, no podcast beats This American Life in terms of the quality and variety of storytelling. It\u0026rsquo;s well worth your time, in addition to the \u0026ldquo;spinoff\u0026rdquo; shows Serial and S-Town.\nHonorable Mentions: The Art of Charm Always Forward: Anglican Church Planting Monday Morning Preacher Malcolm Gladwell\u0026rsquo;s Revisionist History Optimal Living Daily So tell me, what are your favorite podcasts?\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-favorite-podcasts/","summary":"Podcasts: An Introduction Although podcasts (think \u0026ldquo;iPod\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;broadcast\u0026rdquo;) have been around for over a decade, we\u0026rsquo;re living in a bit of a golden age - or a least a Rennaissance - of the medium.

You can listen to the sermon here:\nYour browser does not support the audio element. GOODBYES SUCK You know, if there’s one thing I hate, it’s goodbyes. Anyone else here hate goodbyes?\nYeah, and the fact that I hate them so much means I’m not really very good at goodbyes.\nSometimes I get awkward and silent. Sometimes I get awkward and really chatty! Heck, sometimes I get awkward and I make poor choices, like the one time when I was getting ready to say goodbye to my family when they dropped me off at college.\nThey were looking forward to a final dinner with me, in the school cafeteria, before they left. But I was worried about the awkwardness of saying a tearful goodbye between packed tables and chairs, so I suggested that they just leave.\nLet’s just say that my family wasn’t very happy. And me? Neither was I. I ate my first college meal all alone.\nGoodbyes suck. And I often suck at goodbyes.\nWhy am I telling you this?\nWell, for one thing, this is my “goodbye” sermon here at St. Peter’s, and I wanted to give an excuse for this sermon, if it sucks!\nIn all seriousness, I do want to thank this congregation for being such a good place for Rachel and me to serve and grow alongside you. Thank you for loving Rachel and me as our brothers and sisters in Christ. We will miss you all very much as we move to Illinois this week.\nAnyways, I don’t want this goodbye to get TOO awkward, so I’d better keep on preaching!\nI think that goodbyes are bad because they so often leave our stories unfinished.\nAnd we humans tend to hate unfinished business. It’s so much better when the story has an end! Sometimes, even a bad ending is better than no ending at all!\nThink about it, if you’re watching an important game on TV – say, Alabama vs. Auburn – would you rather see the ending, even if your team loses, or have the power go out and completely miss the final minutes?\nStories without endings are frustrating. And that’s why it’s so hard to say goodbye.\nThat’s why Death – the ultimate goodbye, if you will – is so horrible.\nIt’s not really an ending, not for those of us who go on living, anyways. Instead, Death leaves our stories hanging, with words left unsaid and promises left unfulfilled.\nI think here of parents in Manchester this week who were forced to say goodbye to their children all too soon, thanks to the suicide bombing. Or the Coptic Christians in Egypt forced to say goodbye to their loved ones too soon, thanks to the bus attack.\nGoodbyes suck, because they leave our stories unfinished.\n(Note: For other sermons, check out my Sermons page.)\nWHAT ABOUT THE ASCENSION? DOES IT SUCK? Is the Ascension of Jesus Christ, then, just another awful goodbye?\nI mean, think about the emotional rollercoaster Christ’s followers must have ridden in those days. Rising hopes of God’s coming kingdom dashed to the ground at the Crucifixion – only to rise once more at the Resurrection!\n“Jesus, you’re alive! Surely, surely now’s the time when you’re going to restore the kingdom to Israel, right?!\n“I mean, you had us worried there for a minute, what with the whole executed like a common criminal thing… but SURELY now’s the time!\n“Seize the day! Take the throne! Kill these Romans, won’t you?! Won’t you?!”\n… Now, I’m sure that the Ascension was glorious. After all, Luke tells us that the disciples worshiped and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.\nBut the Ascension was still a goodbye.\nAnd I’m sure that, eventually, the glory faded as the disciples gazed into heaven. And they needed the angels’ reminder:\n“Men of Galilee, who do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven” [Acts 1:11].\nOK, so maybe it’s fairer to say that the Ascension was a “see-you-later.”\nFine.\nBut doesn’t the Ascension still leave things hanging?\nDoesn’t it still leave our story – and the story of the Gospel – unfinished?\nWell, yes…and no.\nIf I might paraphrase the angels’ message in Acts 1 as the title of my sermon, here it is:\n“It’s finished! So, get to work!”\nAnd here’s my main point:\nThe Ascension completes the Gospel and compels the Church.\nHOW DOES THE ASCENSION COMPLETE THE GOSPEL? How does the Ascension complete the Gospel?\nWell, that requires knowing what the Gospel is, so here goes:\nTHE GOSPEL In the beginning, God created the entire universe to be his temple, his kingdom – the place where he would dwell and rule.\nAnd he created human beings – his image-bearers, his ambassadors, his “middle-management” – to extend his rule and reign throughout creation.\nInstead of doing this, however, human beings rebelled against God.\nInstead of bowing the knee to the King, they tried to steal his throne.\nAnd this rebellion brought Sin and Death into the kingdom – breaking the relationships\nbetween God and humanity, between humanity and itself, and between humanity and the rest of creation. Where once there was perfect fellowship and communion, there was now distance and Exile.\nAnd the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.\nBecause, you see, God was not going to let Sin, Death, and Exile have the final word! No!\nHe would pursue his people, he would buy them back from their slavery to Sin and Death, he would cleanse them from the inside out, and he would – one day – bring them back home.\nThe story of God’s rescue mission, then, is the Good News – it’s the Gospel.\nIn the Old Testament, the story of Israel is the beginning of this rescue mission.\nIn the Old Testament, God draws a people back into covenant relationship with himself.\nAnd yet, the story of the Old Testament is left hanging on a tragic note.\nDespite God’s continuing goodness, faithfulness, and salvation, his people prove stubbornly faithless.\nAnd, even though they technically dwell in the geographical Promised Land, they are still in Exile.\nThey are still ruled, in the halls of power, by their political enemies. And they are still ruled, in their hearts, by Sin and Death.\nAnd the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.\nBecause, you see, in the New Testament, God HIMSELF goes into Exile INSTEAD OF his people, in order to bring them back home.\nI’d like you to picture this as a capital letter “V”.\nUp here, you’ve got the eternal Son of God – fully divine.\nDown here, is us. Drowning, as it were, in a cesspool of Sin and Death.\nAnd instead of abandoning us…\n(Heck, even instead of somehow saving us at an arm’s distance, after we start to clean up and get our act together.)\n…Christ dives headfirst into the muck – into the cesspool of sin-stained human existence.\nWe call this the Incarnation.\nSo, great! God’s with us! In..this…cesspool! …Great?\nAt the Crucifixion, Jesus goes all the way to the very bottom point of that capital V.\nHe goes all the way into the furthest, farthest Exile – Death.\nSo, great! God’s dead.\nHow is this good news?!\nWell, the story would have ended there, a tragedy, were it not for the goodness of our great God.\nBecause, you see, he went into the farthest Exile, so that we wouldn’t have to.\nAnd he didn’t stay in the grave. No no no!\nThere’s another side to the capital V!\nWe can’t forget the Resurrection!\nJesus arose from the grave – he walked out of that tomb on Easter morning AAAAANNNNND…..\n…\nWell, we don’t know.\nHe appeared to some people. And then, well, we’re not really sure what happened to him.\nWe’re not really sure what it all meant.\n…\nThe story would have ended there, left hanging between tragedy and triumph, were it not for the Ascension.\nHOW THE ASCENSION COMPLETES THE GOSPEL Brothers and sisters, we can’t forget the Ascension!\nThe Ascension COMPLETES the Gospel!\nThe Ascension is the final step in Christ’s return from Exile.\nAnd, if we are united with Christ as a part of his body, the Church, the Ascension is the completion of OUR return from Exile as well!\nThe Ascension demonstrates that the Crucifixion and Resurrection were the final victory over Sin and Death.\nFurthermore, the fact that Christ is not only crucified, and not only risen, but also ascended, and glorified, and seated on his heavenly throne means that he is the LORD.\nJesus Christ, though still fully human, though still fully acquainted with our many griefs, is not your buddy.\nHe’s not your pal that you can ignore at your convenience.\nNo, the Ascension reminds us that Christ is our King.\nHe is our Lord. And he is to be obeyed.\nBut, hey, since the capital V is finished, and Christ is on the throne, that means that we can all just sit around and do nothing, right?!\nAs long as we’re not doing something horrible?\nI mean, the story’s OVER! I thought that’s what you just said, Josh.\nNo, not quite!\nThe Ascension does complete the Gospel – as its goal and culmination.\nWe will all one day be with Christ at the Father’s right hand in glory.\nBut the story’s not over, because the Ascension also compels the Church.\nThe Ascension completes the Gospel, and it also compels the Church.\nHOW DOES THE ASCENSION COMPEL THE CHURCH? How does the Ascension compel the Church?\nWell, the Ascension gives the Church\nits global mission, its enduring hope, and its enabling power. Everyone with me so far?\nWe’ve talked about the Ascension’s theological significance, how the Ascension completes the Gospel.\nNow let’s talk about the Ascension’s application to our lives – how the Ascension should both challenge us and encourage us.\nTHE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS GLOBAL MISSION Here’s the challenge of the Ascension: it gives the Church its global mission.\nAs Luke told us twice today – in the book of Acts and the Gospel which bears his name – Jesus commissioned his followers as witnesses who were to proclaim the Good News across cultural and ethnic boundaries.\n“to all nations” – that word, “nations,” ethnoi, more properly refers to people groups, to cultural and ethnic groups of people, than to modern nation states.\nThat is, there are plenty of ethnoi represented right here in the United States – including those that haven’t yet heard the gospel!\nYou remember what I said a minute ago about Jesus not being our buddy?\nHe’s our King! He’s to be obeyed!\nAnd he wants us to proclaim the gospel to the entire world.\nWhich, let’s be honest, is easier said than done.\nWhy?\nBecause God’s global gospel runs counter to the nationalistic, tribalistic, and individualistic “gospels” of this earth.\nThe Good News of God’s global kingdom – won not through self-promotion or military conquest but through self-sacrifice and loving one’s enemies – this gospel runs counter to the false gospels of this world, including the false gospel of the American Dream.\nAnd that cuts right across the grain of the entire political landscape – red state and blue state.\nNow to be sure, hear me!, there is a difference between globalism and God’s global gospel.\nBut there is also a stark difference between the United States of America and the Kingdom of God – between American culture and Kingdom culture.\nLet us, then, take heed, lest we American Christians make assimilation to American culture an unofficial prerequisite for the nations of the world.\nThere is no prerequisite.\nThere is no response of the world that gives the Church an excuse to abandon its global mission.\nIn light of the Ascension, the Church’s global mission is to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ across all cultural and ethnic boundaries – obeying its Ascended Lord, who once said:\n“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” [Matt. 5:43-44].\nOK, so this transcultural, enemy-loving gospel stuff sounds great hypothetically, but\nwhat about when people blow themselves up to kill children at a concert in Manchester? What about when people open fire on a bus full of Coptic Christians on their way to pray? What about when they go on shooting sprees in shopping malls, movie theaters, schools, and churches? Or what about when people are just so different, so unfamiliar, so awkward, that we just don’t know what to say? What then?\nDo we throw up our hands in despair?\nTHE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS ENDURING HOPE Here’s the encouragement of the Ascension: it gives the Church its enduring hope.\nWithout the Ascension, we are left wondering whether the good news of Christ’s resurrection will extend to us.\nWe are left wondering whether the chaos in the world around us will ever cease.\nHow long, O Lord? How long before you stay the hand of the wicked?\nHow long before you destroy the earthly powers and dominions and authorities that divide us and destroy us?\nFriends, we can still ask these questions today, but it makes all the difference in the world that Christ has ascended.\nIt makes all the difference in the world that Christ has been enthroned over all earthly powers and dominions and authorities.\nWhy?\nBecause the Ascension shows that Christ has triumphed over his enemies.\nThe way of the Cross has won out over the sinful ways of this world.\nAnd the Ascension also anticipates the second coming of Christ.\nJust like Jesus did not stay in the grave, he will not stay at a distance upon his heavenly throne – present in the Church only sacramentally.\nNo!\nAnd just like he did not let Sin and Death have the final word, he will not let the servants of Sin and Death have the final word, either.\nInstead, he will one day stay the hand of the wicked.\nHe will one day disarm and destroy those who have decided to persist in rebellion against him.\nChrist is enthroned over all earthly powers! This is our enduring hope!\nThere’s no reason for us to hedge our bets, as it were, by bending the knee to any earthly power – friend or foe.\nInstead, the Church can freely exist for the sake of the world, because we know that the world is in the hands of our ascended King.\nTHE ASCENSION GIVES THE CHURCH ITS ENABLING POWER: THE HOLY SPIRIT So, you know, just get out there and try harder to love people and let them know about Jesus, no matter how different they are!\nRight?!\nWrong.\nWe’re not fooling anyone. We can’t do this on our own.\nSure, we’ve got a global mission. And sure, we’ve got an enduring hope.\nBut we still need enabling power.\nAnd the Ascension gives the Church its enabling power: the Holy Spirit.\nAt the end of Luke’s Gospel, Jesus tells his disciples:\n“And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high” [Luke 24:53].\nAnd, at the beginning of Acts, Jesus\n“ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, ‘you heard from me; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now” [Acts 1:4-5].\nA few verses later, Jesus says:\n“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” [Acts 1:8].\nNow, I know I’m getting a bit ahead of myself.\nAfter all, it’s still a week until Pentecost!\nBut, brothers and sisters, we can’t make it, not even for a week, without the Holy Spirit!\nWe are only gathered here this morning, some two thousand years since the Ascension, on the other side of the world, because the Holy Spirit has empowered the Church to fulfill its global mission.\nAnd, even though we live in a divided, divisive, and terrifying world, the Holy Spirit can empower the Church today.\nSo, thanks be to God that the Ascension and Pentecost go hand in hand!\nTHE ASCENSION COMPLETES THE GOSPEL AND COMPELS THE CHURCH TO FULFILL ITS GLOBAL MISSION, CLINGING TO ITS ENDURING HOPE, EMPOWERED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. So, Father, we thank you for your persistence and patience to rescue us from Sin and Death.\nJesus, we bow the knee and worship you, our Ascended Lord. And we ask you to come again soon and make all things new.\nAnd Holy Spirit, we ask you come. Give us the strength to love our neighbors and our enemies by proclaiming and living the gospel.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/20170613it-is-finished-so-get-to-work-an-ascension-sermon/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe following is an \u0026ldquo;It is Finished\u0026rdquo; sermon preached on Ascension Sunday, 2017.

So, Get to Work! - A Sermon on the Ascension"},{"content":" Your browser does not support the audio element. There is something special about last meals, isn’t there?\nI’d like to show you a series of photographs. These photographs, except for the last one – which I added, are from a piece called “No Seconds,” and they were put together by Henry Hargreaves.\nI don’t want to belabor the artwork with my commentary, so I’ll give you a few seconds to take each slide in.\nNow, I don’t know about you, but those pictures affect me deeply. The whole idea of a criminal’s last meal affects me deeply. Why?\nI think it’s because these last meals combine the familiar with the unfamiliar. They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes. The stuff of life right next to life’s untimely end.\nWhile Jesus of Nazareth was no common criminal, his so-called “Last Supper” with his disciples was a poignant combination of the expected and the unexpected. And when you take a look at the Last Supper, focusing on its unexpected elements, you find out that it’s really a Lasting Supper.\nThat is, the Last Supper is not just a one-time event, some two-thousand years ago. Instead, Holy Communion, the Lasting Supper, is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present.\nThe Meal First, let’s look at the original meal itself, the “Last Supper,” as described in our Gospel lesson (Luke 22:14-20).\nPassover: An Interpretive Celebration Now, as expected, the Passover was an interpretive celebration, because it looked back to the Exodus event – when God rescued his people from slavery in Egypt – in order to explain what salvation looked like.\nThat is, if you asked any respectable Hebrew what it meant to “be saved,” you would much more likely hear “it’s like when God saved us from Egypt” than “you get to go to heaven after you die.”\nAlthough Passover originated with Exodus 12’s instructions for a hasty meal, eaten while standing a fully dressed, by Jesus’ time the meal had evolved into an elaborate affair.\nAs best we can tell, in Jesus’ day the meal was structured around four cups of wine. According to New Testament scholar Joel Green, the meal had the following outline:\nThe head of the family would pronounce a blessing over the first cup of wine, which was then shared. Before the second cup, the youngest son would ask the father questions about what made this night special. The father would reply by telling the Exodus story, focusing on the summary given in Deut. 26:5-11. The dinner party would then sing Psalm 113, and then drink the second cup of wine. The father would then bless, break, and distribute the unleavened bread, followed by the main meal. Finally, they would consume two more cups of wine, before singing Psalms 114-118. Why am I telling you this?\nBecause we need to realize that the Passover was no ordinary meal.\nInstead, it was an interpretive meal. Words went right along with the food, in order to situate the dinner party in the midst of God’s ongoing Story of Salvation.\nEspecially given the combination of the Exodus story with the prayers and praises found in Psalms 113-118, the Passover was\na remembrance of God’s past deliverance, a celebration of God’s present faithfulness, and an anticipation of God’s future deliverance. The past, the present, and the future came together in one meal.\nHere’s the framework, or the timeline, if you will:\nThe original Passover meal (Exod. 12) The Exodus from Egypt The establishment of the Covenant Yearly remembrance of the Passover In hope of future, final redemption Got that?\nPassover, Exodus, Covenant, Remembrance, Hope.\nOK, so this is really important: Israel didn’t merely remember the Passover each year to know something but in order to change.\nIn other words, Passover was supposed to be a transformative remembrance.\nRemembering God’s faithfulness was supposed to transform them into God’s faithful followers. Remembering God’s faithfulness was supposed to transform them into God’s faithful covenant partners.\nSo much for the expected aspects of the Last Supper: it was an interpretive Passover.\nAn Unexpected Paradigm Shift What is unexpected about this meal is how Jesus shifts the paradigm! He takes the whole “Passover, Exodus, Covenant, Remembrance, Hope” timeline and makes himself the center of it!\nAs the “head of the household,” it’s not strange that Jesus would be the chief speaker during this Passover Meal. However, in vv. 15-16, things start to get weird. Jesus frames the meal as his last meal, prophetically looking forward to his suffering and death.\nAnd yet, perhaps it’s better to say his “second-to-last meal,” because in verses 16 – 18, he predicts that death will not have the final word. Instead, he will partake of the full and final Passover again in the coming kingdom of God!\nRemember, we’re expecting Jesus to give an explanation and interpretation of the Exodus story. When Jesus takes the bread and the wine, we expect him to say: “do this in remembrance of the Exodus from Egypt…do this in remembrance of the Covenant.”\nInstead, he says: “do this in remembrance of ME!”\nThis shifts the timeline forward, from Israel’s transformative remembrance of the Passover to the Church’s transformative remembrance of the fulfillment of the Passover, the Lord’s Supper.\nPassover points to the Lord’s Supper, Holy Communion.\nNew Exodus, New Covenant What about the Exodus and the Covenant? Do they point to anything?\nThey do!\nBoth the Exodus and the Covenant are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, through the New Exodus and the New Covenant!\nIn the original Exodus, God saved his people, through Moses, from slavery in Egypt.\nIn the New Exodus, God saves his people, through Jesus Christ, from slavery to Sin and Death.\nIn the original Covenant, God gives his people the Law, through Moses, written upon tablets of stone.\nIn the New Covenant, God gives his people the Law, the Gospel! through Jesus Christ, and writes it upon their hearts.\nWe see this first in Jesus’ unexpected words about the bread, interpreted as Christ’s battered body.\nLook at verse 19. Instead of the expected words about the Passover lamb at this point in the meal, Luke speaks only of Christ’s body, sacrificially “given” for the sake of his disciples.\nThen, in verse 20, there are Jesus’ even more shocking words about the cup, which is interpreted as New Covenant blood!\nBecause the Jews were strictly prohibited from consuming blood (Deut. 12:16, 23-4), there were probably quite a few audible sputters when Christ declared: “this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood” (Luke 22:20)!\nJesus is claiming that, just as the Old Covenant was ratified by blood (see Exod. 24:8), his impending death will ratify the New Covenant of Jeremiah 31:31-34. The sacrifice will be God himself, upon the Cross!\nAnd, according to Jeremiah 31, the New Covenant will bring\nknowledge of God, loyalty to God, and forgiveness of sins. Yahweh says:\n“I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.\nAnd I will be their God, and they shall be my people.\nAnd no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord.\nFor I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more” (Jer. 31:33-34).\nPassover and Holy Communion: An Expanded Timeline So, to review, the previous timeline was:\nOriginal Passover Original Exodus Establishment of the Covenant Israel’s Remembrance in Passover meals Hope for future, final redemption Now, the church’s timeline builds upon the previous one:\nOriginal Last Supper New Exodus (accomplished at Cross) New Covenant (accomplished at Cross) Church’s Remembrance in Holy Communion Hope for future, final redemption In Holy Communion, we Christians are called to the transformative remembrance of what Christ has accomplished at the Cross.\nBut we don’t just look back to the Cross. We also look forward to what Jesus will accomplish at the final redemption. You know, when he returns to judge the living and the dead, to right every wrong, and to wipe away every tear!\nWhen we take Holy Communion, we await the heavenly banquet that will fully fulfill both the Passover and the Lord’s Supper.\nEveryone with me so far?\nJust as Passover was designed to be a transformative remembrance, to shape the Israelites into faithful followers of God, so too Holy Communion is a transformative remembrance.\nIt’s meant to transform us into faithful followers of Jesus Christ, faithful members of Christ’s body, the Church!\nWhat Does Transformative Remembrance Look Like? But, what does that look like?\nSure, I’ve mentioned that the New Covenant is meant to result in\nknowledge of God, loyalty to god, and the forgiveness of sins. But seriously: What does that look like?\nLet’s take a quick look at the rest of our passage, Luke 22:21-30.\nIs anyone else confused by how quickly the scene seems to change?\nI mean, one moment (v. 20), Jesus is saying the words of institution, and then the very next moment (v. 21-22) Jesus is predicting his betrayal!\nIn v. 23, the disciples are understandably confused. But then (v. 24) they immediately start bickering about who’s the greatest disciple!\nSo, Jesus has to remind them (vv. 25-30) that, in his kingdom, true greatness and authority come only through sacrificial service.\nWhat in the world is going on here?\nI think that these final scenes in our passage offer us a challenging reminder of how the Lord’s Lasting Supper should shape us.\nThey show us, albeit through the failure of Judas and the disciples, how the remembrance of Holy Communion should transform us into sacrificial servants of Jesus Christ and one another.\nServants? Or Traitors? Let me put it to you this way:\nWhen you come to the Lord’s Table, you either come as a servant or a traitor.\nYou either live a life of serving as you are served by Jesus, or you live a life of grabbing glory and honor and power for yourself.\nIn our New Testament lesson from 1 Corinthians, the Apostle Paul said the following:\n“Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.\nLet a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup” (1 Cor. 11:27-28).\nNow, you can ask yourself many different questions during this process of self-examination, but here’s one for your consideration: do my “table manners” match Jesus’ table manners?\nHere are some of the last words of exhortation Jesus gives to his disciples:\n“The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those in authority over them are called benefactors.\nBut not so with you.\nRather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.\nFor who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves?\nIs it not the one who reclines at table?\nBut I am among you as the one who serves” (Luke 22:25-27).\nI’ve got good news, friends: Jesus is still among us today as the one who serves.\nLike always, he gives us his very self, for the sake of our salvation.\nWill we follow his example? Will we gratefully accept his service, and – in joyful response to his salvation – serve others in Jesus’ name? Or will we come in betrayal, seeking honor for only ourselves?\nFoot Washing Now, during our service of Holy Communion, we are going to have a service of Foot-Washing. During that time, I’d like you to remember that the same Lord who washed his disciples’ feet – the dirtiest parts of their bodies – now washes away even the dirtiest parts of our lives with his blood.\nAnd I’d like you to ask yourself: are you living a life of Christ-like service?\nSure, maybe you don’t wash other people’s feet all the time, but are you willing to sacrificially serve others, as you yourself have been served by Jesus?\nThe answer, by the way, is NOT “try harder! Be better! Serve more!” No!\nINSTEAD, it is to surrender your entire life to Jesus. Only when you’ve accepted his salvation and his lordship will you be able to serve others out of the overflow of Christ’s love in your life.\nThe Lord\u0026rsquo;s Table And of course, in addition to the foot-washing, we will come to the Lord’s Table. And, during that time, I’d like you to remember that the same Messiah who so frequently ate with outcasts and sinners now welcomes us outcasts and sinners to come to his table and receive the saving benefits of his broken body and his shed blood.\nFriends, do our table manners match Jesus’ table manners? Are we reaching out to outcasts and sinners and welcoming them to our tables at home? Are we letting the hurting, the lost, and the broken around us know where they can find food and drink that lead to true, everlasting life?\nRemember: the Lasting Supper is an ongoing meal, with profound implications for our past, our future, and our present. When you come to the Lord’s table, you either come as a traitor or a servant.\nThanks be to God, who invites us all to the table of our Lord Jesus Christ, where he is the gracious host and we are the rebellious traitors who are transformed into faithful servants.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/maundy-thursday-sermon-the-lasting-supper-luke-2214-30/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere is something special about last meals, isn’t there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d like to show you a series of photographs.

[ MP3: Getting Ahead in God\u0026rsquo;s Upside-Down Kingdom]\n[ PDF Sermon Manuscript: Getting Ahead in God\u0026rsquo;s Upside-Down Kingdom]\nOpening Prayer God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:\npromote your justice embody your steadfast faithful love and humbly obey Your will, even if it costs us our reputations, and even if it costs us our lives.\nI ask that this transformation would begin with me. In Jesus’ name. Amen.\nIntroduction I’d like to start off with a very basic question: Do you want to get ahead in life?\nDo you want things to get better? Do you want your life, and your children’s lives, to improve?\nI mean, despite the many things that divide us humans, don’t we all want progress? When it comes right down to it, don’t we all just want to get ahead?\nI know I do.\nIn fact, as the students in our youth group could tell you, this is one of the reasons why I love “life hacks”!\nHave you heard of life hacks? They’re these little tips and tricks to get ahead in life while saving time, money, and effort.\nLike, one of my favorite life hacks is the “coffee nap.” You drink a cup of coffee, then immediately take a 20-minute nap, so that the caffeine kicks in right as you wake up.\nLife hack. Try it sometime. Thank me later.\nANYWAYS, we all want to get ahead in life. Right?\nBut there’s a problem: How do we know what getting ahead looks like?\nI mean, think about it. Getting ahead can look quite different in different contexts. Right?\nPerhaps this is too crude of an example for a sermon, but getting ahead in a drinking game looks totally different than getting ahead in Alcoholics Anonymous!\nGetting ahead in the NBA Finals hopefully looks different than getting ahead in playing basketball with your kids.\nGetting ahead on Wall Street as a day-trader hopefully looks different than getting ahead in running a charity.\nIn order to get ahead,\nyou have to know the context, you have to know the rules, you have to know the goal. Otherwise, no matter how hard you try, you’re not really going to get ahead. You’ll just be getting ahead at the wrong thing. Which means you’ll fail.\nSo here’s the kicker: Getting ahead in God’s eyes looks a whole lot different than getting ahead in the world’s eyes.\nThe world is a different context. The world follows different rules. And the world has a different goal than God’s Kingdom.\nThe Main Point In fact, and here’s my main point if you want to write it down:\nBecause God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s Upside-Down Kingdom - 1 Corinthians 1:18-31 Now, this is the message of all of our readings for today, but I’d like to start with the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:18. (You can find it on page 952 in your pew Bible.)\n1 Corinthians 1:18 says:\nFor the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing (that’s what I’m calling “the world,” by the way – those who are perishing), but to us who are being saved(that is, to us who are a part of God’s Kingdom) it is the power of God.\nYou see, God’s not against getting ahead. In fact, you could even say that God is on a mission to “Make Creation Great Again”!\nI’m not kidding! He made it great in the first place – a perfect universe with perfect relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation.\nHowever, ever since we humans rebelled against God – ever since Sin shattered the relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation – God has been on a mission to put everything back together again.\nSounds great, right?\nSo why is Paul saying that the good news of God’s rescue mission is foolishness to the world?\nBecause God makes creation great again in a totally unexpected way!\nThis is what I mean by “God’s upside-down kingdom.”\nIn order to make the world right again, God shows up and reverses the ways the world has gotten used to working. And the greatest reversal of all in God’s upside-down kingdom is when the eternal Son of God becomes human and gets himself killed for the sins of the entire world.\nThe world expects\npower, might, strength, and victory, and we receive instead a\nnaked, abandoned Middle-Eastern man, brutally executed as a political criminal. We receive a bloody example for those who would dare challenge the kingdoms of this world.\nWe receive a Crucified Savior. And the world calls that absolutely RIDICULOUS.\nBecause, to the world, you don’t get ahead by laying your life down (like Jesus did). You get ahead by taking what’s yours.\nYou don’t get ahead by hanging out with the wrong crowd (like Jesus did). You’re supposed to rub shoulders with the rich and the famous, not the poor and the homeless.\nYou’re not supposed to focus on the people at the bottom and at the border (like Jesus did)!\nFor crying out loud, you’re supposed to get out there and hustle!\nClimb the ladder! Make deals! Take no prisoners! Make demands! Get ahead! …And get right back where we need to be saved FROM!\nThat’s where the world’s ways get us.\nWhere every human is\nan egotistical island, competing with God, alienating other humans, and abusing creation. Thankfully, as Paul tells us in [1 Cor 1:25],\nthe foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\nIn the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God saves us through what looks like foolishness and weakness.\nWhy? So that we would not boast in our pathetic “wisdom” and “strength.”\nInstead, we are to boast only in the true wisdom and strength of God.\nPaul continues in [1 Cor. 1:27]:\nBut God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; 28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, 29 so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.\nThis, then, is the upside-down Kingdom of God.\nBlessed are the \u0026ldquo;Losers\u0026rdquo; - Matthew 5:1-12 And it’s the exact same Kingdom that we find in the Beatitudes of Matthew 5.\n(FYI: We call them the “Beatitudes” because of the Latin word for “blessed/happy” – beatus.)\nNow, remember: God isn’t against getting ahead. He really does want what’s best for us.\nBut the danger is that we’ll try to get ahead on our own, in our own way. And if we do that, we’ll miss the point in at least two ways.\nFirst, we won’t realize that we desperately need a Savior, and that we cannot save ourselves. Second, we will ignore the very people that God wants us to care for in order to really get ahead in his Kingdom! That is, on our own, we’re going to focus on those at the center and height of power. You know, “The Winners.”\nBut God focuses on those at the bottom and at the borders, the edges of society. You know, “The Losers.”\nThese are the people who will experience God’s favor in his Upside-Down Kingdom. Take a look at [ Matthew 5:3-12].\nNotice how Jesus declares God’s favor, His blessing, to what the world would call the “wrong kind of people.”\nTo the poor in spirit Those who mourn The meek Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness The merciful The pure in heart The peacemakers The persecuted And the reviled And notice as well, that the blessings frequently involve reversals. The world is giving them one thing, but God is going to give them another.\nNow, this is important: these famous words are a mixture of encouragement and instruction.\nThat is, Jesus isn’t just giving us a TO-DO LIST in order to get as much blessing as possible. He’s not saying “Go out there and try harder to be poor, persecuted, hungry, mourners.”\nNow, Jesus IS instructing, more on that in a second. But he is first offering divine encouragement to those who are already in those situations.\nThe Beatitudes: An Interpretive Translation Here’s my interpretive translation of the Beatitudes. Follow along with each one if you’ve got a Bible in front of you.\nJesus is saying:\n(1) “Take heart! Things aren’t what they seem! If you lack resources and realize that God alone can save you, then you might not feel like a part of the Roman kingdom. But you’re a part of God’s Kingdom.” (2) “Be encouraged! If you bear and grieve the sufferings of the world, then the kings of the world probably won’t give you much comfort. But God, your true King, will. (3) Take heart! If you humbly and gently refuse to seek vengeance or power, then you probably won’t inherit much from the world’s kingdoms. But God will give you an inheritance in His Kingdom. (4) Be encouraged! If you pursue God’s will above all else, then you’ll probably go hungry in this world. But you will be satisfied in God’s Kingdom, where His will is obeyed. (5) Take heart! If you show mercy and compassion to a suffering world, you might not receive much mercy back! But you yourselves will be shown mercy by God. (6) Be encouraged! If you single-mindedly pursue God’s will, then you probably won’t experience the world’s glory. But you will experience God’s glory and presence. (7) Take heart! If you pursue reconciliation and reject violence, then you probably won’t reflect the character of this world. But you will reflect the character of God. (8) Take heart! Because when this world rejects you, insults you, lies about you, and persecutes you, then it may not look like it, but you’re in good company! You’re in the company of your Savior, Jesus Christ. Friends, if you’re here today and you’re at the bottom of this world, then I encourage you to cling to the divine promises of blessing in the Beatitudes.\nGod is in the process of making all things new – reversing every wrong in this world. Take heart.\nHowever, and perhaps this is uncomfortable to talk about, what if we’re NOT on this list?\nWhat if we’re NOT\npoor, mourning, meek, hungry, merciful, pure-hearted, peacemakers who are persecuted? What if we’re\nreasonably well-educated and wealthy, comfortable, powerful American Christians? How should we respond to the Beatitudes?\nWhile I DON’T think that the Beatitudes should be read like a TO-DO list,\nI DO think that the Beatitudes are an instructivechallenge to followers of Jesus.\nThere is a reason why the Beatitudes are at the beginning of Jesus’ quintessential sermon.\nIt’s almost like Jesus is saying,\n“OK, you want to follow me?\nYou want to be a part of my coming Kingdom? Then let’s get really clear on what this Kingdom is going to be like.\nIt’s not going to be the kind of Kingdom you’re used to in this world.\nYou know, the kind of kingdom where the wealthy, wise, and powerful get rewarded.\nInstead, in MY Kingdom, the people who get chewed up and spit out by the kingdoms of this world will be rewarded and honored.\nSO,\nif you want to be a part of my Kingdom, if you want to “get ahead” in my Kingdom, then you better show concrete concern for the oppressed, the marginalized, and the weak! And, as you do so, you’d better be prepared to end up among the oppressed and the marginalized, because the world is going to think you are out of your minds!”\nFear is NOT a Valid Excuse Brothers and sisters, remember:\nBecause God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world. But there is no escape clause from the rules of God’s Kingdom!\nThat is, you can’t just ignore Jesus and the Bible because you’re SCARED.\nBecause you’re scared of how a congregation is going to respond to your sermon, Because you’re scared of looking foolish, Because you’re scared of losing your job, Because you’re scared of a terrorist attack. It’s not that Jesus doesn’t care about your fears. He does.\nBut let’s not kid ourselves! FEAR is not a valid excuse for ignoring the Bible’s repeated commands for God’s people to show faithful concern for the kinds of people the world ignores and mistreats!\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;aligncenter\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;175\u0026rdquo;] Want to read more about what the Bible has to say about these kinds of issues? Read this book! (Affiliate Link)[/caption]\nApplication: Consistently Pro-Life, for the Unborn AND the Refugees So, let’s get practical here. How should we respond to these passages about God’s Upside-Down Kingdom?\nWe must show concrete concern for the powerless. And two recent issues come to mind, that I would be a coward not to mention.\nAbortion First, in light of the 44th March for Life held this past weekend, I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that we must continue to stand up for the unborn. Abortion is a gruesome evil. And like other forms of evil, it is complex – not easily eradicated.\nAs Christians, we must wage war against this evil. And that will involve caring not only for the unborn child, but also the mother, and the child after it is born, and the entire family.\nRepealing Roe v. Wade isn’t going to completely solve the problem.\nChristians will have to step up to the plate and be consistently pro-life in order to fix things.\nIf you’re passionate about this issue, I encourage you to check out the organization Anglicans for Life at AnglicansForLife.Org. So, first, we must stand up for the unborn.\nRefugees Second, given President Trump’s recent executive actions to halt the acceptance of all refugees to the USA, including a temporary moratorium on seven predominantly Muslim countries,\nI’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that, if we are to be consistently pro-life, we must also stand up for the refugees.\nNext to the unborn, refugees around the world – but especially from Syria – are among the most vulnerable and powerless people in the world.\nChristians should be standing up for and supporting these people. And, to their credit, many Christians are doing so.\nI’d encourage you to check out the great work being done by organizations like World Relief and We Welcome Refugees. Talk to me after the service if you’d like more ideas and reading recommendations, by the way.\nHowever, many Christians in this country are falling prey to the fear excuse.\nWe’re being tempted to turn away these vulnerable people because of the supposed risk of a terrorist attack.\nI’m here this morning to plead with you: Do not fall prey to this nonsense.\nEven if the fear were legitimate, it is no excuse for Christians not to show concrete love to the powerless.\nWhoever said that following Jesus would not involve any risks?\nWe dare not worship the American gods of comfort and security while neglecting to follow the True God’s commands.\nHowever, these fears of refugees are VASTLY overblown.\nAccording to a September 2016 Policy Analysis from the CATO institute,\n“the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year.” The chance of being murdered in a terrorist attack committed by an asylum-seeker is 1 in 2.73 billion per year. And “the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an illegal immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year.” For comparison: according to the National Safety Council, your chance of dying from a lightning strike is 1 in 174,426.\nThat means it’s about 20,868 times more likely that you will get killed by lightning than by a refugee terrorist attack.\nWhile we’re worried about astronomical odds, these people are dying. The death toll from the Syrian conflict is approaching half a million, including 50 thousand children.\nBrothers and sisters, please don’t mishear me. I’m not saying that the USA shouldn’t change anything about its policies. Surely there are many problems which need fixed.\nHowever, I beg you: please do not fall prey to the fear-mongering. Please think and reason as Christians first.\nAfter all, you can only give your “total allegiance” to one thing.\nJesus Christ will not settle for second place to the United States.\nSo, stand up for the unborn and the refugees, not to mention the countless other marginalized, oppressed, and powerless people around us.\nAnd I don’t even have time to get into how Christians should be concerned for religious liberties for all faiths. That’s a whole other sermon…\nBecause God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world. But, if our Gospel is true, then we of all people should be willing to put our lives and our reputations at risk for the sake of others – especially for the poor and the needy.\nClosing Prayer So, again, God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would transform us from the inside out\nSo that we would promote your justice So that we would embody your steadfast faithful love and so that we would humbly obey Your will, even if it costs us our reputations, and even if it costs us our lives. I ask that this transformation would begin with me, and that it would extend to the ends of the earth. In Jesus’ name. Amen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/getting-ahead-in-gods-upside-down-kingdom/","summary":"Your browser does not support the audio element.

In the broadly post-Kantian milieu, nineteenth-century thinkers such as Friedrich Schleiermacher, Albrecht Ritschl, and Adolf von Harnack defined religion essentially, anthropologically, and subjectively. That is, religion has a particular essence, and is in some manner inalienable from our humanity. The emphasis of this conception is on the experience of the religious subject, instead of the knowledge of religion’s object (let alone its reality). [1] It is this notion of religion that both Barth and Bonhoeffer challenged.\n(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: \u0026quot; Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?\u0026quot;)\nHowever, despite the challenge they issued to their shared intellectual heritage, Barth and Bonhoeffer appear to diverge on both the definition and, therefore, the critique of religion – at least during the stage of Bonhoeffer’s 1943-45 imprisonment. While Barth unleashed a thoroughgoing theological critique of religion as faithlessness [ Unglaube], he also insisted that humans were always and unavoidably religious. [2] Barth maintained that, despite the liabilities of religion, we cannot and should not be religion less because we are not truly godless. [3] Bonhoeffer, however, spoke in 1944-45 of a desirably “religionless Christianity.” [4] This, despite the fact that he ostensibly intended to carry forward Barth’s theological critique of religion – which was, in Bonhoeffer’s opinion, Barth’s “greatest merit” as a theologian. [5]\nWhether Barth and Bonhoeffer share a common theological critique of religion has been subject to intense scholarly debate. To answer this question, we need first to ask another: What did Barth and Bonhoeffer mean by the term “religion”? I propose that, although Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s definitions of religion diverge, their critiques of religion converge. Barth developed a systematic/dialectical concept of religion as self-justification, which the early Bonhoeffer inherited. However, in prison, Bonhoeffer developed a historical/psychological definition of religion as an inward and partial approach to human life. We must realize that these are two different definitions of religion, lest we compare apples to oranges, as it were, and conclude that Barth’s and Bonhoeffer’s critiques of religion also diverged.\nOnce we realize the divergent definitions, we can see the convergent critiques of a particular essence of religion: the self-justifying projection of a deity – a projection which calls for theological analysis. That is, for both Barth and Bonhoeffer, at the heart of “religion” is the impulse to posit and make room for a “God,” in order to secure our own identities by means of and over against this deity. Although religion, thus understood, is inescapable, it is not constitutive of our humanity.\n[[To continue reading, download the PDF: To Be or Not To Be Religious.]]\n\u0026mdash;Notes\u0026mdash;\n[1] See Christine Axt-Piscalar, “Liberal Theology in Germany,” in The Blackwell Companion to Nineteenth-Century Theology, ed.

And Merry Christmas!\nTogether, let us pray:\nO God, you make us glad by the yearly festival of the birth of your only Son Jesus Christ: Grant that we, who joyfully receive him as our Redeemer, may with sure confidence behold him when he comes to be our Judge; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.\nAlmighty God, who wonderfully created us in your own image and yet more wonderfully restored us through your Son Jesus Christ: grant that, as he came to share our humanity, so we may share the life of his divinity; who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.\nYou know, they say that Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. I’ve even heard it said that it’s the “hap-happiest season of all”!\nBut, can I take a poll real quick?\nPlease raise your hand if you’ve ever had a disappointing Christmas.\nI mean a Christmas that didn’t live up to your expectations. You wanted it to be filled with love, happiness, and peace, and instead all you got was stress, anxiety, and loneliness.\nHave you ever had a disappointing Christmas? I have.\nNow, why am I being such a downer? Isn’t this supposed to be a joyful occasion?\nI mean, joy, triumph, and exultation practically drip out of every song we’ve sung and every passage we’ve read this morning! Why talk about the disappointments of Christmas?\nWell, because we too often try to combat the disappointments of Christmas with shallow denial or escapism.\nWhen things go wrong at Christmas,\nwe tell the kids to shut up and turn the Christmas music up a little louder. We throw money at our problems. We withdraw into our shells, and delude ourselves into thinking that next year will be different. Or maybe, we’ve encountered so many disappointments, heartbreaks, and disasters in this world that we’ve given up hope completely.\nWe come to Church – perhaps just once a year, around Christmas – for the sake of relatives or nostalgia. But the story of Christ’s birth rings just as hollow as any other Christmas story.\nI mean, can we really sing “Joy to the World” in Aleppo, Syria?\nIn South Sudan?\nIn Berlin?\nIn the intensive care unit?\nIn our own troubled homes?\nYes, we can. In fact, we must.\nWe must sing Joy to the World – even through tears – in the deepest and darkest disappointments of this world. No matter how painful things get, we cannot celebrate Christmas by ignoring, denying, and detaching from the world around us.\nWhy?\nBecause, although we live in a deeply disappointing world, we do not worship a disappointing God.\nAlthough we frequently feel distant and detached from God and from one another, he is not distant or detached from us!\nInstead, he has dwelt among us – as one of us! – in order to bring us back into perfect relationship with Him, with each other, and with all of creation.\nAlthough we rebel against God, and run in the opposite direction – away from light and life into darkness and death – he does not abandon us. He does not keep us at arm’s length.\nNo, instead He dives from heaven’s heights into the muck and the mire of our sin- and death-stained world. He joins us in the thick of things, in order to bring us back to God.\nConsider the disappointing circumstances of his birth! We have thoroughly romanticized the nativity scene. Sure, there were glimpses of the extraordinary – such as the appearance of angels and the fact that Jesus was born to a virgin.\nBut when you consider that this is the arrival of the eternal and divine Son of God to the world he created, Christ’s birth is remarkably ordinary and humble – you may even call it disappointing, if you didn’t know any better.\nIt happened in a feeding trough, surrounded by animals and poor shepherds. He was born to poor parents, not yet fully wed! And this all took place in a tiny, po-dunk sheep town!\nThis?! This is Christ the King? Whom shepherds guard and angels sing? This is the eternal Son of God?\nYou mean, this baby in a feeding trough?\nHe is the heir of all things? The creator of heaven and earth?\nYou mean, this homeless itinerant preacher with a penchant for lepers, prostitutes, and tax-collectors?\nHe is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact of imprint of his nature?\nYou mean, this criminal hanging on a bloodstained Roman cross?\nHe upholds the universe by the word of his power?\nAre you sure?! Because at his birth, throughout his life, and at his death, he is surrounded by the outcasts of this world! By the broken bits that the universe churns out!\nAre you sure this is God? Are you sure this is how he saves the world? Yes. Although, I do understand that this is shocking.\nChristmas is shocking. It’s either a shocking disappointment or a shocking hope.\nAs we read in Hebrews, in these last days, God has spoken to us through his Son, Jesus Christ.\nBut what he has spoken can, at least for now, be rejected and ignored.\nConsider again the words of John 1:\nThe true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.\nWhy would we reject Jesus? Perhaps we’re not interested in such humble Savior. We’re interested in power, and we’re interested in staying in control.\nWe think that, despite life’s disappointments, we can fix this on our own. We can give our own lives some sense of meaning and purpose. We think we can save ourselves…\nBut we can’t save ourselves from Sin and Death. And it’s about time we admit that.\nThankfully, however, that baby born in Bethlehem can save us all – even those at the bottom of this world – because he himself went to the bottom, to the outcasts, to the borders, and to the grave.\nBut he didn’t stay there!\nHe rose again victorious over the grave.\nHis death put Death itself to death.\nAnd, as Hebrews 1 says, “After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.”\nAnd from there we await his return.\nThe Word who became flesh and made his dwelling among us will dwell with us once more, as Revelation 21 tells us.\nHe will wipe away every tear from our eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore.\nHow can we be a part of this hope? Not by rejecting Jesus, but by receiving him. As John 1 continues:\nBut to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.\nIf you have not yet received Jesus, entrusting your life to him as your Lord and Savior, then I beg you to do so this morning.\nAs we’ll sing in a bit, this is the meaning of Christmas! Christ was\nborn that we no more may die, born to raise us from the earth, born to give us second birth!\nRight now! He stands ready and willing to save you, to forgive you, and to welcome you into eternal life – if you will turn to him in repentance and faith.\nThat’s the response some of you are called to make this Christmas.\nWhat about the rest of us?\nWe are, all of us, called to worship the God who has dwelt among us in order to save us. We are, all of us, called to sing to the Lord a fresh, new song, for he has done marvelous things!\nIn the midst of the sorrows and disappointments of this world, with which our God is well-acquainted, we are, all of us, called to make a joyful noise to the Lord, to break forth into joyous songs and sing praises!\nAmen?\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/a-christmas-homily/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGood morning!

If you only have a minute to read about wealth, here\u0026rsquo;s my argument in a nutshell:\nOutline of My Argument Main Claim: American Christians should reduce their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor and oppressed. God is the firmest advocate for human flourishing. The pursuit of wealth is spiritually dangerous and crippling. Our culture’s inclinations toward upward financial mobility go against the message of the New Testament and the life of Christ. God is revealed in Scripture to have a special concern for the poor and the oppressed. Christians will be held accountable for how they treat the poor and the oppressed. Objections: This line of reasoning is advocating asceticism and is unbiblical. Christians have every right to keep what they have earned and to do what they wish with their excess funds. Because the poor are lazy, Christians should not feel pressured to give, in case their generosity is taken advantage of. Warrant: Christians want to remain true to Scripture and submit to God’s way of life in order to find satisfaction. (For more on Christianity, wealth, and poverty, see my topical study on what the book of Proverbs has to teach us about poverty.)\nStill interested in reading about this contentious topic? Continue below.\nIntroduction In our current context of wealth and poverty existing side by side in a milieu of materialistic consumerism, the Christian gospel of denying ourselves and making much of God is being abandoned for the American gospel of denying others and making much of ourselves.\nAmerican Christians have become content to live a baptized version of the American dream, a hollow faith that is about maximizing your earthly portfolio once your salvation is secured.\nMy main contention is that Christians in the United States should lower their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor. In doing so, they will remain faithful to Scripture and discover a more satisfactory way of life.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t That Asceticism? At this point, some may claim that I am trying to advocate for a form of asceticism.\nWhile my claim might appear that way when viewed through our culture’s thick lens of materialistic consumerism, I believe that I am actually advocating for a more satisfactory way of life.\nGod is revealed in Scripture to be the firmest advocate for human flourishing. That is, he desires what is truly best for his creation and his people. He created everything to be structurally good and is currently in the process of redeeming the universe from its directional digression away from its intended God-exalting purposes.\nThings like hunger and poverty are on the chopping block in this redemptive mission. The standard to which everything is being drawn is not an eternally unsatisfying state of Spartan living and ascetic suffering. It is the eternally satisfying and rich state of glorifying God like creation was intended to.\nI am advocating for a return to standards of living necessary for human flourishing, realizing that this standard will vary greatly from person to person and culture to culture. [1] The problem is that what appears to be the standard of human flourishing to us is often quite damaging.\nFalse Wealth: The Dangers of Materialism The Bible pulls no punches in describing the dangers of a materialistic pursuit of wealth.\nWhile money is nowhere declared to be intrinsically evil, Scripture makes it clear that we are all sin-stained creatures prone to greed and self-justification, and that an abundance of wealth and possessions makes it very hard to rise above our idolatrous inclinations and serve God well. [2]\nIn addition, although it exceeds the scope of this essay, a strong argument can be made that our society’s pragmatic commitment to “getting ahead” is destroying our ability to experience genuine delight in the small things in life which do not increase our bottom line. [3]\nDespite our initial reactions, it appears as though what our culture is encouraging us to pursue is actually quite destructive to our ability to serve God well and genuinely enjoy life.\nDownward Mobility While the culture around us is calling us towards a lifestyle of upward financial mobility, “the emphasis of the New Testament lies not on the acquisition side of things…but on sacrifice and divestiture”. [4]\nThe incarnation of Jesus is a clear example of the kind of God we serve, one who emptied himself of the riches of heaven in order to take on human flesh and demonstrate a fiercely sacrificial obedience that took him all the way to the cross. Although there is a big gap between kenosis and a Christian’s obligation to give to the poor, it nonetheless serves as an example of the kind of living we are called to by the gospel.\nAt the very least, it is reasonable to say that the life of Jesus the Messiah was an atrocious failure when judged by our society’s standards of materialistic consumerism, and yet as Christians, we would all (presumably) confess that we are called to follow his example.\nAgain, keep in mind that we are not all called to live ascetically and to spurn the legitimate pleasures of this life. However, one would be hard pressed to find biblical support for our culture’s view of wealth and success.\nWhat About My Rights? At this point, we are all tempted to rebuff and claim that we have every right to keep all of what we have “earned” and do as we wish with our excess funds.\nHowever, the Bible presents us with the uncomfortable truth that everything we “own” is in fact owned by God and has been given to us to steward well. [5]\nA prosperous Christian is not an intrinsic oxymoron, and there are examples in Scripture of wealthy people who seem to have genuinely loved God and served him well. However, there is no example of a person who selfishly viewed their possessions as their own, lived a lifestyle of extravagant wealth, and honored God by doing so.\nEven more uncomfortable is the fact that, if God expects us to follow his example in our stewardship of his resources, then we are faced with a strong biblical mandate to give generously to the poor and fight for their justice.\nAren\u0026rsquo;t the Poor Just Lazy? In my own experience, our culture’s stereotype of the poor consigns their condition to laziness. Evangelical Christians seem to use this stereotype to effectively avoid giving generously to the poor under the pretense of good stewardship and not wanting their giving to be taken advantage of by lazy individuals.\nWith regards to being taken advantage of, Christians should perhaps be the most willing people to be taken advantage of in their giving. After all, we frequently take advantage of God’s grace in our own lives, and if he modeled the same attitude to us that we display to the poor, we would be in a sorry state of affairs. [6]\nHowever, the biblical picture of the poor emphasizes their destitution, need, lack of resources, and suffering under oppression. [7]\nIn contrast to our frequently apathetic response, God seems to have a bias to the poor. Karl Barth claimed that “ God always takes his stand unconditionally and passionately on this side and this side alone: against the lofty and on behalf of the lowly; against those who enjoy right and privilege and on behalf of those who are denied it and deprived of it”. [8]\nConsider the biblical account.\nGod intervened to save his people from the oppression and poverty they suffered in at the hands of the Egyptians. [9] He made his frustration at his people’s improper treatment of the impoverished known through the prophets. [10] Jesus the Messiah cited his own mission as one that was inextricably tied to the poor and oppressed. [11] The final judgment will be executed (at least partially so) with regards to the treatment (or mistreatment) of the poor. [12] Scripture makes it abundantly clear that God’s heart is for the impoverished, destitute, and oppressed.\nConclusion As Christians, we must take seriously the words of our Savior that how we treat “the least of these” has serious import on how we treat and serve Christ himself.\nWe must take the whole witness of Scripture into account and realize that the God we serve and whose resources we steward shows special concern for the poor and oppressed.\nWe must be willing to acknowledge that our culture’s values of materialistic consumerism run against the grain of the gospel of “sacrifice and divestiture,” opening our eyes to the spiritual dangers of pursuing wealth and possessions.\nAbove all, perhaps, we must be willing to eschew the idolatry in our hearts and trust that our Heavenly Father knows what is best for us and desires to see us truly flourish in our sacrifice and generosity.\nThen, and only then, will we be able to reduce our extravagant standards of living, give to the poor from our excess resources out of genuine generosity, and flourish as human beings by fulfilling our primary purpose: exalting and making much of our Maker.\n(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: \u0026quot; Theology in Outline: What do I believe?\u0026quot;)\nBibliography Sider, Ronald. \u0026ldquo;God and the Poor.\u0026rdquo; Sider, Ronald.

Before that, I went to a Christian college. Before that, I went to a Christian high school, and a Christian middle school. Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a Christian home. Oh, also: I’m the world’s worst sports fan.\nI’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it. Every week, they’re like, “Josh, did you see the game?!” “Josh, are you going to watch the game?”\nAnd I’m like, “Game? What game? I don’t even know which sport’s season it is!”\nWorld’s. worst. sports fan. I’m telling you.\nThe one redeeming quality about my sports fandom is that I’ve stuck with one team through thick and thin: the University of Michigan Wolverines. Go Blue!\nNow, I know that the rivalry between the Wolverines and the Ohio State Buckeyes is but a pale imitation of the rivalry between Alabama and Auburn down here. But up North, this rivalry was and is a big deal.\nAnd it was really interesting, back when I was in middle school and high school, to observe what would happen each year in November when the Wolverines and the Buckeyes went at it.\nI’m from Toledo, OH, which is on the border with Michigan, so the fan split was about 50/50 – Wolverines on one side, Buckeyes on the other.\nAnd each year, on the day after the big game, you could tell who the true fans were…\nIt was the people still cheering for the team that lost.\nWhy not the winning fans? Weren’t they just as legit?\nWell, maybe. Perhaps they were legitimate, lifelong fans. But, on the other hand, they could just be cheering for the winning team because they won, right?\nThey could, in other words, just be bandwagon fans.\nBandwagon fans are the worst. Right? I mean, you can’t trust them. Sure, they look like a die-hard fan now, when the team is doing well. But, when things get rough, when those wins stop coming, they disappear! On to the next team, at least as long as they keep on winning…\nBandwagon fans. Those people are the worst.\nBut, you know, if we’re honest with ourselves, we tend to ride a lot of bandwagons in life, and not just in sports.\nWe ride the bandwagon when it comes to:\nHow we speak What we wear What we read What we listen to What we watch What we eat and drink We ride bandwagons when it comes to our friends. Our hobbies.\nAnd, if we’re really honest with ourselves, our faith.\nWe are Bandwagon Christians Hear me out. Hear me out. I’m not saying that there are no genuine followers of Jesus Christ here.\nWhat I am saying is that, to some extent, being a Christian is built into the very fabric of our lives. I am, after all, speaking here at a Christian school, which meets in a church!\nAnd me? I’m no better. I’m a student at a Christian school, and always have been! I’ve been around Christians my entire life!\nNow, is being around Christians a bad thing? Should we all stop going to church?\nNo! That’s not what I’m saying.\nWhat I’m saying is that, if we’re not careful, following Jesus Christ will be just another thing we do to go with the flow, to follow the crowd.\nFollowing Jesus will become just a matter of convenience, instead of devotion.\nAnd, just like any bandwagon fan, the danger for us bandwagon Christians is that, when things get tough, we’ll be exposed for who we really are – followers of ourselves, instead of followers of Jesus.\nFriends, we’re all, to some extent, bandwagon Christians.\nAnd here’s the bad news:\nJesus Doesn’t Want Bandwagon Follower s! Turn with me, if you’ve got your Bible, to Luke, chapter 14. Verse 25.\nNow, for a bit of context, Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem. You know, where he’s about to be tortured and killed. And he’s got this big ol’ crowd of people with him.\nI want you to imagine that we – all of us – are in that group of people, following Jesus.\nAnd Jesus is about to drop a truth-bomb on all of us, that he is not interested in bandwagon followers. He doesn’t want them.\nWhat does he want? Let’s read to find out. Verse 25 begins:\n25 Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them,26 “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.\nJesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers. Instead, he wants your ultimate loyalty. See, he’s not urging us to get really angry at our family. And he’s not telling you to hate yourself or beat yourself up.\nNo, instead the word “hate” here emphasizes a decision to be made: who are you going to be loyal to, above all else?\nIn that culture, your family was your source of identity. You were supposed to be loyal to them, no matter what.\nIs Jesus saying that families are bad? No. Not at all.\nBut he is saying that, for his followers, he needs to be even more important to them than whatever else they give their loyalty to.\nSo, what is that for you and I, today? Is it your family? Or is it your friends? Is it your popularity, or the way you look? Is it your athletic or musical ability?\nWhere do you find your identity? What gets your ultimate loyalty?\nIs it Jesus? Or is it ______?\nJesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers; he wants your ultimate loyalty.\nHe also wants your life. Let’s read verse 27:\n27 Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.\nJesus is saying that his followers are to live as if they’re condemned to die. Pick up your electric chair and follow Jesus!\nYes, it sounds gruesome. But think about it. If you were really condemned to be executed soon, how would you live differently?\nYou see, death has a weird way of revealing what’s really important to us. If you knew you were going to die soon, would you spend your time chasing after status, money, or fame?\nI hope not.\nJesus wants us to live differently than the world around us. He wants us to live in a way that screams to the world “There is more to life than being powerful! There is more to life than being popular! There is more to life than being pretty!”\nAnd, if we live that way, we might suffer for it. We might lose friends, money, and influence. We might even get ourselves killed.\nBut Jesus wants our loyalty, and he wants our lives.\nOK, how do we get there? The first step is to count the cost. Let’s read verses 28-32:\n28 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? 29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, 30 saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’\n31 Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? 32 And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.\nIf Jesus wants our loyalty and our lives, then it’s a good idea to stop and consider what we’re getting ourselves into before we claim to be his followers!\nWe need to count the cost, just like the tower-builder or the king going to war.\nBut, did you catch something else? We’re not just supposed to count the cost for no good reason. No! It’s supposed to teach us something.\nWe’re supposed to count the cost, and to realize that we don’t have what it takes! Otherwise, Jesus says, we’re going to get embarrassed if we try and rush into things on our own. We don’t have what it takes.\nWhat a motivational chapel message this is turning out to be! Hate your family and hate yourself, because you don’t have what it takes! Amen?!\nLet’s read one more verse, verse 33:\n33 So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.\nFriends, it might not feel like it, but we’ve actually arrived at the good news. Remember, the bad news is that we’re all riding the bandwagon, and that Jesus doesn’t want bandwagon followers.\nThe good news is that Jesus died for bandwagon followers, like you and me. Jesus rose again from the dead for bandwagon followers, like you and me.\nAnd Jesus offers a new life to bandwagon followers, like you and me.\nWhen our loyalty runs out, he remains faithful to us. When we fail, over and over again, to give our own lives meaning, he gives us the love, the purpose, and the meaning in life that we’re searching for.\nWhen we come up short, Jesus carries us through.\nBecause no, we don’t have what it takes. But he does.\nAnd he delights to give us what it takes to follow him into new, eternal life.\nSo, even though it’s incredibly hard to get off the bandwagon and pick up our cross, even though it’s really hard to give Jesus complete control over our lives, and to give him ultimate loyalty, above everything and everyone else, even though it’s the hardest, most difficult thing we will ever do, Following Jesus is also the easiest, most joyful thing we will ever do.\nIt’s easier than living life on the bandwagon. Why?\nBecause you don’t have to lie anymore, pretending you’re a follower of Jesus when really you’re the one calling the shots.\nYou don’t have to exhaust yourself trying to give your own life meaning. It doesn’t all depend on you and your effort and your strength and your skills…\nNO, it depends on your Heavenly Father, who created you.\nIt depends on Jesus Christ, who died and rose again for you.\nIt depends on the Holy Spirit, who strengthens and empowers you to live life God’s way.\nSo, what does jumping off the bandwagon to follow Jesus really look like? Does it have to be this super-emotional, tear-filled conversion experience?\nWell, maybe. But I think that, for most of us, it’s going to look a lot more boring.\nHere’s why: we’re never going to become the people who pick up their crosses and renounce all they have, if we’re not becoming that kind of a person today.\nThat is, we need to pick up the little crosses each day. We need to say the small goodbyes to all we have each day.\nWhat’s this look like? I think it looks like taking more risks for Jesus.\nYou know, it’s crazy. I think I’m more afraid of standing up to peer pressure than standing up to martyrdom!\nIt’s like, sure, I’ll take a bullet for you, Jesus. But please don’t make me call out my friend for that inappropriate joke,\nSure, I’ll go on that missions trip. But please don’t make me skip the game to go to church.\nSure, I’ll risk my life to spread the gospel. But please don’t make me risk my reputation by reaching out to that weirdo.\nAre we willing to risk our popularity?\nAre we willing to risk our athletic accomplishments?\nAre we willing to risk our everyday comfort?\nWhat risk is Jesus asking you to take for him right now, today? Maybe it’s a conversation you need to have.\nMaybe it’s an addiction or habit you need to break.\nMaybe it’s a fear you need to let go of.\nMaybe it’s admitting that, although you really are a Christian, you’ve been riding the bandwagon, and you need to get off.\nMaybe it’s admitting that, although you look like a Christian, you’ve only been riding the bandwagon, and you really aren’t following Jesus at all.\nThat’s a very difficult thing to admit.\nBut I promise you, you’re better off admitting it now than hiding it for years.\nJesus knows who you really are. Jesus knows who we really are, all of us.\nHe doesn’t want bandwagon followers. He doesn’t want people who think they have what it takes to give their lives meaning.\nBut Jesus is waiting with open arms to catch us, if we’re willing to jump off the bandwagon and follow him.\nAre we willing to take the leap? To take the risk?\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/following-jesus-beyond-the-bandwagon/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(A chapel message in a Christian school.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few things you should know about me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI am a student at a \u003cem\u003eChristian\u003c/em\u003e seminary.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBefore that, I went to a \u003cem\u003eChristian\u003c/em\u003e college.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBefore that, I went to a \u003cem\u003eChristian\u003c/em\u003e high school, and a \u003cem\u003eChristian\u003c/em\u003e middle school.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBefore that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a \u003cem\u003eChristian\u003c/em\u003e home.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, also: I’m \u003cstrong\u003ethe world’s worst sports fan\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m serious.

On March 24, our third class period on Dietrich Bonhoeffer, our second question for discussion read as follows:\n“What is religion for Bonhoeffer? What are its anthropological manifestations (in Bonhoeffer’s day)? In what ways is Bonhoeffer\u0026rsquo;s understanding of religion similar to, and different from, that of Barth?”\nHaving taken Malysz\u0026rsquo;s Fall 2014 seminar on Karl Barth, I was intrigued by the question. We only spent a few minutes on the topic in class, focusing on how Bonhoeffer’s definition of religion focuses on a “necessary God of the gaps,” but I wrote down the following questions for further consideration:\nIs there a tension in how Barth and Bonhoeffer describe “religion,” or an underlying harmony? Barth speaks of boundary, Bonhoeffer of finding God at the center. Are they getting at the same thing? What is the relationship between Barth’s “No-God” and Bonhoeffer’s God as “stopgap”? It has been over a year since that class discussion, but these questions are still on my mind. I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that Barth\u0026rsquo;s and Bonhoeffer\u0026rsquo;s theological critiques of religion can provide resources for the Church today.\nIn addition to that class discussion question, Tom Greggs\u0026rsquo; Theology Against Religion: Constructive Dialogues with Bonhoeffer and Barth[affiliate links throughout]has been an enormous catalyst for this project.\nAfter graduating from Beeson in December, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in historical/systematic theology. If all goes well, I\u0026rsquo;d like to expand my Barth/Bonhoeffer project this semester into a doctoral project - perhaps focusing on the relationship between Barth\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;No-God\u0026rdquo; and Bonhoeffer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;God-as-stopgap,\u0026rdquo; or on the relationship between Barth\u0026rsquo;s and Bonhoeffer\u0026rsquo;s theological interpretation[s] of Scripture and their theological critiques of religion.\nMy Reading List Anyway, with the help of Michael DeJonge, Clifford Green, Garrett Green, Tom Greggs, and Paul Dafydd Jones, I have developed the following reading list for this semester\u0026rsquo;s directed study:\nPrimary Sources: BARTH, Karl. On Religion: The Revelation of God as the Sublimation of Religion.

To our aspirations as human beings, and especially to our aspirations as ministers of Christ’s Church.\nJames \u0026amp; John: Fishermen No More? You see, James started off as a mere fisherman. An admirable one, to be sure, because he and his brother John answered Jesus’ call in Mark 1. They left behind their father, their family, and – they grew to hope! – their family’s fishing profession.\nJames was off on a new adventure, hopeful and headstrong. So much so that, along with his brother John, he earned the nickname “ Son of Thunder”! Coming from the Son of Man, that’s no small compliment!\nBut their headstrong passion proved to be a weakness as well. In Luke 9, after getting rejected in Samaria, the Sons of Thunder offer to call fire down from heaven to consume the Samaritan village! This earns them a stern rebuke from Jesus.\nAnd, even more famously, they approached Jesus with the following request in Mark 10:37:\nGrant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.\nPrinces? Or Fishermen? Now, their request is, in effect: “O King Jesus, would you please make us princes?”\nAnd, granted, this is Apocryphal, but I imagine Jesus putting his arms around them and saying the following:\n“Princes? Princes?! Boys, if I had wanted princes, I would have called princes! But, I don’t need princes!\nNo, no, no. What I need are new fishermen! And that’s why I’ve called you!”\nYou see, James had been hoping for a new position. And instead he received his old profession – transformed!\nJames was no longer to be a mere fisherman, but a fisher of men. And not even just a fisher of men like Jeremiah 16 spoke of – for there the fishermen and hunters are instruments of judgment and exile.\nNo! Instead, James was to go fishing with, go fishing for Jesus, to bring people back from exile.\nNow, undoubtedly, this is a step up from fishing for literal fish. Or is it?\nNot necessarily. At least, not in the world’s eyes.\nThe Death of St. James the Apostle Here’s Jesus’ actual answer to the “prince” request:\nJesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”\nAnd they said to him, “We are able.”\nAnd Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”\nNow, granted, this isn’t one of the assigned lectionary passages for today, but I’d like us to look at the beginning of Acts 12:\nAbout that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. He killed James the brother of John with the sword, and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also.\nSwept aside, in just one verse! I doubt that sort of an abrupt, violent end awaited most of the fishermen working for Zebedee’s family business.\nWas it worth it? Was it worth it? Did James receive any sort of a promotion, after all?\nOf course, we know the right answer. But do we live it out?\nAre we thankful, are we satisfied with our roles as servants within Christ\u0026rsquo;s Church?\nAre we willing to be “just” fishermen, even if it costs us our ambitions? Even if it costs us our lives?\nBy God’s grace, I hope so.\nBy God’s grace, may we – with the Apostle James – be able to confess the final words of Psalm 34 with open eyes, and open hearts. Perhaps it will help to imagine the following words on the dying Apostle’s lips:\nMany are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all. He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken. Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-feast-of-st-james-the-apostle-a-homily-for-ministers/","summary":"Readings: Psalm 34; Jeremiah 16:14-21; Mark 1:14-20\nLike so many other feast days – scheduled, as they are, on the days of the namesakes’ deaths – the feast day of St. James the Apostle is a strong rebuke to our aspirations.

Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s a good first step, but another one is necessary.\nYou - and I - need to be willing to take ownership for the Church\u0026rsquo;s failures.

We are concrete sinners, each corrupt, selfish, and violent.\nThe moment we attempt to distance ourselves from \u0026ldquo;those sinners over there,\u0026rdquo; we open ourselves to the risk of committing the very worst sins against others - within and without the Church.\nOnly when we Christians begin to take ownership for the failings of the Church (of which we are a part) can the Church adopt its most successful posture: repentance.\n\u0026ldquo;Were the Church to appear before men as a Church under judgement; did it know of no other justification save that which is in judgement; did it believe in the stone of stumbling and rock of offence, instead of being offended and scandalized at it; then, with all its failings and offences - and certainly one day purified of some of them - it would be the Church of God.\u0026rdquo; ~ Karl Barth, The Epistle to the Romans, 370.\nRepentance requires the realization that we are under judgement.\nWhen the Church self-righteously condemns the world, it refuses repentance. But the answer is not to join the world and self-righteously condemn the Church!

Then, it led to the secret summer firing of a professor. I reacted on my blog. Christianity Today picked it up. As well as a local newspaper. The same day the Christianity Today piece ran, the President \u0026ldquo;resigned.\u0026rdquo; So did the Vice President of Student Life. You know what? It\u0026rsquo;s a long story, just read it here if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. Between my original blogpost and my \u0026quot; final farewell,\u0026quot; I tried to take a pretty active role in the student protests against what was going on at CU.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to think we made a bit of a difference - perhaps in slowing things down enough to let professors find jobs elsewhere before they got fired. Heck, we even made it into The New York Times. (Although, I will say: I\u0026rsquo;m embarrassed of the picture they chose for the article.)\nHowever, in the long run, we failed.\nCedarville is now a much different place than when I arrived. What\u0026rsquo;s more, I became so entangled in the mess that I arrived to seminary with some burn wounds - from a prophetic fire that burnt a bit too hot.\nI\u0026rsquo;m thankful for my time at Cedarville, however.\nGod has been healing those wounds. Beeson Divinity School and Anglicanism have both been balms to my spirit. And, with the healing has come the realization that I would not be who I am today were it not for my four years in Cedarville, Ohio.\nMany of the lessons I learned there were sealed with blood, sweat, and tears - as it were. However, those kinds of lessons are often the most important and enduring.\nBy God\u0026rsquo;s grace, I hope to carry forward into my future ministry a combination of prophetic fire and patient faithfulness in the face of injustice and suffering.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing, though: I\u0026rsquo;m worried about the other members of the \u0026ldquo;Cedarville Diaspora.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Cedarville ex-pats\u0026rdquo;?

They\u0026rsquo;ve miraculously landed on their feet, and I\u0026rsquo;ve witnessed God\u0026rsquo;s powerful work of redemption through them in their current careers and ministries.\nNo, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the alumni who got burned by fundamentalism and may have already thrown out the Christian baby with the fundamentalist bathwater. Or perhaps they\u0026rsquo;re seriously considering doing so.\nSee, God has blessed me with a wonderful seminary and church community in which to grow and heal after Cedarville. Without those things, I don\u0026rsquo;t know where I\u0026rsquo;d be after the awful ending to my Christian college experience.\nOthers, however, may be feeling very lonely and angry right now.\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s you, or if you know someone to whom this applies, would you let me know if there\u0026rsquo;s any way I can help you?\nI\u0026rsquo;ll gladly listen to you vent.

I get paid if you make a purchase.) Seth Godin, bald marketing extraordinaire, is convinced that a paradigm shift has taken place. I\u0026rsquo;ll quote from his annotated table of contents (which, by the way, I wish all books had):\nWe have gone from two teams (management and labor) to a third team, the linchpins. These are people who own their own means of production, who can make a difference, lead us, and connect us. The death of the factory means that the entire system we have built our lives around is now upside down. This is either a huge opportunity or a giant threat. Revolutions are frightening because the new benefits sometimes lag behind the old pain. This time, the opportunity is to bring your best self to the marketplace and be rewarded for it (vii).\nFor the past few generations, we\u0026rsquo;ve grown used to the implicit deal: If you go to school, learn how to follow instructions, work hard, and show up on time, we\u0026rsquo;ll take care of you.\nBut, at least in many sectors, the bargain has fallen apart.\nSo, Godin advises us to become linchpins in whatever industry we find ourselves. We must treat our work as art, and combine a variety of skills to address complex situations.\nWe must be able to figure out what to do next, without it being spelled out for us in an instruction manual.\nOK, great. But what does this have to do with CHURCH? I believe pastors are uniquely situated to be linchpins. They are the leaders of a largely volunteer organization. And, Pastoral Epistles notwithstanding, there is no instruction manual (God forbid we treat the Bible like an instruction manual!).\nSo they must treat their work as art. If they just phone it in and serve their time, they\u0026rsquo;ll be left with only the people who phone it in and serve their time as church members!\nI believe Christians are uniquely situated to be linchpins in their workplaces. I plan to write more about this in future posts, but it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous how much of the self-help advice out there these days aligns with the things Christians should be the very best at!\nA bunch of Godin\u0026rsquo;s advice centers around treating other people as full human beings, and on giving freely without the expectation of debt or compensation (See chapters \u0026ldquo;The Powerful Culture of Gifts\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Culture of Connection\u0026rdquo;).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but that sounds familiar.\nAs pastors focus on leading by example - by being linchpins themselves - they could start explicit conversations about the connections between worship on Sunday and work (which should also be worship) on the other six days.\nFinally, I believe that each church is uniquely situated to be a linchpin in its community. What if churches were known for showing artful, personal, and prodigal love to their communities, without expectation of increased attendance on a Sunday morning?\nWhat if we were seeker-sensitive, without selling out to the \u0026ldquo;latest\u0026rdquo; corporate and marketing strategies (which, often enough, rely upon the old paradigm)?\nWhat if, especially in North America, we stopped complaining about \u0026ldquo;persecution,\u0026rdquo; and started creatively taking advantage of the situations in which we find ourselves?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers to these questions, but I\u0026rsquo;m convinced they\u0026rsquo;re worth asking!\nGodin is convinced that people are starving for personal connection in a world filled with faceless factories and multinational corporations.

And, if we\u0026rsquo;re honest with ourselves, fear can play a large role in what/whom we worship.\nFor example, perhaps we worship God out of a fear of going to hell, or a fear of our inherited religion being wrong. We secretly worry that, like Donald Miller\u0026rsquo;s father accuses him in the movie Blue Like Jazz, we \u0026quot; only believe that stuff \u0026lsquo;cuz [we]\u0026rsquo;re afraid to hang out with people that don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026quot;\nOr perhaps we don\u0026rsquo;t worship God - and instead worship a god of our choice/invention - because we\u0026rsquo;re afraid of the implications of God\u0026rsquo;s existence.\nNow, there is, I\u0026rsquo;m persuaded, a holy fear. A salutary reverence and awe in the face of the divine.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about here, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the paralyzing fear - the cold sweat, the white knuckles, the tension headaches.\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about the same kind of fear as Seth Godin:\nThe power of fear Fear will push you to avert your eyes.\nFear will make you think you have nothing to say.\nIt will create a buzz that makes it impossible to meditate\u0026hellip;\nor it will create a fog that makes it so you can do nothing but meditate.\nFear seduces us into losing our temper.\nand fear belittles us into accepting unfairness.\nFear doesn\u0026rsquo;t like strangers, people who don\u0026rsquo;t look or act like us, and most of all, the unknown.\nIt causes us to carelessly make typos, or obsessively look for them.\nFear pushes us to fit in, so we won\u0026rsquo;t be noticed, but it also pushes us to rebel and to not be trustworthy, so we won\u0026rsquo;t be on the hook to produce.\nIt is subtle enough to trick us into thinking it isn\u0026rsquo;t pulling the strings, that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, that it\u0026rsquo;s not the cause of, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen in doubt, look for the fear.\nCourage isn\u0026rsquo;t the absence of fear. It\u0026rsquo;s knowing how to deal with fear. And, for me, the first step toward dealing with my fears is frankly admitting them.\nI\u0026rsquo;m scared, because I don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s next after I graduate from Beeson in December. I\u0026rsquo;m scared, because the thing I\u0026rsquo;ve felt called to for the longest time - getting a PhD in systematic theology - seems like an impractical pipe dream. I\u0026rsquo;m scared, because I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ll get into a PhD program. And, if I don\u0026rsquo;t, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how I\u0026rsquo;ll react to not being able to rely upon good grades for self-worth. Thankfully, none of these fears prevent me from being faithful with the day I\u0026rsquo;ve been given - today. The greatest failure would be to use fears of the future as an excuse for present faithlessness.\nSo, what are you afraid of? How are you dealing with those fears? Have you admitted them to anyone?

For those looking to strengthen the lower back and unable to use these traditional exercises the swing may be just the thing they’re looking for\nThanks to the full-body movement of the swing, you really don\u0026rsquo;t need to use a lot of weight to feel a difference. For example, I\u0026rsquo;ve been squatting 225 lbs. in maintenance mode recently, and after the first day of kettlebell swings with a 35 lb. kettlebell, my glutes and hamstrings were more sore than they\u0026rsquo;d been in months!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been very impressed with the results of a basic kettlebell workout, and it will enable me to get exercise at home during the semester, when going to the gym is more of a stretch.\nWould you like to give kettlebell swings a try? First, learn the proper form and then look for a kettlebell to give it a try.\nFor the CliffsNotes version, here\u0026rsquo;s the Tim Ferriss blogpost on the matter. For a more in-depth approach, BreakingMuscle.com, in addition to their article on why the kettlebell swing is such a great exercise, has this piece on how to do the perfect kettlebell swing.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re more of a visual learner, here\u0026rsquo;s a helpful instructional video from Eric Moss:\n[embed]http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_XjJjLc7NE[/embed]\nWhat weight should you start with? I began with a 35 lb. (16 kg.). Kettlebells USA has one of the best guides on choosing a starting weight, based upon your gender and current fitness level.\nWhat brand of kettlebell should you purchase? I went with Sweethome\u0026rsquo;s budget pick: the CAP Cast Iron Competition Weight Kettlebell. But, the in-depth review of different brands by Mark Bixby at Sweethome can\u0026rsquo;t be beat. I like the CAP, but I now agree with his assessment that the grip tears up your hands a bit on one-handed excercises.\nGive two-handed kettlebell swings a try!

Her stunning beauty?\nWhat about their relationship? Is the wedding great because of the intensity of their love for one another? Their glorious dreams for the future? The optimism of this moment between them?\nWhat is it that makes a wedding great?\nI guess, if most of us had to pick, we’d say that a wedding is great if the bride is happy. Right? I mean, even if the weather stinks, the singers are off-key, and the sermon is just absolutely awful – if the bride is happy, everything is OK. Right?\nWhich is a great reminder that weddings are about people, not performances.\nHowever, I’m here today to tell you all that, sure, you can have a good wedding if the bride is happy.\nBut, if you want a really great wedding – if you want a really great marriage – then it’s really all about the groom.\nGreat weddings, might I even say heavenly weddings, are all about the groom. Now, either you’re not listening or I’ve probably upset you!\nReally? Has the preacher lost his mind? Is he some sort of chauvinist pig?\nThis is the bride’s big day! That’s why her outfit is more impressive! That’s why we all stand when the bride walks down the aisle!\nAre we really going to take this moment away from her and say that it’s all about this handsome chump here?\nWell, no.\nHeavenly weddings are all about the groom, but you (gestures to the groom) better not use this sermon as an excuse for anything resembling male chauvinism!\nBecause, for one thing, I’m an egalitarian!\nAnd, for another, I’m not talking about you (gestures to groom), her (to bride) bridegroom, but rather to Christ, our (gestures to everyone) bridegroom.\nGreat weddings, and great marriages, are all about Christ, our Bridegroom. Take a glance at the Bible readings on your order of service everyone.\nDid you catch the names on the wedding invite in Revelation 19? We’re not invited there to this wedding, of this woman to this man, but the wedding of the Church to Christ himself!\nThis is the same marriage Paul speaks of in Ephesians 5. In both passages, the Groom, Christ, takes center stage.\nYou see, in the ancient Jewish culture out of which the Bible came, weddings were done a bit differently.\nModern weddings often center around the arrival of the bride to her groom, but these ancient Jewish weddings really hinged on the arrival of the groom to his bride.\nFirst, what would happen is the groom would pay the bride’s father her bride price.\nAfter this, the couple was betrothed – legally joined together, although not physically, for they still were not fully married.\nInstead, they went their separate ways. He went to prepare their future living quarters as an addition to his father’s household. She went back to her father’s household to prepare herself – including the preparation of her beautiful wedding dress.\nAfter the groom had completed their home, he would gather his friends to go and get his bride. She and her companions would have a ballpark idea of when he would come, but the exact hour was a surprise. So, the bridal party had to stay ready.\nThis is the scene we read in Matthew 25, where things went wrong. Five members of the bridal party were ready for the bridegroom to arrive, but the other five were not ready to join the evening’s lamp-lit procession.\nIdeally, the bride and all her friends and family would be awake and ready to join the groom on the journey back to his father’s household and their new living quarters. Once there, the real party began!\nWhich, by the way, if things have sounded real intense up to this point, let me assure you: these people knew how to party! The wedding celebration would go on for days and days, launching the couple into their new life together.\nNow, why in the world am I telling you all this? I mean, first I steal the bride’s thunder, and then I give you a Jewish history lesson?!\nHere’s why (looks directly at bride and groom): your wedding, and your marriage to each other, finds its true meaning and glory as a part of Christ’s Bride – the Church – preparing herself for the Bridegroom’s return.\nGreat weddings and marriages are all about the Bridegroom. What does that mean for you? Well, as we read in Ephesians 5, it means you are to love each other sacrificially and humbly.\nAfter all, our Bridegroom died for us. He cleanses us from sin. And he sets us apart as his holy people. Will your marriage be an image of this kind of love for each other?\nLook around the room, you two.\nNow look at each other.\nI think it’s safe to say that you will each bring the other more joy than anyone else in this room. However, I think it’s also safe to say that you will cause each other more pain than anyone else in this room.\nBecause you are sinners.\nYou each, like us all, have fallen short of the glory of God. And marriage is about to make you especially aware of your spouse’s sinful flaws!\nThankfully, though, that’s not the end of the story. Thankfully, your marriage can point beyond itself, and therefore be truly heavenly.\nFor you both have been bought by the very blood of Christ – a steep bride price if there ever was one!\nYou have both been betrothed to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who is preparing a place for you both in his Father’s household.\nAnd you are therefore both called to prepare your wedding garments through holy living – especially in how you love one another as husband as wife.\nShould you love each other as Christ loves his Bride, your marriage will be a powerful witness – through both laughter and tears – to a world which desperately needs the Bridegroom. It desperately needs the Bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong, and to make everything new.\nDo you know what that’s going to be like?\nIt’s going to be like a wedding banquet.\nIn Revelation 21(:2-4), John writes:\n“I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.\nAnd I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.\n‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”\nNow, we can anticipate that joy and celebration at the reception later today!\nBut we also get a glimpse of what’s coming when we partake of the Lord’s Supper.\nJust as God has not left the two of your alone, but has blessed you with each other’s companionship, Jesus has not left his Church on her own, but promises to be with her in the breaking of the bread and the sharing of the wine.\nTherefore, every time someone comes into contact with you as a Christ-centered couple, I pray they are reminded of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\nAnd every time the two of you, and all of you, partake of the Lord’s Supper, I pray you’ll remember that heavenly weddings, and the very best marriages, are all about the Bridegroom.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-grooms-big-day/","summary":"[soundcloud url=\u0026ldquo;https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/256270902\u0026quot; params=\u0026ldquo;color=ff5500\u0026amp;auto_play=false\u0026amp;hide_related=false\u0026amp;show_comments=true\u0026amp;show_user=true\u0026amp;show_reposts=false\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;100%\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;166\u0026rdquo; iframe=\u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; /]\nREADINGS Ephesians 5:21-33 – Wives and Husbands Psalm 67 – May God Be Gracious to Us and Bless Us Revelation 19:6-10 – The Marriage Supper of the Lamb Matthew 25:1-13 – The Parable of the Ten Virgins HOMILY What makes a great wedding?\nIs it the fragrance and color of the flower arrangements? The particular grandeur of the venue?\nIs it the number and camaraderie of the guests?","title":"The Groom's Big Day"},{"content":"What would it have been like, on the first Holy Saturday? What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?\nAll the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.\nAnd so, some sorry snots get up to try and encourage us. They open up the Hebrew Scriptures and read about our great God.\nRemember, when He made the heavens, earth, and humans? Remember, when He rescued Noah? Remember, when he stayed Abraham’s knife-laden hand? Remember, when he rescued us from Egypt? Remember, when he promised to bring us back from exile, restore our fortunes, and open our… graves? It’s too much, too soon. Shut up and sit down! Leave us mourn and weep awhile! Jesus is dead! The one we thought would save us is dead!\nIt’s been over a day. It’s been almost 2,000 years.\nCan these bones live? Can these bones live?\nThe question haunts us. The answer is so obviously “No! Of course not! They’re bones! No flesh, no breath, no life!”\nAnd yet, God asks Ezekiel. And He asks us. Can these bones live?\nAnd sure, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.\nCan these bones live? Can Christ’s bones live?\nSurely this question must have flickered in someone’s mind on the first Holy Saturday. And, yes, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.\nLook at the world! Dealing in death, day by day. Wars. Famines. Floods. Diseases. Droughts. Death.\nCan these bones live?\nLook at the Church! Claiming with her lips to follow Jesus Christ, and yet so often proving with her life that she wants no such thing. Scandal. Hypocrisy. Idolatry.\nCan these bones live?\nLook at yourselves! I’ll be honest, the question “can these bones live?” is put to every preacher facing a congregation! If the Spirit doesn’t move, I’m throwing hot air at dry bones!\nCan your bones live?\nBut then, look at me! Just as scandalous, hypocritical, and idolatrous as any – and yet here I stand, presuming to proclaim the Word of God to you.\nWho do I think I am? Can my bones live?\nCan all these dry, dead bones live?\nFriends, there’s a reason why we’re here, though it’s so dark, so late. Sure, it’s to bring in, bright and oh so early, the celebration of Easter.\nBut it’s also because keeping vigil is what the Church does every day. We keep vigil for the sake of a suffering and dying world. We keep watch for our bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong. We stay awake at the world’s late hour, surrounded by so many dry, dead bones.\nCan these bones live?\nYes. They can. But, what do they need in order to do so?\nFirst, they need some WATER. Did you notice how often water has appeared in tonight’s readings?\nThe waters of creation, out of which God called the dry ground – out of which He formed human beings. The waters of judgment, through which God saved Noah and his family in the Ark. The waters of redemption, through which God rescued Israel from the Egyptian house of slavery. And the waters of cleansing, by which the Lord promised in the prophets to wash away His people’s guilty stains. Water, water, everywhere! Except the dry valley.\nI think the dry bones need some sort of water.\nThey also need some sort of SPIRIT. You know, God’s Spirit, His breath, His wind, who hovered over the waters at creation.\nWho filled the first humans with life. Who led God’s people. Who inspired and preserved the words of Scripture we read this evening. Who rushed upon the dry bones in Ezekiel’s vision – making them into a great army, alive! Dry bones need the Spirit.\nBut, the question isn’t “Can these bones get wet and windy?” It’s “Can they LIVE?!”\nAnd, if they’re going to live, they’re going to need a RESURRECTION.\nThey need the defeat of their most ancient enemy: Death! They need Death’s reversal! They need Death’s death! They need exactly what God promised Ezekiel: to open their graves, and lift them up, living! Amen! Glory, glory, hallelujah!\nBut, if I hear Ezekiel’s glorious vision read at the first Holy Saturday, I’m tempted to lose it at this point. To bitterly ask those gathered:\n“ When?! That sounds great, but when?! When is God going to do this?!\nFor over five hundred years since Ezekiel, we’ve been falling into our graves over and over again – and staying there! Sure, it’s no longer in Babylon, but we’ve been invaded and harassed and dominated here in Judah ever since!\nIs it really that much better to fall into the grave under Rome’s heavy heel, like Jesus?\nWhy not Babylon’s?\nWhy not Assyria’s?\nHeck, why not Pharaoh’s?\nWhen is God going to turn things around?!”\nThankfully, I wasn’t in the audience back then. But we’re here, tonight. And maybe you’re similarly tempted to lose it and freak out sometimes in church!\nAll this pretty Jesus-talk, when for over 2,000 years the Church has travailed in the midst of a deadly and dying world.\nWe thank Jesus for our oversized meals, cars, and houses, while thousands fall into their graves around us – tired, hungry, destitute, and alone.\nSo, on the first Holy Saturday and the 2,000th, the question is roughly the same:\nWhen?! When is God going to turn things around?!\nAnd the answer is likewise the same. We sang it, earlier:\nWhen?\nTHIS IS THE NIGHT.\nWhen did God open the grave?\n“ THIS IS THE NIGHT, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave.”\nSo, can these bones live? Yes!\nCan Christ’s bones live? Yes! For on this night, some 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ got up from the tomb. He was alive. He was dead. But he is now alive again.\nCan our bones live? Yes!\nHow? Because Christ has provided the resurrection, the Spirit, and the water we need.\nBecause, through the waters of baptism, we receive the Spirit and the resurrection.\nNow, we aren’t going to baptize anyone tonight. We’ll have to wait until later this morning to do so. But we are about to renew our baptismal vows.\nThrough our baptism, we are preserved, like Noah, from the waters of Sin and Death, in the Ark, the Church. Through our baptism, we are ransomed and rescued, like Israel, through the waters of the Red Sea. Through our baptism, we are cleansed with the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, as God promised through Isaiah and Ezekiel. Through our baptism, we are buried with Christ in his death, and are raised with him in newness of life. Through our baptism, we are empowered and emboldened to proclaim the good news to a desperate world that JESUS CHRIST IS RISEN. So, we can assure the world that their bones can live, because Christ has died.\nWe can rest assured that our bones can live, because Christ is risen.\nAnd we can keep watch for the sake of a suffering world, because Jesus Christ will come again.\nAmen.\n(Sermon preached on Easter Vigil, March 26, 2016.

At the risk of breathtaking oversimplification, Anglicans have tended to adopt the former perspective, leading to accommodation, and Anabaptists the latter, resulting in separation. [1] Following Samuel Wells in his theological appropriation of terms from theatrical improvisation, the Anglican tradition has tended to respond to the promising offers (invitations to respond) of the state by accepting – maintaining the premise(s) of the state’s action(s). [2] The historical legacy of the Church of England has given Anglicanism, as Anderson notes, an “inheritance of a strong loyalty to the state and a conservatism that has led the church to promote the status quo more often than it agitates for reform.” [3] This inheritance from the established Church of England has coincided with a dual tendency to adopt a high status (a strategy for getting one’s way), in terms of relative privilege and political optimism, and a low status, in terms of frequent subservience in church-state relations. [4]\n(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: \u0026quot; Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?\u0026quot;)\nHowever, the Anabaptist tradition has tended to respond to the threatening offers of the state by blocking – undermining the premise(s) of the state’s action(s). [5] For many contemporary Anabaptists, as Joireman summarizes, “[T]he state has the function of ordering the social world, and the church should be the visible witness of believers, the primary affiliation of Christians, and separate from the state.” [6] Passively, blocking the state can be “a choice to shut oneself away and keep oneself unsullied by the world.” [7] Most often, drawing upon their sixteenth-century inheritance of facing persecution from Catholics and Protestants alike, Anabaptists have adopted a low status as somewhat of a fringe movement. Actively, however, blocking can be “a choice to take up arms,” as seen during the (admittedly rare) example of high status Anabaptist opposition during the Münster Rebellion of 1534. [8]\nQUESTIONING GIVENS The differences between accepting and blocking are apparent in the Anglican Articles of Religion of 1563 and the Anabaptist Schleitheim Confession of 1527. Although the former document, in article 37 (“Of the Civil Magistrates”), restricts administration of Word and Sacraments to the Church alone, it grants the monarch “the chief power in this Realm of England, and other his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil,” claiming that Scripture grants monarchs the authority to “rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.” Article 37 also accepts the death penalty and Christian military service. [9] In contradistinction, the Schleitheim Confession forbids Christian participation in civic affairs, swearing oaths, bearing the sword, and serving as a magistrate. [10]\nIn interpreting these texts, we must remember that, as Bell notes, “[I]t is anachronistic to speak of the church and the state as if these were two distinct social entities prior to the advent of modernity.” [11] And the subsequent historical realities of both movements have been much more complex and nuanced than the glaring differences between these two documents would suggest. Nevertheless, a political-theological impasse seems to exist between the two traditions, and I argue that both Anglican and Anabaptist movements – to the extent that they have engaged in the kinds of socio-political accepting and blocking sketched above – share a common weakness, which Wells’ improvisation framework highlights. Both are prone to accept the realities of the state as a given: a nonnegotiable fact of existence that must be either accepted (by Anglicans) or rejected (by Anabaptists). [12]\nFor example, in his explanation of the thirty-seventh Article of Religion, Bray demonstrates an Anglican acceptance of sinful socio-political realities as given:\nLike it or not, the world is in the grip of Satan and secular rulers who are Christians must come to terms with that fact. It is all very well to believe in peace, but pacifism is not a realistic option in a fallen creation. There have always been groups of Christians who have advocated it, but they have only been able to exist and maintain their principles because they are small and because the majority has been prepared to tolerate them. [13]\nFurthermore, though it disagrees on the corresponding duties of the church, the Schleitheim Confession agrees with the givenness of state violence:\nThe sword is ordained of God outside the perfection of Christ. It punishes and puts to death the wicked, and guards and protects the good. In the Law the sword was ordained for the punishment of the wicked and for their death, and the same [sword] is [now] ordained to be used by the worldly magistrates (Article 6).\nThe resulting disagreements between Anabaptists and Anglicans frequently take place on the level of either accepting or blocking the state, not questioning the state itself as a given.\nWells is right to invert the normal relationship between givens and gifts when it comes to Christian ethics:\nGod takes the place in Christian ethics normally reserved for time, death, sin, bodily limitation[, socio-political realities], and so on – the conventional boundaries. The only boundary, in other words, is the boundary of God. And meanwhile the place that God conventionally takes in Christian ethics – that of a perhaps helpful but largely peripheral and certainly not essential figure – in other words, a gift, a ‘bonus’ – should be taken by those familiar perennial so-called ‘givens.’ […] [T]he only given is God’s story, the theo-drama, the church’s narrative: all else is potentially gift. [14]\nWhile the state is indeed an actor within the theo-drama, the “five-act play of God” (creation, Israel, Jesus, church, eschaton), the church must remember that the state’s role pertains only from the fall and until the eschaton. [15] Arguably, Anglicans have overemphasized Act Two (Israel) in accepting the state, by tending to read the Old Testament (rather than Christ) as a model for political theology. [16] And Anabaptists have perhaps overemphasized Act Five (eschaton) in blocking the state, when, for instance, “Mennonites have sacrificed the study of politics, and this has led to a lack of sophistication in efforts to advocate for the worldwide church and an ineffectiveness in efforts to promote development and the well-being of Christians around the globe.” [17] Both traditions, at their worst, have defined politics as mere statecraft – the management of “a centralized power holding monopoly on violence within a defined territory,” a “civil society.” [18] Anglicans tend to join in the statecraft, and Anabaptists are more likely to withdraw.\nINCORPORATING GIFTS AND FORMING HABITS There is a way beyond the impasse between accepting and blocking the state: overaccepting it. As Wells defines it: “Overaccepting is accepting in light of a larger story,” in this case, the five-act story of God. To translate Wells’ language into the current topic, the Anglican risk of accepting is that the church “will be determined by the [state] and thus lose [its] integrity and identity.” The Anabaptist risk of blocking is that the church “will seal [it]self off from the world and thus lose [its] relevance in humanity.” However, “Overaccepting is an active way of receiving that enables one to retain both identity and relevance. It is a way of accepting without losing the initiative.” [19] It therefore offers the possibility of a synthesis between Anabaptist and Anglican approaches to the gift of the state.\nOveraccepting involves the realization that politics is not primarily about statecraft, but about true power and a just community. The church already has something to say about both. To the former, it confesses that “Jesus is Lord,” and that the most significant power-act in history has already occurred in Act Three of God’s five-act play. To the latter, it maintains that true community and communal justice are to be found in fellowship with the Triune God – a fellowship which takes place now in Act Four through Word and Sacrament, the church’s life of worship, in anticipation of Act Five. The church must therefore become more political, not less. As Cavanaugh rightly states: “The role of the church is not merely to make policy recommendations to the state, but to embody a different sort of politics, so that the world may be able to see a truthful politics and be transformed.” [20]\nAlthough a more political church sounds superficially similar to Anglican accepting, overaccepting the state involves countering the state’s apparent givenness – its myth of politics as community-through-dominion – by out-narrating it into the true givenness of God’s story, and remembering that the church, not the state, is catholic. [21] Therefore, this approach resembles the Anabaptist view of the church and the state, as Joireman puts it, “as separate and unequal, with an elevation of the church over the state.” [22] Nevertheless, the church’s overaccepting of the state is not the same as blocking through withdrawal. The church is public and political for the sake of the world, whose socio-political realities can be overaccepted as gifts, not givens. [23] As Bell clarifies, this need not lead to “a wholesale rejection of other political formations like modern states and civil society,” for it is possible that some forms of statecraft may serve the church “by maintaining an order that enables the church to carry out its properly public and political mission, which is the proclamation and ingathering of the true human communion/community.” Overaccepting the state can thereby overcome the weaknesses of both traditions and exploit their strengths.\nIn its liturgical worship, the church already has the resources to live a habitual life as a true polity for the sake of the world – even though liturgical manifestations differ between Anglicans and Anabaptists. The truly political worship that takes place in the church’s liturgy is, as Wannenwetsch clarifies, “meant neither to merely mirror existing political structures and procedures not to provide them with a religious rationale, but rather represents the unique politics of God.” [24] Through Word and Sacrament, the church reminds the world (and itself), that true politics is not found in wielding dominion, but in worshipping Dominum Iesum Christum.\nCONCLUSION: REINCORPORATING THE LOST One final way in which Anabaptists and Anglicans can unite in their approaches to the state is by entering the public sphere to advocate for the many victims of statecraft. During this, the Fourth Act of God’s story, the world’s false sense of politics has made a bloody habit of trampling upon exactly the kinds of people who will be exalted in Act Five to God’s heavenly banquet: widows, orphans, immigrants, and refugees. As Wells poignantly maintains: “The church has got to get used to the faces of the poor, because it will see them on the thrones in Act Five.” [25] The church’s test of the state’s offer is therefore liturgical: does the state resemble the liturgy by creating a polity in which the victims of statecraft can flourish? For that matter, does the church itself embody such a liturgy worth resembling? Very often, the answer is “no.”\nAnd yet, by the grace of God, this depressing given can be received as a gift, if these people are received as God’s gifts. Christians – Anabaptists, Anglicans, and others – can enter the public sphere and invite the oppressed to leave the ghettos, refugee camps, and killing fields into which they have been discarded by the world’s statecraft. We can eschew the twin errors of accommodation and separation, and instead invite these “others” to become “us” – to cross the borders, which states have erected to cling to their false and fear-driven dominions, and to enter into the true polity and politics of the Triune God.\n===NOTES=== [1] Rowland briefly describes the “complex oscillations between accommodation and separation” throughout church history, citing Anglicanism as an example of the former and Anabaptists of the latter. Note: if this oversimplification is too breathtaking, please substitute “Anglicans” with “accomodationists” and “Anabaptists” with “separationists” throughout. See Christopher Rowland, “Scripture: New Testament,” in The Blackwell Companion to Political Theology, eds. Peter Scott and William T. Cavanaugh (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2004), 21.\nDue to length requirements, my analysis of these two Christian traditions will be primarily theoretical and theological. For a better historical analysis of Anglican and Anabaptist views on the relationship between church and state than I can provide in this paper, see, among others: Leah Seppanen Anderson, “The Anglican Tradition: Building the State, Critiquing the State,” in Church, State, and Citizen: Christian Approaches to Political Engagement, ed.

Hinchliff provides a thorough examination of this historical legacy, before concluding that “historically, establishment has tended to make the Church, at least in some respects, the servant of the state. It might be thought, then, that the Anglican tradition would have been one which was conservative politically and disinclined to challenge the government. This has not, however, been the universal pattern.” He then cites a few examples which give nuance to the portrait of Anglicanism. However, the strong sense remains that the dominant Anglican approach has been politically conservative in terms of state loyalty.

Nevertheless, such was my assignment in seminary in 2015. Here are the results.\n“At the centre of Christian faith is the history of Christ. At the centre of the history of Christ is his passion and his death on the cross.” ~ Jürgen Moltmann [1]\nTheology in Outline: A[n Attempted] Summary of the Christian Faith We believe that, during the prefecture of Pontius Pilate, God died on a Roman cross. [2] We also believe that, the third day thereafter, Jesus of Nazareth – the same person who had been crucified – rose again from the dead.\nHow can these things be?\nHow can the immortal, transcendent, omnipotent One come to a weak, immanent end?\nHow can a dead human leave his grave, living?\nAt this point, we face a crucial choice between:\nthe posited “God” of metaphysical theism and the revealed God of the Christian faith. [3] Should we choose the former, our Christ, canon, and confession are irreducibly docetic – the true “God” is aloof, and merely play-acting, at best.\nYet, should we choose the latter, God is irreducibly, ineluctably Triune – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe, we trust that the Triune God is who God has revealed Godself to be.\nTHE HOLY TRINITY: The Main Character(s) of Theology The narrative of Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.” [4] These three dramatis personae Dei, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a persona in Israel\u0026rsquo;s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.” [5]\nYHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the Father by virtue of Jesus\u0026rsquo; address of him as such. [6] The Son is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address. [7] Finally, the Spirit appears as a persona of the story, first in the OT as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the NT as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church. [8] Yes, Jesus of Nazareth prayed to God, calling him Father. Yet this Son of God, confessed by Christians as “very God of very God” (Niceno-Constantinopolitan [Nicene] Creed), also cried out to the Father: “ My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Mark 15:34).\nAs Jenson rightly observes: “Therewith it becomes problematic that anything specified by listing ‘Father, Son, and Holy Spirit’ can be one God and not rather a mutually betraying pantheon.” [9]\nA simple solution to this problem of God’s unity would be to maintain that either just one (Subordinationism) or none (Modalism) of the three identities mentioned is really God. However, because the Church trusts Scripture as divine revelation, it believes that it knows the real God, whom it worships – delusion, according to Modalism. Furthermore, the Church worships all three divine Persons – idolatry, according to Subordinationism.\nWe believe that we can truly know God in revelation, that God can give Godself to be known as an object, because God is first known by Godself – as Subject (Father), Object (Son), and Act of Revelation (Holy Spirit). [10]\nIn order to do justice to worship and the Word of God (or better, worship of the Word of God: Jesus), the Church confesses “that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit” ( Athanasian Creed). One in three, three in one: Father, Son, and Spirit – each Person equally and essentially God, and yet each distinct from the other two.\nWhat about the “mutually betraying pantheon” revealed in Christ’s cry of dereliction?\nAs it turns out, the Spirit preserves God’s unity at the most frayed moment – maintaining the bond of love between the forsak ing Father and the forsak en Son, a love so powerful it conquered death. [11] Through the power of the Holy Spirit, Christ is raised from the grave, revealed to be who he has always been: the Son of God (Rom. 1:4), and thereby restored to the Father.\nThe Trinity is one God, not three, because it is concerned with “a relationship between persons in which these persons constitute themselves in their relationship with each other.” [12] The doctrine of the Trinity holds together Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – as well as Crucifixion and Resurrection.\nAnd yet, we are still faced with the difficulty of the Incarnation: how can the eternal God be so temporal, the transcendent One so immanent?\n(For more on the Trinity, see my essay: \u0026ldquo;The Holy Trinity: What Is It? (Why) Is It Important?\u0026rdquo;)\nELECTION \u0026amp; CREATION There is no escape from time, not even for God. The Trinity holds together not just Crucifixion and Resurrection, but time itself. [13]\n“ Eternal” most properly means “without beginning, without end,” and not “ timeless,” which means “without past, present, or future.”\nIf we remove “timeless” from our definition of God’s eternality, the Trinity’s identification of itself with its temporal opera ad extra poses less of a theological threat (to divine transcendence), beginning with its first external work: election.\nOr is it creation?\nBarth is right to expose the dialectical relationship between the two:\n“The creation of God, and therefore His positing of a reality distinct from Himself, is the external basis and possibility of the covenant. And the covenant itself is the internal basis and possibility of creation, and therefore of the existence of a reality distinct from God” (CD III/2, 204).\nThe creaturely form and covenant content of the Triune God’s external works find their basis in the election of Jesus as the nexus of God and humanity – Christ is the electing God and the elected human, before the act of creation.\nThat Jesus exists as the elect(ing) God-human before humanity itself exists – that he can precede himself, as it were – is but an illustration of the Triune God’s temporal transcendence, which is not threatened by (but rather displayed through) immanence.\nBy, for, and to Jesus Christ “the universe is created as a theatre for God’s dealings with man and man’s dealings with God” (CD II/2, 94). Without a fully-orbed view of the Trinity, this extension outward from Godself to that which is not God, from Creator to creature, seems arbitrary. And yet, while God’s freedom can never be reduced to mere necessity, the eternal love which characterizes the life of the Trinity makes God’s free decision to elect and create most fitting.\nThrough Christ, there is a correspondence between the existence and love of God ad intra – between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – and the existence and love of God ad extra to humanity.\nHumanity only exists within this Christological correspondence, on the basis of a shared sphere with Christ. [14] Therefore, “to be a man is to be with God,” for no matter what else each individual is, “he is on the basis of the fact that he is with Jesus and therefore with God” (CD III/2, 135). The Incarnation grounds anthropology in the Triune God’s address to humanity through Jesus Christ.\nRECONCILIATION However, the Incarnation also yields the clearest view of sin’s absurdity.\nAlthough the distinction between Creator and creation entails the possibility of creaturely conflict with God, it does not necessitate actual sin.\nGiven the Christological and theological basis of human existence, it makes no sense for a human to actualize this possibility, for “if he denies God, he denies himself” and “chooses his own impossibility” (CD III/2, 136).\nJust as there is no God behind God, there is no humanity beyond the divine summons, beyond existence in the same sphere inhabited by Christ. It is therefore unthinkable that humanity should try to be the source of its own existence, and yet this is precisely that which occurs.\nTherefore, sin is not merely moral – it is both ontological and incomprehensible: the inherent contradiction of a nothingness which opposes God as the very ground of all existence and reality.\nBack to the Cross and the Empty Tomb Pardon the cyclical nature of this discussion, but it is time to return to the Crucifixion and Resurrection.\nWhy did God the Father forsake? Why was God the Son forsaken? Why did the Spirit need to overcome the divine distancing?\nThe answer to these questions begins with the eternal (before creation, but not timeless) election of Jesus Christ – for he is not just the electing God and elected human, but also the damned human and the damned God.\nElection is therefore double, in that (1) God elects unto Godself, through Jesus Christ, the incomprehensible nothingness – the terrible “No” – that is the inevitable outworking of human sin. However, (2) God elects unto humanity, through Jesus Christ, the unmerited invitation – the wonderful “Yes” – into the love and life of the Triune God.\nAn eternal exchange. A “Yes” and a “No.”\nThis is all beginning to sound rather timeless.\nAnd yet, a proper appreciation of the timeliness of the Trinity is necessary to make sense of the divine revelation we have actually received, for the Bible contains but an account of the Trinity’s external works in the midst of time – first through the story of Israel, and then through the story of the Church. [15]\nTHE STORY OF SCRIPTURE: Between creation and the Incarnation lies the story of ISRAEL, lamentably overlooked in many formulations of the Christian faith. [16]\nDespite the invasion of SIN(Gen. 3) – which ruptured the perfect relationships between God and humanity, humanity and itself, and humanity and the rest of creation (with ontological implications, as mentioned above) – God does not abandon creation to its exile. Neither does God instantaneously fix things. Instead, God takes time.\nGod calls Abraham and the nation of Israel back to unity with himself through COVENANT. He endeavors to pull them – and through them as a priestly nation, the world – back from the ruptured relationships into covenantal fellowship and oneness. [17]\nHowever, the faithless Israelites repeatedly eschew the loving faithfulness of their God, leading to the EXILE of the nation. [18]\nIn fulfillment of God’s eternal election, at the INCARNATION, the Trinity stretches through the Son to meet all humanity – as a Jewish man in the midst of Israel – in its state of partial exile, to fulfill the global mission of Israel. [19]\nAs God enters our midst as Jesus Christ, he pushes us to the side in our perverted attempts to secure our own existence. [20] Without succumbing to sin’s siren call, he is fully affected by it, bringing sinful human nature into the life of God and thereby intensifying the divine reaction against it into an ultimate tension. [21] The one ultimately worthy to exile is now also the one ultimately worthy of exile.\nOnce more, to the CROSS. There, the Trinity stretches to the utmost, as the Son of God, worthy to mete out the sentence of exile, instead goes into exile – into the far country of the grave – bearing the consequences of sin for the sake of humanity’s salvation. [22] At the death of Christ, the Trinity has stretched to its limit, and yet humanity is left in a state of partial exile as before.\nHowever, through the power of the Holy Spirit, the exiled Son of God is vindicated as the Savior of the world and brought back from the far country of death!\n(For more on the Resurrection, see my sermon: \u0026ldquo;Son Of Man, Can Your Bones Live?\u0026rdquo;)\nThrough this movement of the Son into the utmost exile and back again, sin itself is offered up to destruction. [23]\nAnd crucially, all humanity who is united to him by grace through faith – everyone who is therefore in Christ – gets caught up with the Son in his return to the life and love of the Triune God. [24]\nTHE CHURCH And yet, getting caught up with Christ in this return to Triune fellowship does not take place timelessly or instantaneously.\nIt is, rather, an already, not-yet phenomenon. Between the Resurrection and the present moment lies the ongoing (for about two millennia, now) story of the Church.\nAnd while all Christians confess some sort of belief in the future return of Jesus to set things right, to “judge the living and the dead” ( Apostles’ Creed), it is a particular (though not unique) strength of Anglicanism that it endeavors to take seriously both the timeliness and diversity of the Trinity’s external work throughout the Church’s history.\nSpecifically, since the Holy Spirit has been faithful to sustain the Church and supply it with leaders and teachers throughout its existence as a community “in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments,” timely works of the Trinity, if you will, “be duly ministered” ( Articles of Religion, 19), Anglicans feel free to draw upon the diverse breadth of thought throughout the history of Christ’s Body.\n[For example, I do not expect to be reprimanded for drawing heavily upon Barth, Moltmann, and Jenson (non-Anglicans, all) throughout this paper! [25]]\nOn one hand, Anglicans believe that\n“ [i]t is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been divers[e], and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men\u0026rsquo;s manners, so that nothing be ordained against God\u0026rsquo;s Word” (Articles of Religion, 34).\nChurch history is not homogeneous, nor is it infallible.\nAnd yet, on the other hand, Anglicans are convinced that it is not necessary to jettison the great tradition(s) of the Church in order to achieve reform. Usually, one should only dispense with Church traditions that appear directly to contradict God’s Word:\n“Whosoever, through his private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church…” (Articles of Religion, 34).\nThe history of the “one, holy, catholic, and apostolic” ( Nicene Creed) Church, despite its frequent descent into divided, profane, sectarian innovation, has great value.\nBecause it is a part of the history of the temporally-eternal, transcendently-immanent, Triune God – because it matters to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – the life and history of the Church ought to matter to all who call themselves Christians, Anglicans or not.\n( View PDF here.)\nNOTES [1] Jürgen Moltmann, The Way of Jesus Christ: Christology in Messianic Dimensions(Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 1990), 151.\n[2] Regarding the precise date of the Crucifixion, scholars are divided between AD 30 and 33.\n[3] On the Crucifixion as theophany, see Moltmann, The Crucified God (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 1993 [1973]).\n[4] Robert W. Jenson, \u0026ldquo;The Trinity in the Bible\u0026rdquo; Concordia Theological Quarterly 68, no. 3-4 (2004): 199. The divinity of the Father is perhaps the easiest to note throughout the Bible. On the divinity of the Son, see John 1, 10; Col. 2; Phil. 2; and Heb. 1. On the divinity of the Spirit, see 1 Cor. 2:11; Heb. 3:7-10; and 10:15-17.\n[5] Jenson, \u0026ldquo;The Trinity in the Bible,\u0026rdquo; 198-202.\n[6] Cf.

This is an apt definition of perichoresis.\n[13] “And for this reason, too, we have no need to project anything into eternity, for at this point eternity is time, i.e., the eternal name has become a temporal name, and the divine name a human. […] [I]n so far as these works are done in time, they rest upon the eternal decision of God by which time is founded and governed” (CD II/2, 98-9). See also Jenson, Story and Promise (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress, 1973), ch. 7.\n[14] “The ontological determination of humanity is grounded in the fact that one man among all others is the man Jesus” (CD III/2, 132).\n[15] Scripture itself seems to glimpse at the tension (but not the rift) between time and eternity in the midst of redemption. Christ, the “Lamb of God that was slaughtered from the foundation of the world” (Rev. 13:8), “was chosen before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for [humanity’s] sake” (1 Pet. 1:20), in order to overcome Sin and Death – God’s cosmic enemies which infected and affected every level of creation at the Fall (Gen. 3).\n[16] Although, thankfully, the Old Testament is addressed in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion! Consider the beginning of Article VII (Of the Old Testament): “The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transitory promises.”\n[17] See foundational covenant passages, such as Gen. 12, 15, throughout the Old Testament.\n[18] Consider, for example, the curses for covenantal unfaithfulness found in Deut. 27:14-26; 28:15-68, culminating with the threat of exile.\n[19] As Irenaeus and Athanasius proclaimed: “God became what we are so that we might become what He is.”\n[20] In Barth’s words, “because our evil case otherwise meant our inevitable destruction, God willed to make it His own in Jesus Christ. What we are He Himself willed to become, in order to take and transform it from within, to make of it something new, the being of man reconciled with Himself” (CD IV/1, 242).\n[21] According to Barth, “in the place of all men [Christ] has himself wrestled with that which separates them from him. He has himself borne the consequence of this separation to bear it away “(CD IV/1, 237-8).\n[22] CD IV/1, 247.\n[23] “In the suffering and death of Jesus Christ it has come to pass that in his own person he has made an end of us as sinners and therefore of sin itself by going to death as the One who took our place as sinners. In his person he has delivered up us sinners and sin itself to destruction” (CD IV/1, 253).\n[24] Cf. 1 Cor 15:20-22. As the nexus of redemption and re-creation, the resurrection is crucial – for the focus of the atonement is not merely to sentence sin with its proper exile, but to fulfill God’s creative purposes for unity and participation in the divine life.\n[25] Although, I may be reprimanded for giving the Sacraments such short shrift.

Introduction: The Prodigal Son, Part 2 What a relief, to get out of that house.\nOrdinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey!\nBut ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.\nSo he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.\nBut now he was almost home, and the painful thoughts came rushing back.\n“Dad has changed. Perhaps it was early-onset dementia that caused him to forget the blessed closeness of our years together, alone, when I was not just the firstborn, but the only son. Sure, I had never been perfect, but I thought that my father was finally proud of me. That, after years of hard lessons learned, I had become the man he wanted me to be.\nAnd then Ethan threw it all away.\nActually, you know what, as it that weren’t bad enough, dad threw it all away…for Ethan.\nHe received much more love than I ever did.\nI used to get punished for much slighter infractions than throwing my entire life (along with our hard-earned savings) away!\nI never got a banquet when I broke Sabbath…I got a beating!”\nAt this point, Jude’s unpleasant thoughts were interrupted by the sight of the homestead on the horizon.\nThe first thing he noticed was the amount of trash bags on the front porch.\nNot much later, the smell hit him. Odors he’d only ever experienced in faraway marketplaces, and therefore that much more memorable.\nBarely believing his eyes and his nose, Jude took a closer look at the trash.\nGrilled pork chop remnants. Crusty booze bottles. Bacon pizza fragments. Ashen cigarette butts. The slimy shells of shellfish. His blood pressure rising, Jude spit on the refuse-pile and stormed in the front door.\n“Dad! Where are you!? He’s done it again! Brought his dirty Gentile friends into our home! Dad?!”\nA very obviously hungover Ethan stumbled into the main room, nibbling on a piece of bacon. “Jude! You’re back…”\nAnd Jude broke:\n“Damn you, Ethan! You ethnoi, you Gentiles!\nHow can you continually scorn our father’s, the Father’s, righteousness!?\nFirst, you go and throw away your life and our life-savings to run away with swine?!\nThen, after the Father somehow took you in – adopted you like some bastard, orphaned children – you bring the swine back into this house?!\nYou think you’re so strong, so powerful, but you’re weak!\nYou think you know who the Father is, what he’s like, but you’re wrong!\nWe’re strong! We’re the firstborn sons of God!\nWho in the hell do you Gentiles think you are?! If you really loved God, you would follow the Law and keep the traditions… How can the Father love you? It’s embarrassing, really. We never should have allowed you back into this house.\nBy now, Ethan was boiling over as well:\n“Damn you, Jude! You Judaioi, you Jews!\nHow can you continually forget our father, the Father’s grace?!\nDon’t you realize by now that all your stupid rituals, all your hard lessons learned, were a complete waste of time!?\nWe Gentiles and God have moved on into the age of grace!\nYou Jews have FORGOTTEN the point of God’s grace, and so He’s practically forgotten you!\nWe’re the firstborn, best-loved sons now.\nWe’re the strong ones, and we outnumber you all at least three to one, so shut up and deal with it!\nYou’ve SCREWED UP so often, you got KICKED OUT of your land!\nAnd you didn’t learn any lessons then, because you got yourselves THROWN OUT of Rome!\nHow could Nero have let you back into this city? It’s shameful, really. We never should have allowed you back into this Church, you…”\n[KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK]\nSomeone at the door.\nThe Roman Christians – Jew and Gentile alike – froze in fear.\nEthan looked at the other Gentile leaders.\nWas it a centurion? Had their gathering been reported? Would they be asked to bow the knee, to offer a sacrifice, to the new emperor, Nero? If they weren’t willing to do so, would this be the end?\nJude glanced at his wife, their children, and the other Jewish families.\nHad they already outstayed their recent welcome back to the city? After exile, they’d spent four hard, hard years rebuilding their life in Rome. Would they again be driven from their homes? Where would they go?\nThe slaves in the room – and there were many – anxiously retraced their steps throughout the day.\nWhich one of their fellow slaves had discovered their secret? Had followed them to this meeting? Had told their master? Would they merely get whipped again? Or had their master’s patience run out?\nJude whispered to Ethan, “You’re in charge here, get the door.”\nHe trudged to the threshold and pulled it open.\nA hooded figure stepped through, walked to the middle of the room, and pulled the hood back.\nLong brown hair flowed down.\nThe woman said “Christ is Risen!” “…He is…risen…indeed,” they all stammered in reply.\nShe smiled:\n“He is risen indeed. For twenty-five years now, in fact! Greetings. My name is Phoebe of Cenchreae.”\nRummaging in her pack, she began to explain:\n“I bring something for all of you from Paul, the apostle… It’s in here, somewhere. Not this theology textbook. Not this to-do list… Ah! Here it is, a letter.”\nAfter carefully opening the document, she began to read the following words.\nNow, her first audience didn’t have the benefit of reading these words off a page, but that’s no excuse for you not to follow along in your Bible, if you’ve got it with you.\nOpen up to Romans 1, and as I read these words, imagine Phoebe reading them for the first time to a room full of Roman Christians.\nReading these words like she was convinced they were absolutely true.\nShe began:\nPaul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles, among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ, To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God\u0026rsquo;s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you. For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you — that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other\u0026rsquo;s faith, both yours and mine. I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”\nNow, although that concludes the chunk of Romans we’ll consider today, Phoebe went on to read the rest of the 7,114 Greek words in the letter.\nAnd, as far as we know, as the one to deliver this letter, she would have also been its first interpreter. That is, she would have answered the questions of the first audience regarding what had been read.\nNow, despite Paul’s wide influence in the early Church, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that at least one woefully-uninformed Christian at Rome would have raised his hand and asked: “Who is Paul?” I mean, Who was Paul, really?\nII. From Paul Well, as sister Phoebe mentioned, about twenty-five years separated the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and Paul’s penning of the letter to the Christians at Rome in 57, 58 AD.\nIf you wanted to find Paul in the same year that Jesus of Nazareth walked out of his grave, you might be a bit frustrated as you repeatedly flip through the “P” section of your Palestinian Phonebook. Because, see, Saul, of Tarsus, is your guy.\nAnd, like some others whose names have changed, Paul had a past.\nHe’d done some things.\nAnd I’m not going to spoil this with some alliterated list. I’ll let Paul tell you about his past:\nIn Acts 22:3-4, he says, if you’ll indulge the paraphrase:\n“I’m a Jew. Sure, I was born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up right here in Jerusalem, educated in Dr. Gamaliel’s strict, strict seminary to learn and live the Law of Moses. I was just as zealous for God as any Jew. How zealous? I persecuted this Way, these Christians, to the death! I’d throw any of them I could, men or women, into prison!”\nIn Acts 26:5b, 9-11, he says:\n“I wasn’t just any zealous Jew, either. I was a Pharisee! […] I hated and opposed the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Jerusalem was my first Christian-hunting ground! I asked my superiors for permission, then threw those Christians in jail! And when it was time for their death-row judgment, I always cast a kill-vote. Just for fun, sometimes, I’d try to trip them up in synagogue – ask them just the right theological questions to get them to show their heretical cards. But deep down, I hated them. When they fled Jerusalem, I pursued them.\u0026quot;\nIn Galatians 1:13-14, he says:\n\u0026ldquo;You know what I did in my Jewish-only days, how I tried to wipe the church of God from the face of the earth. I was climbing the rungs of Judaism faster than anyone else my age. I was more zealous for the traditions than any of my old seminary buddies.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Philippians 3:5-6, he says:\n\u0026ldquo;I was circumcised, I was as Hebrew as Hebrew could be; as to the law, a righteous Pharisee – no one followed it better!; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church;\u0026rdquo;\nIn 1 Timothy 1:13, he says:\nI once was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent.\nA Jew. A Pharisee. A blasphemer. A persecutor. An insolent opponent. Such was Saul of Tarsus.\nAnd YET, here, Paul, to the Christians at Rome, declares himself, first:\nA SLAVE. NOT, as previously, to his own zeal for the traditions and the so-called “righteousness” of the Law of Moses.\nBut a SLAVE of CHRIST JESUS. Taking orders from the one whose name he had previously and viciously endeavored to oppose!\nPaul declares himself, second:\nCALLED NOT, as he had previously supposed, to persecute the Church.\nBut to plant churches! To serve the church as an APOSTLE, as an ambassador, as an envoy – with a message from his master, Christ Jesus.\nA slave. Called an apostle. Paul declares himself, third:\nSET APART NOT, as previously, for the sake of the Law as a Pharisee, which literally meant “one set apart.”\nBut set apart for the sake of the GOSPEL! The good news regarding his master!\nPaul wants to serve the Church at Rome by preaching the gospel there, in order to strengthen them spiritually. This letter to the Romans will preach the gospel in his stead until he can do so face to face. No longer a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But now a slave, an apostle, set apart for the gospel…Such was Paul!\n**Quite the transition! Don’t you think?**\nIt almost make us wonder:\n“ What could be powerful enough to transform someone like this?”\n“ What could be powerful enough to transform someone like this?”\nBut…c’mon, we’re not studying Paul himself. We’re taking a look at Romans, remember? And, while no one would have asked sister Phoebe this question back then, we need to ask it today:\n**Who were the Romans? Who were these Christians at Rome?**\nIII. To the Roman Christians Well, like everyone, name-change or not, they had a past.\nAt one time – the Jews and the Gentiles alike – were both faithless. They were more or less groping along in the darkness until they came to know Jesus the Messiah.\nNow, we don’t know much about how Christianity first spread westward from Jerusalem to the center of the Roman Empire. However, it was probably taken there by Jewish Christians - perhaps by the Jewish “visitors from Rome” who, according to Acts 2:10, were present at Pentecost.\nRegardless, those Christians present in Rome when Phoebe arrived were, in general, no longer completely faithless. After all, Jesus the Messiah had enough of a claim on their lives for them to risk attending a potentially unpopular meeting.\nAnd yet, much like Saul had been ashamed of the Jews who had chosen to follow a crucified Messiah (…not to mention how much that Pharisee would have been ashamed of Gentile sinners!)…\nNow, not just annoyed, or irritated. But ashamed. Embarrassed. Disgusted by the very existence of something, because it is humiliating.\nCome on and feel this for a second. We know what it’s like, to look in the mirror, to look back into our past, and feel gut-wrenching shame – at our high-handed sins, our careless words, our lies and our lusts. Because we’ve DONE some things. We have a PAST. **Shameful, really.**\nWell…Much like the previous Paul, the Christians at Rome were ashamed.\nFirst, they were at least tempted to be ashamed of a Savior who didn’t exactly live up to the Roman ideals of power and prestige. This was real, this was raw. It may have been a bit embarrassing sometimes, to walk by the huge buildings and striking soldiers of the Empire to go and worship in secret a guy who had been\nmocked, beaten, stripped naked, and nailed to a tree until he died like a common criminal. Ashamed, of Jesus Christ.\nSecond, they were ashamed of each other.\nI hope my, admittedly apocryphal introduction gave you at least a taste of what it could have been like to be a Christian at Rome. Based on historical evidence and what Paul has to say at the end of this letter, we can surmise that the Roman church shifted from predominantly Jewish to predominantly Gentile.\nPositively, this could have happened through new Gentile converts. Negatively, Emperor Claudius expelled the Jews from the city of Rome in AD 49 due to a Jewish dispute about Christ. Acts 18:2 mentions Priscilla and Aquila as two of the Jews thus exiled. With most of the Jews forced to leave the city, the churches would have become predominantly Gentile.\nHowever, after Claudius’ death in AD 54, the Jews began to return to Rome under the new emperor, Nero. …To return to churches now led by and populated with Gentiles – Gentiles who no longer followed certain restrictions in the Mosaic Law.\nJewish Christians were ashamed of their libertine Gentile brothers and sisters in Christ. How could these people so quickly forget the Jewish origins of their faith?\nGentile Christians were ashamed of their Jewish brothers and sisters in Christ, because they were personae non gratae – unwelcome persons – to many Romans. They only increased the risk that the next knock on the door would be an unhappy centurion.\nAshamed and divided. Such were the Christians at Rome.\nAnd yet Paul writes to them, to call them – as Christ had called them – to something better. What was it?\nThe “obedience of faith” – and here Paul’s transformation links up with theirs.\nLook at what he says in verse 5:\nthrough Christ “we have received grace and apostleship (Paul’s transformation) to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the Gentiles(the Roman Christians’ transformation)”\nNow, what does this obedience of faith, this obedient faithfulness, if you will, look like?\nWell, to be honest with you, Paul doesn’t have much to say about this in these introductory paragraphs. He’s starting his audience off on a long trajectory, but he does return to the obedience of faith at the end of this letter! The exact phrase appears in the letter’s last sentence, in fact.\nBut the idea of obedient faithfulness appears a bit earlier.\nIn chapters 1-3, we see what the opposite of obedient faithfulness looks like. At the end of chapter 3, we see what God’s saving faithfulness looks like (…It looks like Jesus!)\nIn chapter 4, we see that obedient faithfulness still looked pretty similar in the Old Testament – with father Abraham, of whom it’s said in verses 20-21:\n“No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in faith as he gave glory to God, (even before he was circumcised, mind you), fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised”\nIn chapters 5-8, we see various facets of God’s saving faithfulness as the foundation of our obedient faithfulness.\nIn chapters 9-11, we are reminded that there is HOPE for obedient faithfulness among the Jewish people, because God remains utterly faithful to his promises.\nAnd, I suggest to you that Paul refers to this obedient faithfulness in the well-known beginning of chapter 12:\n“I appeal to you therefore, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship,”\nor your “ rational service,” or your “ obedient faithfulness.”\n“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”\nIn the rest of chapter 12, we find out that obedient faithfulness looks like humility (12:3-8) and love (12:9-21).\nIn chapter 13, we find out what humility and love look like when translated from another person to an impersonal government.\nAnd then in chapters 14 and 15 we get to the pastoral heart of Paul’s letter. The Christians at Rome were letting holy days and food laws come between them.\nI find two verses of rebuke especially poignant:\nRomans 14:15 – “For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.” Romans 14:20 – “Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God.” Here’s what I’m getting at: Paul calls the ashamed and divided Christians at Rome to the obedient faithfulness of UNITY.\nConsider 15:5-7:\n“May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.”\nThink about it: this is a far cry from Jude and Ethan’s passionate argument at the beginning! Again, we must ask:\nWhat could be powerful enough to transform people like this? What could be powerful enough to transform people like this?\nThe same thing that was powerful enough to change Saul to Paul: the gospel. What is the gospel?\nIV. Through the Gospel Well, much like God’s people, including Paul and the Roman Christians, God’s gospel has a past.\nSee, it was once a partial promise to the people of Israel. Writing to his divided and divisive audience of Jew and Gentile Christians, Paul begins with the gospel’s Jewish roots:\nLook at verses 2-3:\nGod had promised the gospel “beforehand through his prophets in the holy [Hebrew] Scriptures, concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh.”\nA Jewish mission. A Jewish hope. A Son of David, in human flesh. But how is this powerful enough to transform?\nHow does this Jewish mission have a claim on the faithful obedience of the Gentiles?\n**Because the Son of David is the Son of God.\\\\\nThe one born, and crucified, in the weakness of human flesh, is RAISED by the Holy Spirit in the power of resurrection! And this powerfully risen Messiah is the LORD. The Lord over more than Emperor Nero’s puny Roman playground. He is the Lord of heaven and earth! Of Jews and Gentiles.\nYou know, merelycrucified Messiah is a poor Messiah indeed – worthy of shame. But a RISEN Messiah is a TRUE Messiah – worthy of obedience and faithfulness.\nPaul is therefore not ashamed of the gospel, because he recognizes its resurrection power – a power to save and transform ALL those who believe – both Jews and Gentiles who trust that Jesus Christ is who he says he is – the Son of God!,\nWho trust that he has done what he set out to do – to save and to redeem through his life, death, resurrection and ascension.\nThe gospel is therefore powerful enough to save and transform all those who trust that God is who he says he is– which is to say all those who believe that God himself is righteous.\nHe is faithful to keep his promises – his covenants\nto Adam, to Noah, to Abraham, to Moses, to David, to Jeremiah, and to all of creation – his promises\nto put the world back together again, to not let Sin and Death have the final word, but to raise his people from their graves, to melt their hearts of stone, to breathe breath, his Spirit, into their dry bones and lifeless flesh, to bring the dead back to life, to bring US back to life, read Romans 8! to make the faithless ones faithful, to make US faithful. **God’s saving faithfulness to all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – through Jesus the Messiah calls forth, by the Holy Spirit, obedient faithfulness from all humanity – both Jews and Gentiles – to Jesus the Messiah.**\nHis saving faithfulness demands obedient faithfulness, and his Holy Spirit enables it.\nGod’s saving faithfulness demands and the Holy Spirit enables obedient faithfulness:\nSo that, as Paul says in 5:21,\n“just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”\nSo that, as in 8:38,\n“neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor heavenly rulers, nor things that are present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\nSo that, as in 15:5-6,\n“the God of endurance and comfort [may] give you unity with one another in accordance with Christ Jesus, so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.”\nV. Conclusion: Obedient Faithfulness Today? Now, I’m speaking to a room full of seminarians.\nWe know that the gospel is powerful enough to conquer Sin and Death.\nWe believe that the blood of Jesus is a powerful enough detergent to wash away our guilty stains.\nWe feel an adrenaline rush when we read Romans 8:38,\nbecause we trust that NOTHING will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord! We know that’s why Romans is so stinking long, why Paul couldn’t just start with chapter 14…\nBecause we know that the only thing powerful enough\nto unite divided and ashamed Jews and Gentiles is the gospel! We have faith that the gospel is powerful enough\nto transform Saul into Paul, to unite Jews and Gentiles, to transcend their divisions! ***BUT: Do we have faith that the gospel is powerful enough to transcend OUR divisions?** …Is the gospel powerful enough to transcend our differences? …Is the gospel powerful enough:\nTo unite liturgy-loving Anglicans with Bible-thumping Baptists?\nTo bring together, in LOVE:\nThe contemporary and the traditional, The “smells and bells” with the seeker-sensitive, The 1928 Prayer Books with the 1979 Prayer Books, with the “What’s a Prayer Book?”s The Lutherans and the Reformed The Democrats and the Republicans The Calvinists and the Arminians The Blacks and the Whites The Piperites and the N.T. Wrightians The Latinos and the Asians The egalitarians and complementarians The rich and the poor The paedobaptists and the credobaptists? …the list goes on.\n“Do not destroy someone for whom Christ died. Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of _______, be it your prayer-book preferences or your theological idiosyncrasies.”\nSee, Paul could have attempted to unify the Roman Christians by turning their faith in on itself. By encouraging them to admire, as if in a mirror, the surprising fact that their diverse church existed in the center of a pagan empire! But he did NOT do that!\nInstead, he maintained that the gospel reveals God’s righteousness “from faith to faith” –\nFROM the Faithful God TO his previously faithless, but potentially faithful and unified, people! FROM GOD TO US\nThat order is important! Because it will not do to engage in ecclesiastical navel-gazing! We can’t just look at ourselves and marvel at the fact that our diverse seminary exists in the center of a pagan empire! No! We must look to Christ! For he himself is our peace, first with God and then with oneanother!\nIf we look at one another, before looking at Christ, and try to transcend our differences on our own, then we will inevitably become ashamed of one another.\nAshamed. I can’t believe that God let some of y’all into his Church!\nI’m embarrassed and frustrated by some of you. Sure, on my better days, I’ll admit you’re my brothers and sisters. But most days, we don’t feel much like siblings. Or maybe, we feel a bit TOO MUCH like human siblings, bickering and nagging and fighting.\nAnd sure, I know I embarrass and frustrate some of you. And if that doesn’t apply to you yet, just wait! I’ll get there.\nFriends, Sisters, Brothers, If we are on our own in this crazy thing called Church, it’s a hopeless, frustrating mess.\nBut if we trust that Paul knew what he was doing when he began with the GOSPEL in this lengthy pastoral letter to a divided church,\nIf we look to Christ Jesus and trust that the gospel is powerful enough, not just to save, transform, and unify them, back then… but US, RIGHT NOW… If we look to Christ and trust: Then, TOGETHER we “may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Then, TOGETHER we may “receive one another, just as Christ also received [us], to God’s glory.”\nThen, TOGETHER we may sing and believe the words of the following hymn:\nYou’ve got a handout with the words. Would you stand and sing it with me?\nThe Church’s one foundation Is Jesus Christ her Lord, She is His new creation By water and the Word. From heaven He came and sought her To be His holy bride; With His own blood He bought her And for her life He died.\nShe is from every nation, Yet one o’er all the earth; Her charter of salvation, One Lord, one faith, one birth; One holy Name she blesses, Partakes one holy food, And to one hope she presses, With every grace endued.\nThough with a scornful wonder Men see her sore oppressed, By schisms rent asunder, By heresies distressed: Yet saints their watch are keeping, Their cry goes up, “How long?” And soon the night of weeping Shall be the morn of song!\n’Mid toil and tribulation, And tumult of her war, She waits the consummation Of peace forevermore; Till, with the vision glorious, Her longing eyes are blest, And the great Church victorious Shall be the Church at rest.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/faithful-faith-in-a-faithful-god-romans-1-1-17/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=invos5n6zts[/embed]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"i-introduction-the-prodigal-son-part-2\"\u003eI.

Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.And he cautioned them, saying, “Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They said to him, “Twelve.”“And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” And they said to him, “Seven.”And he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”\nIn an interview, published in 1974, with famed thinker Bertrand Russell, Leo Rosten asked Russell the following:\n\u0026ldquo;Let us suppose, sir, that after you have left this sorry vale, you actually found yourself in heaven, standing before the Throne. There, in all his glory, sat the Lord—not Lord Russell, sir: God.\u0026rdquo;\nRussell winced.\n\u0026ldquo;What would you think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I would think I was dreaming.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But suppose you realized you were not? Suppose that there, before your very eyes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, was God. What would you say?\u0026rdquo;\nThe pixie wrinkled his nose. \u0026ldquo;I probably would ask, \u0026lsquo;Sir, why did you not give me better evidence?\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nIn Numbers 14:11, YHWH says to Moses:\n“How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?”\nAs we return to consider our passage from Mark 8, keep in mind that in the region of Tyre, Jesus has just performed a long-distance exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman’s daughter (7:24-30). He has just healed a deaf mute in the region of the Decapolis (7:31-37). He has just fed at least four thousand people with just seven loaves of bread in a desolate place (8:1-10).\nAnd yet, in the region of Dalmanutha, the Pharisees have the audacity to demand a sign from heaven, to test Jesus in a manner not unlike the Adversary tested him in the wilderness (Mark 1:13).\nWhy does this demand exasperate Jesus? Surely, given his recent actions, he is not averse to the supernatural in-breaking of God’s kingdom as demonstrated in his miracles. Instead, he astutely recognizes the incompatibility of this sign-seeking pharisaical power-play with true trust, true faith.\nAs Catholic scholar Mary Healy rightfully observes:\n“to insist on irrefutable evidence is really a demand for control, as if to say ‘Force us to believe, so that we will not have to trust you or change our hearts.’ But faith that is compelled is not faith at all” ( The Gospel of Mark, 153).\nI am here reminded of the twin-error of fundamentalism and liberalism when it comes to biblical and theological studies: the insistence that we will only believe what is scientifically verifiable according to the standards we have inherited from Enlightenment Rationalism. The former group thinks everything can be verified, the latter group, very little.\nSure, OK, but we’re not fundamentalists or liberals, at least not on our good days. But, following the example of the disciples in the second half of our passage, don’t we often pine for various other kinds of bread while we misunderstand and ignore the true bread of heaven among us?\nWill we be satisfied by God’s faithful provision of Word and Sacrament to nourish our faith? Or will we long for the more extraordinary manifestations? (As if Word \u0026amp; Sacrament were ordinary!)\nNow, can we, should we long for miracles, for healing?\nYes.\nCan God, will God continue to work wonders, heal sickness, and reverse death in our midst?\nYes.\nBut we must be constantly vigilant, first, that we do not begin to value the healing more than the Healer, the wonders more than the One who works them.\nAnd, second, that we do not, like the Pharisees (and even the disciples, for a time!), close our eyes, ears, and hearts to the miraculous things that God, in Christ, is already and always doing.\nWhether we can discern it or not, God is making the world right again. He will not be thwarted in this mission.\nFriends, God knows that we need some sort of sign, that we cannot keep the faith on our own, unaided. So he has given us sign-seekers His very self, His very Son!\nHe will not bow down to our demands for verification, but he will graciously meet our every need. He will give us enough to trust him along the road to cosmic redemption, even when that road passes through the deepest, darkest valley of doubt.\nSo, as we rightfully pray that God’s Kingdom would come, that His will might be done, let us pray to be satisfied in our King, in God’s Son.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/morning-prayer-homily-mark-8-11-21/","summary":"A homily on Mark 8:11-21 (ESV):\nThe Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him.And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign?

And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,and they found him and said to him,“Everyone is looking for you.”And he said to them, “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.”And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, “If you will, you can make me clean.”Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, “I will; be clean.”And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once,and said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go,show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.”But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter.\nToday’s Gospel lesson consists of at least three distinct episodes.\nIn Mark 1:29-34, Jesus heals Peter’s mother-in-law before a night-long, town-wide round of healings and exorcisms. Then, in Mark 1:35-39, Jesus absconds to a desolate place in the early morning hours to pray. When Peter and the others find him, he reaffirms the preaching focus of his ministry, before taking the disciples along with him as he proclaims the kingdom in Galilee, and demonstrates the kingdom by casting out demons. Finally, in Mark 1:40-45, a leper courageously and somewhat scandalously approaches Jesus, asking to be made clean. Jesus, moved with compassion, grants his request, makes him clean, charges him with silence, and – partially because the request for silence went unheeded – is forced to remain in desolate places to avoid the growing attention his ministry is receiving. Now, what to make of these things? As ministers within the Church, as followers of Jesus, I think we naturally (and rightly) tend to place ourselves in the place of Christ’s disciples when we work our way through Gospel texts.\nHowever, with today’s episodes, I’d like us to consider what we can learn about our vocations from Peter’s mother-in-law, from Jesus himself, and from the leper. These, I believe, demonstrate the importance of service, prayer, proclamation, and worship\nFirst, as with several of Jesus’ miraculous healings, Peter’s mother-in-law is raised from her bed as a foreshadowing of Christ’s resurrection. And although the use of the verb diakoneo to mean “to serve, to wait upon,” is perfectly within the term’s semantic range, we should not fail to notice that the woman provides an apt example of the Christian life: just as she was raised from her bed and began to serve Christ and the disciples, we are raised from our sickness of Sin and Death for a purpose, unto a life of service within Christ’s Church.\nSecondly, after an eventful night of healings and casting out demons, Jesus demonstrates for us the sustaining importance of prayer, even and especially in the lives of ministry big shots, by retreating to a deserted place in the early morning hours to pray to the Father. This lifestyle of prayer is what sustains his healing ministry, and also, thirdly, it sustains his preaching ministry.\nJesus does not lose focus in the midst of growing crowds. He takes time to be alone, to pray – and he relentlessly proclaims the coming Kingdom of God to the people. May we strike the same balance as our Lord in our ministries today.\nService. Prayer. Proclamation. And finally, Worship.\nNotice the leper, condemned to a life of painful illness and perhaps even more painful social exclusion. Taking the risk that Jesus might recoil in horror at his presence, like countless others would have, the leper boldly asks, notice, not primarily for physical healing, but for restoration to the worshiping community!\nWe must keep the biblical, and not the clinical, meaning of “clean” in mind here: acceptable and ready to worship the living God! Jesus reverses the normal contagion movement, transferring his cleanliness to the unclean man, restoring the leper to a life of worship. A beautiful exchange, one which Christ is still willing to make with us today! However, are we as eager as the leper to be healed in order to worship God? To serve God? To pray to God? To proclaim God’s Kingdom?\nLet us not make healing a self-centered occurrence. Christ offers us healing and restoration for this fourfold purpose: service, prayer, proclamation, and worship.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/morning-prayer-homily-mark-1-29-45/","summary":"A homily on Mark 1:29-45 (ESV):\nAnd immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.Now Simon\u0026rsquo;s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons.","title":"Morning Prayer Homily: Mark 1.29-45"},{"content":"A homily on James 2.1-13 (ESV):\n\u0026ldquo;My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,the Lord of glory.For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?\n\u0026ldquo;If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.\u0026rdquo;\nThe verse immediately preceding this morning’s lesson, James 1:27, says this:\n“ religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.”\nSo, purity from the world on one hand, social justice for the oppressed on the other. And yet, in a world which is stained by rampant injustice, these are not two different pursuits, but different facets of the same agenda. Just as we must not allow the manifold sins of the world to stain our souls, we must take care to not allow the deathly and selfish perspectives of the world to stain our vision!\nThe world says that this [slaps Bible] is just a book. We disagree, and see much more.\nThe world says that this [slaps altar] is just a table. Just bread. Just wine. We disagree, and see much more.\nThis [gestures to room] is more than mere meditation. Our God is more than a divinized delusion.\nWe have wiped the world’s mud out of our eyes, to see more clearly. Very good!\nThe world says that a poor, homeless, drug-addled woman is a broken human being. We agree.\nThe world says that a rich, well-dressed, influential man is a less-broken human being, or at least broken in a more comfortable way.\nWe agree. Or at least we’re constantly tempted to in the everyday moments of our lives! Sure, theoretically, in the midst of a homily perhaps, we’d give the right answer. But practically, brothers and sisters, we’re partial. Our vision is still stained.\nWe’ve been wooed by the world’s wisdom.\nWe allow the stratified contents and contours of the world around us to dictate the distinctions among us.\nWe make evil judgments – very subtle, to be sure, but just so, that much more evil judgments! – based on the way things are.\nWe are naïve newcomers to the law of liberty – to the law which gives freedom from the way things are, from the way things have been as long as we can remember, and freedom for the way things once were, in a garden unstained by Sin and Death. A freedom for the way things ought to be, and will be in a city illuminated by Christ himself.\nChrist himself, the One of whom Isaiah spoke thus:\n“There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. \u0026ldquo;And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear, but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins”(Isaiah 11:1-5).\nFriends, the rich are not inherently evil because of their possessions. We know this. They, we, have their own pains and problems, which we will need to address thoughtfully as a church providentially located in one of the world’s most affluent communities – and this is no easy task.\nBut it would be easy for us to allow the stratified realities around us to stain our vision, to keep us short-sighted, to keep us complacent that it would be just as unusual for the homeless and shabbily-clothed to join our community (really join us, not just visit), as it would be for the rich and well-dressed to have joined the earliest Christians, or many of our impoverished brothers and sisters around the world today.\nLet us fight hard against this subtle temptation.\nLet us consider how we should best love and welcome those the world calls, and treats, and sees as “ the least.”\nLet us disagree! And see much more!\nLet us treat them as “ the loved.”\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/morning-prayer-homily-james-2-1-13/","summary":"A homily on James 2.1-13 (ESV):\n\u0026ldquo;My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,the Lord of glory.For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,”have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?","title":"Morning Prayer Homily: James 2.1-13"},{"content":"NOTE: The audio of the following sermon, preached on July 05, 2015 at St. Peter\u0026rsquo;s Anglican Church in Mountain Brook, Alabama, can be found here.

He challenges the experts in Jewish Law, and scandalously stretches the boundaries of family.\nIn chapter 4, he teaches in parables, before commanding and calming the wind and the sea.\nIn chapter 5, he upsets an entire region by casting out a legion of demons. And before we get to chapter 6, he reverses death itself for the sake of a synagogue official, and reverses disease for the sake of a woman with a discharge of blood.\nIn the face of FAITH,Jesus tells the dead to get up. He calls the physically, financially, and relationally destitute one \u0026ldquo;daughter.\u0026rdquo;\nJesus is on a roll.\nJesus is up to something BIG, something NEW. He is bringing in the very kingdom of God, unexpectedly centered around HIMSELF, and NOTHING, NO ONE -\nnot winds, not waves, not Pharisees, not scribes, not disease, not destitution, not demons, not even DEATH - can stand in his way. Well, maybe one thing can.\nOur Text: Mark 6:1-13 We\u0026rsquo;re now on page 841, Mark chapter 6 begins this way:\n\u0026ldquo;He [Jesus] went away from there and came to his hometown [Nazareth], and his disciples followed him.\nAnd on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?”\nAnd they took offense at him.\u0026rdquo;\nNow, before I get to two negative aspects of the Nazarenes\u0026rsquo; reaction, let\u0026rsquo;s consider two positives:\nFirst, in verse 2, they are asking the right questions. They recognize that Jesus has wisdom, mighty works, mighty hands – things which should have reminded them of God himself:\nThe God who, according to Jeremiah (51:15),\n\u0026ldquo;made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the heavens.\u0026rdquo;\nThe God who, according to Deuteronomy (4:34 and 7:19), rescued Israel from the house of slavery with a \u0026quot; mighty hand and an outstretched arm.\u0026quot;\nJesus\u0026rsquo; wisdom and mighty deeds should have persuaded them that God was up to something big, something new.\nThe Creator was re-creating. The Redeemer was rescuing and restoring-- like Jesus had just done with Jairus\u0026rsquo; daughter and the bleeding woman in chapter 5.\nSecond, in verse 3, everything the hometown crowd says is factually correct! Jesus was in fact a carpenter by family trade. And although it\u0026rsquo;s perhaps a slur, or a reference to Joseph\u0026rsquo;s prior death, Jesus is in fact the \u0026ldquo;Son of Mary.\u0026rdquo; He did in fact have siblings. He was in fact from Nazareth. So, what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with the hometown reaction? Let me focus on two things:\nFirst, their reaction shows us that you can ask the right questions with the wrong attitude. Sure, Jesus\u0026rsquo; wisdom and mighty deeds should have persuaded them that God was up to something big, something new – and that they might have to change their lives because of it.\nBut instead, they ask their questions with incredulous skepticism:\nJust who does Jesus think he is?\nWhat right has he to say these things? To act this way?\nWe know who he really is. We watched him grow up!\nHe\u0026rsquo;s just one of us, a normal Nazarene.\nSecond, then, their reaction shows us that you can know the facts and miss the point. In fact, sometimes, you can use the facts in order to miss the point!\nYou can miss Truth with a capital \u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo; by focusing on the lowercase.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;re doing here. The scandalized hometown crowd is bringing up the familiar, comfortable aspects of Jesus\u0026rsquo; existence to give themselves a way out from underneath Jesus\u0026rsquo; powerful claims on them and their future.\nAfter all, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to repent in light of the coming Kingdom of God if this \u0026ldquo;King Jesus,\u0026rdquo; what with his preaching and working wonders like some kind of prophet, is really just the homeboy handyman who\u0026rsquo;s out of his mind, right?\nSo, Jesus responds:\n\u0026ldquo;A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.”\nAnd he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.\nCiting a familiar proverb of the day \u0026ndash; something close to \u0026ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt\u0026rdquo; – Jesus steps into a long tradition of rejected prophets \u0026ndash; those sent by Yahweh to diagnose the sins of his people and point them back to covenant loyalty, but repeatedly rejected because of their intensely unpopular proclamations.\nHear the haunting words of 2 Chronicles 36(:15-16). Commenting upon the faithlessness of Judah, it says:\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place.\nBut they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words and scoffing at his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord rose against his people, until there was no remedy.\u0026rdquo;\n(\u0026hellip;speaking there of the Babylon exile)\nFriends, Jesus is the remedy! He is Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s true Prophet! He brings us back from exile. He is the King in the Kingdom of God, with dominion over demons, disease, and death!\nAnd yet, in the face of stubborn unbelief at Nazareth, Mark is willing to say that Jesus was UNABLE to so a mighty work there.\nSure, he healed a few sick people, but whereas elsewhere in the Gospels it is the crowds who marvel at the mighty words and works of Jesus, here he himself is STUNNED by their unbelief!\nConclusion: Sisters, brothers: You can know the facts, and miss the point. Because FACTS aren\u0026rsquo;t FAITH.\nFAITH is not merely intellectual assent to true propositions about Jesus. Look back at Mark 5, to Jairus and the bleeding woman!\nFaith is about entrusting yourself, your entire life, to Jesus as your King - your only Hope, your only Lord. When you hear \u0026quot; faith,\u0026rdquo; think \u0026quot; faithfulness.\u0026quot; Think \u0026quot; trust.\u0026quot; Think \u0026quot; loyalty.\u0026quot;\nFaith is something absolutely necessary for a relationship to exist. This is true with humans, and it\u0026rsquo;s true with God.\nKnowing the right things, having the Creed memorized backwards and front, is not the same as life-changing loyalty to Jesus Christ.\nAnd, to be sure, faith cannot merely be produced by sheer force of will. We would be nothing but faithless were it not for God\u0026rsquo;s grace.\nBut faith does involve our wills, our entire selves. It is something we commit to. It is something that, by God\u0026rsquo;s grace, we participate in.\nAnd it is something that can be rejected.\nNow, there are some in the world who would be perfectly comfortable to come right out say \u0026quot; I reject and refuse Jesus as Lord.\u0026quot; Unbelief can take the form of outright opposition to Jesus. In the Gospels, we see this in those who want Jesus dead.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not the rejection Jesus receives here at Nazareth. And, my guess is, that\u0026rsquo;s not the refusal he receives from me, from you, either.\nBecause, see, we\u0026rsquo;re prone to the subtler (and therefore greater) rejection of Jesus by making him to \u0026ldquo;just one of us.\u0026rdquo;\nNow, don\u0026rsquo;t misunderstand me. Jesus was and is fully human. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t save us from a distance. He dove from heaven\u0026rsquo;s heights into the muck and mire of our sin-stained existence to bring us back to God.\nBut this salvation involves repentance. It requires turning away from our faithless pursuit of Sin and Death. And it requires the faithfulness of turning toward our faithful God.\nSalvation does not require us getting back to God on our own efforts or merit, but it does entail complete and utter dependence on and allegiance to Jesus as King.\nBut, as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, we can escape total allegiance to King Jesus if he\u0026rsquo;s \u0026quot; just one of us Nazarenes.\u0026quot;\nFriends, King Jesus is not \u0026quot; just one of us\u0026quot;!\nHe has his own agenda of cosmic redemption. He has his own approach, which often appears upside-down to us, because it involves repentance and self-sacrifice, because it includes suffering on a bloodstained Cross before the triumph of the Empty Tomb.\nKing Jesus is not \u0026quot; just one of us\u0026quot;!\nSo the uncomfortable question stands: Are we loyal to King Jesus above all else? Or are we loyal to a \u0026quot; Jesus\u0026quot; we’ve made in our own image? King Jesus is not \u0026quot; middle-to-upper-class-American-Jesus.\u0026quot;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, he cares about the welfare of those around the world and those in this country more than we do. His agenda surely has implications for life here in the United States of America, and it very well might require the hard work of being faithful with many resources and possessions.\nBut, hear me:\nKing Jesus doesn\u0026rsquo;t just want to add a pearly gate to our picket fences. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t just want to stamp a Jesus-approved ticket to heaven on our pre-existent American Dream. He wants us to crucify the American Dream! He calls us to abandon our self-centered agendas of upward mobility, and instead to take up our crosses! To adopt his others-focused agenda of self-sacrificial love! And just like it was for Jesus\u0026rsquo; hometown crowd back then, our easiest way out of this required repentance now is to make Jesus\u0026rsquo; message a little less demanding and his mission a little bit more like our own, until finally, faithlessly – though we may worship Jesus with our lips – in our hearts, we worship only ourselves.\nBriefly notice with me that, in Mark 6:7-13, Jesus sends out his disciples to do what he himself had been doing: preaching repentance, casting out demons, and healing the sick.\nKing Jesus\u0026rsquo; followers carry forward his mission. Do we? Will we, in faith, entrust our entire lives in allegiance to him? No matter the changes? No matter the costs? Will we refuse to make Jesus into \u0026ldquo;just one of us\u0026rdquo;? King Jesus has dominion over disease, demons, and death. Does he have dominion over our dreams and desires? By God\u0026rsquo;s grace \u0026ndash; given to us in the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ our Lord \u0026ndash; By God’s amazing grace, may these things be so, may we follow him faithfully.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/jesus-is-not-just-one-of-us/","summary":"NOTE: The audio of the following sermon, preached on July 05, 2015 at St. Peter\u0026rsquo;s Anglican Church in Mountain Brook, Alabama, can be found here.

I realized there were a great many bones in the valley and they were very dry. 3 He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I said to him, “Sovereign Lord, you know.” 4 Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and tell them: ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. 5 This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones: Look, I am about to infuse breath into you and you will live. 6 I will put tendons on you and muscles over you and will cover you with skin; I will put breath in you and you will live. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”\n7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. There was a sound when I prophesied—I heard a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8 As I watched, I saw tendons on them, then muscles appeared, and skin covered over them from above, but there was no breath in them.9 He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath,—prophesy, son of man—and say to the breath: ‘This is what the sovereign Lord says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these corpses so that they may live.’” 10 So I prophesied as I was commanded, and the breath came into them; they lived and stood on their feet, an extremely great army.11 Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are all the house of Israel. Look, they are saying, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope has perished; we are cut off.’ 12 Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘This is what the sovereign Lord says: Look, I am about to open your graves and will raise you from your graves, my people. I will bring you to the land of Israel. 13 Then you will know that I am theLord, when I open your graves and raise you from your graves, my people. 14 I will place my breath in you and you will live; I will give you rest in your own land. Then you will know that I am the Lord—I have spoken and I will act, declares the Lord.’”\nPsalm: 104:24-34 (NET Bible) 24 How many living things you have made, O Lord!You have exhibited great skill in making all of them;the earth is full of the living things you have made.25 Over here is the deep, wide sea,which teems with innumerable swimming creatures,living things both small and large.26 The ships travel there,and over here swims the whale you made to play in it.27 All of your creatures wait for youto provide them with food on a regular basis.28 You give food to them and they receive it;you open your hand and they are filled with food.29 When you ignore them, they panic.When you take away their life’s breath, they dieand return to dust.30 When you send your life-giving breath, they are created,and you replenish the surface of the ground.31 May the splendor of the Lord endure!May the Lord find pleasure in the living things he has made!32 He looks down on the earth and it shakes;he touches the mountains and they start to smolder.33 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist!34 May my thoughts be pleasing to him!I will rejoice in the Lord.\nPraise the Lord, O my soul!Praise the Lord!\nSong #2: \u0026ldquo;Tongues of Fire\u0026rdquo; by John Mark McMillan Read the Acts passage below and give this song a listen:\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFh1LnNhkEs[/embed]\nSecond Lesson: Acts 2:1-21 (NET Bible) The Holy Spirit and the Day of Pentecost [caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignright\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;800\u0026rdquo;] Pentecôte by Jean II Restout[/caption]\n2 Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. 2 Suddenly a sound like a violent wind blowing came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting. 3 And tongues spreading out like a fire appeared to them and came to rest on each one of them. 4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.\n5 Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem. 6 When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. 7 Completely baffled, they said, “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans? 8 And how is it that each one of us hears them in our own native language? 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, 11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own languages about the great deeds God has done!” 12 All were astounded and greatly confused, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” 13 But others jeered at the speakers, saying, “They are drunk on new wine!”\nPeter’s Address on the Day of Pentecost 14 But Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them: “You men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, know this and listen carefully to what I say. 15 In spite of what you think, these men are not drunk, for it is only nine o’clock in the morning. 16 But this is what was spoken about through the prophet Joel:\n17 ‘ And in the last days it will be,’ God says,‘ that I will pour out my Spirit on all people,and your sons and your daughters will prophesy,and your young men will see visions,and your old men will dream dreams.18 Even on my servants, both men and women,I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.19 And I will perform wonders in the sky above****and miraculous signs on the earth below,blood and fire and clouds of smoke.20 The sun will be changed to darknessand the moon to bloodbefore the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.21 And then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’\nSong #3: \u0026ldquo;Holy Ghost\u0026rdquo; by John Mark McMillan The third song is \u0026ldquo;Holy Ghost\u0026rdquo; by John Mark McMillan.

A clue to the answer lies in the asking of the question, for this act presupposes both a [human] subject and object in a dialectic of self-transcendence.\nAs Robert Jenson notes, “in asking this question, we somehow take up a vantage outside ourselves to make ourselves our own objects, get beyond ourselves to look back at ourselves.”1 The mystery of human existence is “that I am the subject of the object I am and the object of the subject I am.”2\nBut what do I see when I look at myself? At others? At God?\nOn our own, this self-transcendence leaves us humans at the mercy of our own divided desires – searching for definition. But with God, we receive our true humanity in the midst of divine discourse – finding significance in God’s recognition that we are true human beings. The failures of the former approach highlight the successes of the latter.\nDIVIDED DESIRES What Do I See When I Look at Myself? One driven by desire.\nBased upon human behavior, Sigmund Freud rightly notes that the primary human desire is for happiness, which involves the avoidance of the pain and the pursuit of pleasure.3\nHowever, I quickly discover that my own body, the external world, and human relationships oppose my pleasure-drive.4 These oppositions help me to distinguish myself from that which is not me. For example, I am not the ground which hurts when I fall upon it. I am not my parents who fail to provide me with food the moment I desire it. I am not the external frustration and pain which I encounter. I am the one with the frustrated desires.\nDespite the necessity of unfulfilled desires for human development in Freud’s framework, he recognized the unavoidable tensions which human beings experience as the result of two competing drives: Eros and Death.5\nThe former, Eros, is synonymous with libido, the desire for objects for the sake of preservation; while the latter, Death, leads to guilt when internalized, and aggression towards others.6\nWhat Do I See When I Look at Others? Ones who both inform and frustrate my desires.\nNow, on one hand, this is necessary and beneficial for development. As a child, I learn to desire to eat and speak like my parents.\nHowever, as Rene Girard observes, when these imitative or mimetic desires are frustrated, they lead to rivalries.7 When I desire something my neighbor possesses, and my neighbor prevents me from obtaining it, my desire for the object increases. Yet so does my neighbor’s desire, which produces tension between us.\nTherefore, imitation distinguishes human desires from animal instincts for natural needs, yet simultaneously causes the conflicts of human existence. Mimetic desire “is responsible for the best and the worst in us, for what lowers us below the animal level as well as what elevates us above it.”8\nWithout a goal or telos to distinguish between right and wrong desires, I can only take cues from my neighbor and hope for a relative peace. Soon, “choice itself becomes the only thing that is inherently good,” as “all desires, good and bad, melt into the one overriding imperative to consume.”9\nWhen desire is turned in on itself, the pursuit of things (and not even the things themselves!) becomes my temporary respite from the restlessness of my existence. Since I cannot define myself, I go shopping instead.10 And yet, I cannot shop forever.\nWhat Do I See When I Look at God? If human self-transcendence in search of definition is an enclosed circle, the most I will ever see is a personified, projected “god” who is the opposite of my weaknesses and the abstracted absolute of my strengths.\nWhy even bother positing such a “God”? Because I live my life as a narrative awaiting a conclusion – death – which, although it grants meaning to the plot, prevents me, its main actor, from ascertaining its final significance!\nAs Jenson dryly observes, “if the conclusion of our play, hidden as we play our temporal stories in the impenetrable future of death, is nevertheless already enacted, then it can only be enacted in something like the mind of an author, standing above the play and holding what in the play are past and future in a superior present, in the ‘all-at-once-now’ of eternity.”11\nAnd so I trade places with the indefinable God of past theological formulations, defining him against the contours of my own mysterious existence, which I expect him to justify and underwrite.12 Yet if I worship a mere projection, I am left on my own.\nWhat Does It Mean to Be Human? To be at the mercy of our own divided, conflicted, and frustrated desires.\nKarl Barth best describes the failures of self-definition:\n\u0026ldquo;[T]he enterprise of setting up the ‘No-God’ (to justify our existence) is avenged by its success. […] Our conduct becomes governed precisely by what we desire. By a strict inevitability we reach the goal we have set before us. […] And now there is no higher power to protect [humans] from what they have set on high.\u0026ldquo;13\nMy idols (whether myself, my neighbor, or my “God”) exhaust and finally crush me. The attempt to establish my own identity isolates me from myself, whom I do not know; my neighbor, whom I love to hate; my “God,” whom I project; and God, whom I ignore.\nDIVINE DISCOURSE Who am I? What do I see when I look at God?\nTo solve the enigma of my own existence, I must reverse the latter question and expand the former.\nWhat Does God See When He Looks at Me? As Barth rightly inveighs, God “is not the personified but the personifying person – the person on the basis of whose prior existence alone we can speak (hypothetically) of other persons different from Him.”14 Therefore, humans “ought not to be independently what they are in dependence upon God.”15\nAnd because of this, I cannot define myself on my own, but merely describe the characteristics and tensions of my life. My self-transcendence has value only when it transcends the self in the context of a divine discourse.\nAs Eberhard Jüngel claims, “it is only as the human ‘I’ is addressed in such a way that it is simultaneously claimed by something outside itself, that one is really speaking about the human ‘I’ as such.”16\nI am told who I am by God, and thereby enabled to exist in proper relationship to God, to others, and to myself – the very relations that I jeopardize in self-definition.17\nBarth rightly insists that true humanity – true human personality – is only found in one place: the encounter between God and humanity. Therefore, on his own, “man is not a person, but becomes one on the basis that he is loved by God and can love God in return.”18\nIn Jenson’s terms, humans are unique in that God relates to us as “his conversational counterpart,”19 and this divine address to us “is the Son, who is the human person Jesus of Nazareth.”20\nTherefore, as Barth puts it, “the ontological determination of humanity is grounded in the fact that one man among all others is the man Jesus.”21 To be human is to be with God in the person of Christ.22\nGod Sets Us Free, for Himself and for Others If true, the grounding of humanity in divine discourse is a profound liberation, for “our acts [and our desires] cannot determine our being. Only the one who determines being and non-being determines our being.”23\nAnd the Incarnation decisively reassures us that God recognizes us as human beings. Indeed, “the truly human person is the person who is definitively recognized by God, and in that way one who cannot be discredited by anything or anyone, not even by him- or herself.\u0026ldquo;24\nOnce I see that the real God has, in Christ, broken through the veneer of my projected “God” to secure my humanity, I no longer have to drive myself mad trying to secure my humanity. I am freed to worship the true God, enabled to respond to his address in prayer and worship.25\nI am also liberated to relate to my neighbor, not in conflict as a model/rival, but in love as a fellow human.\nThis is the ineluctable result of God’s incarnational address in Jesus Christ, for “to receive myself from God and be directed toward him is therefore to receive myself from and be directed toward a fellow human. And it is to receive myself from and be directed toward a human person who precisely to be himself brings others with him.”26\nBecause he provides the standard by which human desires are evaluated, Christ, who exists completely for God and for others, calls and enables me to reorient my desires toward human flourishing, “the end of human life, which is participation in the life of God.”27\nI can now recognize the dignity of each fellow human, not as a means to my distorted ends, but as one whom God loves, one for whom Christ died.\nAs Martin Luther concluded:\n“as Christians we do not live in ourselves but in Christ and the neighbor. […] As Christians, we live in Christ through faith and in the neighbor through love. Through faith we are caught up beyond ourselves into God. Likewise, through love we descend beneath ourselves through love to serve our neighbor.”28\nThis is self-transcendence as it was meant to be. Divine discourse encompasses God, the self, and the other, grounding both anthropology and ethics.\n(For an overview of what I believe, check out my essay: \u0026ldquo;Theology in Outline.\u0026rdquo;)\nCONCLUSION What does it mean to be human? On my own, I am unable to answer the question.\nIn my efforts to secure my own existence, I can only describe my incoherent estate at the mercy of my divided and frustrated desires. I am a mystery to myself, I love to hate my neighbor, and I project a “God” to comfort myself in light of death.\nYet with God, I am enabled to receive my humanity in the midst of divine discourse, and to respond to his address to me in Christ through prayer, worship, and love of neighbor.\nNOTES: 1 Robert W.

Steele\nINTRODUCTION Just as sin is ontological impossibility, disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. The tension between the undeniable reality of sin and Karl Barth’s theological definition of sin as an impossible possibility parallels the tension between the obvious reality of a fractured church1 and the theological definition of the church as the one body of the one Christ. Two excerpts from the Barthian corpus legitimize this connection. First, in his prepared remarks to the 1937 Second World Conference on Faith and Order in Edinburgh, Karl Barth maintained that\nwe have no right to explain the multiplicity of the churches at all. We have to deal with it as we deal with sin, our own and others’, to recognize it as a fact, to understand it as the impossible thing which has intruded itself, as guilt which we must take upon ourselves, without the power to liberate ourselves from it. We must not allow ourselves to acquiesce in its reality; rather we must pray that it be forgiven and removed, and be ready to do whatever God\u0026rsquo;s will and command may enjoin in respect of it.2\nSecond, almost two decades later, Barth described as “impossible” that which he had earlier declared “unthinkable”3 – that certain Christian communities should “stand in relation to other groups of equally Christian communities in an attitude more or less of exclusion,” by claiming that “their confession and preaching and theology are mutually contradictory” (CD IV/1, 676).4 It is furthermore impossible “that the adherents of the one should be able to work together with those of the other in every possible secular cause, but not to pray together, not to preach and hear the Word of God together, not to keep the Lord\u0026rsquo;s Supper together” (CD IV/1, 676). Barth insists that, “in view of the being of the community as the body of Christ [, the disunity of the church] is – ontologically, we can say – quite impossible; it is possible only as sin is possible” (CD IV/1, 677; emphasis added).\nIn order to describe in Barthian terms what it means for church disunity to be possible only as sin is possible, the purpose of this paper is to correlate Barth’s anthropological concept of sin as ontological impossibility with its parallel ecclesiological concept: disunity as ecclesiological impossibility. I will then conclude by locating this discussion within Barth’s own ecumenical vision – with an eye toward informing and motivating further ecumenical efforts.\n(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: \u0026quot; Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?\u0026quot;)\nSIN AS ONTOLOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY In considering human sin, we must begin with what it means to be human. Although various attempts have been made to define humanity in the spheres of natural science, idealist ethics, existentialist philosophy, and theistic anthropology, Barth claims that these are merely descriptions of the phenomena, and not the essence, of humanity (CD III/2, 71-132).\nAgainst these provisional anthropologies, Barth insists that true humanity – true human personality – is only found in one place, the encounter between God and man, and not in the reaches or intricacies of human emotion, intellect, or will. Therefore, on his own, “man is not a person, but becomes one on the basis that he is loved by God and can love God in return” (CD II/1, 284). This is because God “is not the personified but the personifying person – the person on the basis of whose prior existence alone we can speak (hypothetically) of other persons different from Him” (CD II/1, 285). Most importantly, “the One, the person, whom we really know as a human person, is the person of Jesus Christ, and even this is in fact the person of God the Son, in which humanity, without being or having itself a person, is caught up into fellowship with the personality of God” (CD II/1, 286). Christology determines anthropology, and not the other way around (CD I/1, 131).\nChristological Anthropology\nAlthough Barth grounds the definition of humanity in Christology, he is always careful to preserve a qualitative distinction between Christ’s humanity and humanity in general:\nChristology is not anthropology. We cannot expect, therefore, to find directly in others the humanity of Jesus, and therefore His fellow-humanity, His being for man, and therefore that final and supreme determination, the image of God. Jesus is man for His fellows, and therefore the image of God, in a way which others cannot even approach, just as they cannot be for God in the sense that He is. He alone is the Son of God, and therefore His humanity alone can be described as the being of an I which is wholly from and to the fellow-human Thou, and therefore a genuine I. (CD III/2, 222)\nInstead of framing this distinction between Christ and other humans in terms of a vague moral perfection, Barth portrays Christ as distinctly more human than humans in general – existing both for God and for other humans in a way which is unparalleled. Christ’s existence for other humans is “the direct correlative of His being for God,” and this reveals a correspondence between the existence and love of God ad intra – between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – and the existence and love of God ad extra to humanity (CD III/2, 220).\nHumanity only exists within this Christological correspondence, this analogia relationis (CD III/2, 218-20, 225-6). Specifically, Barth grounds the humanity of individual humans in the notion of a shared sphere with Christ: “the ontological determination of humanity is grounded in the fact that one man among all others is the man Jesus” (CD III/2, 132). Therefore, “to be a man is to be with God,” for no matter what else each individual is, “he is on the basis of the fact that he is with Jesus and therefore with God” (CD III/2, 135). Because the incarnation is the fullest expression of the Creator’s summons to the creature into relationship, it is the ground of the human creature’s being and personality – distinguishing humanity from the other non-human spheres which Christ did not inhabit (CD III/2, 137).\nSin is the Impossible Possibility However, the incarnation is also the source of sin’s absurdity. Because humanity “is not without God, but with God,” true “Godlessness, is not, therefore, a possibility, but an ontological impossibility for man” (CD III/2, 136). When it comes to sin, Barth simultaneously removes it from the definition of what it means to be human, and emphasizes its absurdity as part of human existence – for, although sin undeniably exists, “our being does not include but excludes sin. To be in sin, in godlessness, is a mode of being contrary to our humanity” (CD III/2, 136).\nNevertheless, to make some provisional sense of sin’s existence, Barth claims that the distinction between Creator and creation necessarily entails the possibility of creaturely conflict with God. As opposed to the inherent impossibility of a conflict between God and himself ad intra ,5 “it is a mark of created being as distinct from divine that in it conflict with God and therefore mortal conflict with itself is not ruled out, but is a definite possibility even if it is only the impossible possibility, the possibility of self-annulment and therefore its own destruction” (CD II/1, 503). Positively, this reinforces the creature’s identity as simply that: a creature, owing its existence to God. In fact, “creature freed from the possibility of falling away would not really be living as a creature. It could only be a second God – and as no second God exists, it could only be God Himself” (CD II/1, 503). This distinction does not necessitate actual sin, however, for “sin is when the creature avails itself of this impossible possibility in opposition to God and to the meaning of its own existence” (CD II/1, 503; emphasis added). And, given the Christological and theological basis of human existence, it makes no sense for a human to actualize this possibility, for “if he denies God, he denies himself” and “chooses his own impossibility” (CD III/2, 136). In Barth’s evaluation, this one absurd decision underlies all actions which are usually considered sins, for “every offence in which godlessness can express itself, e.g., unbelief and idolatry, doubt and indifference to God, is as such, both in its theoretical and practical forms, and offence with which man burdens, obscures, and corrupts himself” (CD III/2, 136).\nFor Barth, therefore, sin is not merely moral – it is both ontological and incomprehensible: the inherent contradiction of a nothingness which opposes God as the very ground of all existence and reality (CD II/1, 532; III/3, 351). The value of this definition is its absurdity. Responding to the challenge (from Berkouwer) that defining sin as “nothingness,” an “impossible possibility,” or an “ontological impossibility” seems “to suggest or imply a denial of the reality of evil,” Barth maintains that “it is of a piece with the nature of evil that if we could explain how it may have reality it would not be evil. Nor are we really thinking of evil if we think we can explain this” (CD IV/3, 177). His subsequent clarification is especially instructive for this discussion:\nWhen I speak of nothingness, I cannot mean that evil is nothing, that it does not exist, or that it has no reality. I mean that it exists only in the negativity proper to it in its relationship to God and decisively in God\u0026rsquo;s relationship of repudiation to it. It does not exist as God does, nor as His creatures, amongst which it is not to be numbered. It has no basis for its being. It has no right to the existence which to our sorrow we cannot deny to it. Its existence, significance and reality are not distinguished by any value nor positive strength. The nature underlying its existence and activity is perversion. Its right to be and to express itself is simply that of wrong. In this sense it is nothingness. (CD IV/3, 178)\nSimilarly, the phrase “impossible possibility” is designed to reflect “the absurd possibility of the absurd,” and “ontological impossibility” to state that “the nature of evil as the negation negated by God disqualifies its being, and therefore its undeniable existence, as impossible, meaningless, illegitimate, valueless and without foundation” (CD IV/3, 178). Easily understood definitions of evil are perhaps evil themselves, obfuscating sin’s inherent incomprehensibility.\nGiven the definition of humanity and the absurdity of sin, there is a tension between humanity’s Christological being/essence and its sinful act/form. As Barth puts it, “perhaps the fundamental mistake in all erroneous thinking of man about himself is that he tries to equate himself with God and therefore to proceed on the assumption that he can regard himself as the presupposition of his own being” (CD III/2, 151). However, if there is one presupposition allowed in Barth’s epistemological non-foundationalism, it is the anthropological presupposition of God and his Word as the ground of human being – divine election as the frontier beyond which we cannot look for a human being “not yet summoned” (CD III/2, 151). Just as there is no God behind God, there is no humanity beyond the divine summons, beyond existence in the same sphere inhabited by Christ. It is therefore unthinkable that humanity should try to be the source of its own existence, and yet this is precisely that which occurs.\nFor Barth, this absurdity takes on the character of improper judgment: “all sin has its being and origin in the fact that man wants to be his own judge” (CD IV/1, 220). Although “not all men commit all sins,” everyone commits “this sin which is the essence and root of all other sins” (CD IV/1, 220). Self-justification and the damnation of the others characterize sin as “the arrogance in which man wants to be his own and his neighbour’s judge,” wanting “to be able and competent to pronounce ourselves free and righteous and others more or less guilty” (CD IV/1, 231). Sinful humanity tries to ground its own existence by carving-out its own improper position as judge.\nAtonement’s Intensification of Sin’s Absurdity Yet sin becomes an even further absurdity in light of the atonement. In fact, the tension between humanity’s Christological essence and its sinful form is a driving force in the doctrine of reconciliation, for “the incompatibility of the existence of Jesus Christ with us and us with Him, the impossibility of the co-existence of His divine-human actuality and action and our sinfully human being and activity” must be addressed before we can rest assured “that Jesus Christ belongs to us and we belong to Him, that His cause is our cause and our cause is His” (CD IV/1, 348). As an answer to this predicament, “the event of redemption in Jesus Christ not only compromises this position [of improper human judgment], but destroys it” (CD IV/1, 232).\nThis displacement of humanity by Christ is the source of both its abasement and liberation, the former because, although self-justification always results in a verdict of my own innocence, “He who has acted there as Judge will also judge me, and He and not I will judge others” (CD IV/1, 233). However, it is also the source of freedom from the wearisome and “intolerable nuisance to have to be convincing ourselves that we are innocent, we are in the right” (CD IV/1, 233). With relevance to our subsequent ecclesiological discussion, Barth adds that it is similarly\nan affliction always to have to make it clear to ourselves so that we can cling to it that others are in one way or another in the wrong, and to have to rack our brains how we can make it clear to them, and either bring them to an amendment of their ways or give them up as hopeless, withdrawing from them or fighting against them as the enemies of all that is good and true and beautiful. (CD IV/1, 233-4)\nChrist liberates us from the tiresome task we were never meant to complete.\nFurthermore, in taking our improper place as judge, he also takes away from us the just sentence we merited by taking up that position in the first place. Christ “takes from us our own evil case, taking our place and burdening himself with it,” and “it [therefore] ceases to be our sin” (CD IV/1, 236). Due to this exchange, he “is the unrighteous amongst those who can no longer be so because He was and is for them” (CD IV/1, 237), because he has delivered “sinful man and sin in His own person to the non-being which was properly theirs” (CD IV/1, 253). Christ destroys human faithlessness by taking it to its absurd conclusion: annihilation.\nBecause of this, humans “have no other ground to do evil now that the ground has been cut out from under our feet” (CD IV/1, 243). Considering Christ’s work both for us and in us, Barth maintains that “unfaithfulness to God is a disallowed possibility which can no longer be actualised. It is seen to be the wholly impossible possibility on which we can no longer count, which we see to be eliminated and taken from us by God\u0026rsquo;s omnipotent contradiction set up in us” (CD IV/4, 22). In light of the doctrine of reconciliation, repentance from sin is the only viable human response. Only by ignoring Christ and his accomplished atonement, only by denying the source of our own existence can we presume to have the freedom to sin, to reject God, and to be our own judges.\nDISUNITY AS ECCLESIOLOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY Humanity’s Christological definition results in sin as an absurdity which is intensified by the atonement. The church\u0026rsquo;s Christological definition similarly results in disunity as an absurdity which is intensified by the atonement. As we began with what it means to be human, so we begin with what it means to be the church.\nJust as Barth resists an anthropology that is based upon the mere phenomena of humanity, he resists an ecclesiology that is based upon the mere phenomena of the church. Although the church is “a phenomenon of world history which can be grasped in historical and psychological and sociological terms like any other” (CD IV/1, 652), what the church actually is, “the character, the truth of its existence in time and space, is not a matter of a general but a very special visibility” (CD IV/1, 654). And just as grasping the Christological essence of humanity allows for a true appreciation of humanity’s historical form,6 understanding the Christological essence of the church allows the community to “act confidently on the level of its phenomenal being” (CD IV/1, 660). This includes ecumenical pursuits.\nChristological Ecclesiology For Barth, Christology determines both anthropology and ecclesiology, and there is therefore no “abandonment of the sphere of the [Apostles’] creed” when the transition is made from the second to the third article.7 He offers a conceptual map at this juncture:\nThe Christology is like a vertical line meeting a horizontal. The doctrine of the sin of man is the horizontal line as such. The doctrine of justification is the intersection of the horizontal line by the vertical. The remaining doctrine, that of the Church and of faith, is again the horizontal line, but this time seen as intersected by the vertical. The vertical line is the atoning work of God in Jesus Christ. The horizontal is the object of that work; man and humanity. (CD IV/1, 643)\nThere is therefore a Chalcedonian pattern, 8 not only to Christ’s person, but also to his work. This unavoidably includes the Holy Spirit’s work, awakening and forming the church, which is itself the subjective realization of the eternal election of Jesus Christ (CD IV/1, 667).9 In Barth’s terms: “the one reality of the atonement has both an objective and a subjective side in so far as – we cannot separate but we must not confuse the two – it is both a divine act and offer and also an active human participation in it” (CD IV/1, 643; emphasis added).\nFor this reason, “the history which we consider when we speak of the Christian community and Christian faith is enclosed and exemplified in the history of Jesus Christ” (CD IV/1, 644). Barth takes seriously the New Testament language of the church as Christ’s “body,” and claims that “the community is the earthly-historical form of existence of Jesus Christ himself” (CD IV/1, 661). As Christ is the head of his body, the church, he is the ground of its particular existence. Just as the incarnation grounds human existence, it determines ecclesiological existence. And because Christology and ecclesiology are inseparably intertwined, the Chalcedonian pattern which unites the church with the person of Christ also applies to the relationship between the church’s being and its act – between its invisible essence and its visible form.\nDisunity is the Impossible Possibility This union, however, parallels the aforementioned tension between humanity’s essence and its form, given its Christological definition and the absurdity of sin. As Bender notes, “Barth’s dialectical understanding of the church as both an invisible and visible reality, an event of the Holy Spirit and a historical entity, leads naturally to his dialectical understanding of the marks of the church: the church as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.”10 Within the context of the first mark, there is a tension between the church’s being/essence as one, and its act/form as many.\nCredo unam ecclesiam(I believe one church) entails that there is “only one Church. This means that it belongs to the being of the community to be a unity in the plurality of its members, i.e., of the individual believers assembled in it, and to be a simple unity, not having a second or third unity of the same kind side by side with it” (CD IV/1, 668). This follows not just a Christological pattern, but a Trinitarian one as well, for\nIn all the riches of His divine being the God who reconciled the world with Himself in Jesus Christ is One. Jesus Christ, elected the Head of all men and as such their Representative who includes them all in Himself in His risen and crucified body is One. The Holy Spirit in the fulness and diversity of His gifts is One. In the same way His community as the gathering of the men who know and confess Him can only be one. (CD IV/1, 668)\nThis is the source of the church’s unity, in the midst of legitimate plurality, between the visible and invisible church and between the ecclesia militans and the ecclesia triumphans (CD IV/1, 669).11 The only other legitimate church plurality is the existence of “geographically separated and therefore different congregations.” (CD IV/1, 671). If the church is to exist “in essential accordance with its commission it has to take place in many localities,” then this necessarily entails a differentiation which corresponds to “its environment and history and language and customs and ways of life and thought as conditioned by the different localities, and also to its personal composition” (CD IV/1, 671). Because it is grounded in God’s Triune unity, the church’s unity does not necessitate homogeneity, and Barth grants that each local congregation should exist within the particularities of its own context.\nHowever, this cannot entail any sort of basic or essential difference between one local congregation and another, for “each in its own place can only be the one community beside which there are no others. Each in and for itself and with its local characteristics can only be the whole, as others are in their own locality” (CD IV/1, 672). No other legitimate plurality within the church exists, for “any other plurality means the co-existence of Churches which are genuinely divided” – churches that, at best will kindly “tolerate one another as believing differently, and at worst they will fight against one another, mutually excluding each other with some definiteness and force” (CD IV/1, 675).\nAnd yet this is exactly the scandalous reality of the church. Although there are myriad reasons for ecclesiological divisions throughout the ages, Barth’s distillation of myriad human sins to improper judgment as “the essence and root of all other sins ” helps to make sense of the scandal of the fragmented church. Just as humans demonstrate the sinful tension between their essence and form by improperly justifying themselves and damning others, the church demonstrates the sinful tension between its unified being and its divided act when individual Christian communities justify their own existence over against the existence of other Christian communities. Because this is the case, Barth is even willing to claim that the church’s formal division has essential implications: “in its visible and also in its invisible being, in its form and also in its essence, the one community of Jesus Christ is not one” (CD IV/1, 679). While it is expected that every Christian community would claim an individual encounter with its Lord which justifies its own existence, this can quickly become a perverse insistence that the “Yes” of Christ has been exclusively spoken to them. This “claim to be identical with the one Church in contrast to the others, and in this sense to be the only Church” entails a delegitimation, whether implicit or explicit, of every other community’s claim to stand under the “Yes” of Christ (CD IV/1, 683-4). The local congregation, instead of existing in harmony with and as a manifestation of the one church, becomes a ghetto by restricting the cosmic boundaries of Christ’s church to its own four walls.\nWhile there may be legitimate human explanations for such divisions, there are no acceptable theological ones, Barth claims, for a “plurality of Churches in this sense means a plurality of lords, a plurality of spirits, a plurality of gods” – a practical denial of the church’s theoretical confession of the singular unity of the Triune God (CD IV/1, 675). Just as it is absurd for humans to oppose God as the very ground of their existence, it is equally absurd for the church to divide in denial of the unity of God.\nAtonement’s Intensification of Disunity’s Absurdity Just as the atonement intensifies the anthropological absurdity of sin, it intensifies the ecclesiological absurdity of disunity. As Barth puts it, the previously-described exclusive claim of a Christian community to be the only church “has been dashed out of hand by the One who is the unity of the Church” (CD IV/1, 684). In making an end of the nothingness of human sin, Christ has also delivered up disunity to destruction, for “in Him it was all humanity in its corruption and lostness, its earthly-historical existence under the determination of the fall, which was judged and executed and destroyed, and in that way liberated for a new determination, for its being as a new humanity” (CD IV/1, 663). The unity which is necessarily implied in Barth’s Christological description of election is realized in the church. Members of the community “were one in God’s election (Eph 1:4), were and are one in the fulfilment of it on Golgotha, are one in the power of His resurrection, one in Jesus Christ…His body together in their unity and totality” (CD IV/1, 664). Most succinctly, “there is only one Christ, and therefore there is only one body of Christ” (CD IV/1, 666). Disunity in the church is therefore absurd, because it denies the definition of the church as Christ’s body, and the reality of reconciliation as Christ’s work.\nCONCLUSION: TOWARD A BARTHIAN ECUMENISM I have endeavored to demonstrate the significance of Karl Barth’s remark that disunity in the church “is only possible as sin is possible,” by showing the structural parallels between his anthropological claim that sin is ontological impossibility and the claim that disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. Yet the value of this correlation for ecumenism is not readily apparent until it is situated within Barth’s own ecumenical vision.\nFor Karl Barth, the Chalcedonian pattern of both Christology and ecclesiology applies when addressing the tension between the church’s essence and form.12 On one hand, the solution to ecclesiological disunity must not entail a docetic escapism which unifies the church at the expense of its earthly-historical form. No matter how frustrated ecumenists become, they must not abandon their ecclesiological traditions to create a formless Christianity whose only members are themselves. Because the church’s external divisions result from essential, inward fractures, “neither individuals nor the whole Church can overcome it by a flight to the invisible, but only by a healing of both its visible and its invisible hurt” (CD IV/1, 678). On the other hand, because “what is demanded is the unity of the Church of Jesus Christ, not the externally satisfying co-existence and co-operation of different religious societies,” Barth is suspicious of ebionitic approaches to church unity which approach the unification of the church as the unification of any other human communities, looking for the least common denominators upon which to build pragmatic associations (CD IV/1, 678).\nInstead, Barth maintains that the pursuit of church unity must be an indirect pursuit – not an end in itself, but an unavoidable consequence of each Christian community sincerely pursuing the call of its Lord, and each individual doing so from a sober and humble loyalty to one’s particular confession (CD IV/1, 679).13 Barth asserts that “if only each church will take itself seriously, ‘itself and Christ within it,’ then even if there be no talk of union movements in it, even if there be no change at all in its order and its way of worship, the one Church would be in that single church a present reality and visible.”14 Because Christ, not Christians, is the ground of the church’s unity, an individual community can exhibit the unity of the church, even within a fractured ecclesiological landscape, “if in its ordinances it is zealous for Christ.”15\nAnd yet this is the most difficult ecumenism of all, for it entails rigorous self-examination within each community, which must be willing to ask itself constantly whether it has legitimate reasons to exist as a particular, differentiated Christian community, or whether it should redefine (or abandon) its boundaries for the sake of church unity (CD IV/1, 680-1). I believe the correlation between sin as ontological impossibility and disunity as ecclesiological impossibility is necessary precisely at this point in the ecumenical equation, for each community’s self-examination and pursuit of Christ’s unifying summons will only be as rigorous as its understanding of the absurdity of church fragmentation. Just as sinful humanity denies the ground of its own existence, so also a divided and divisive church denies its identity as Christ’s body and the reality of the atonement. Unless the disunity of Christ’s body is seen as an unacceptable scandal, the schisms will remain, and each community’s confession, “ credo unam ecclesiam,” will mean nothing more than “we believe ourselves.”\nNOTES: 1 As Bender notes, “the referent for Barth’s term [whether ‘community’ or ‘church’] must be determined by context,” whether it refers to the local congregation, the institution, or the universal body of Christ. See Kimlyn Bender, Karl Barth’s Christological Ecclesiology (Hampshire/Burlington: Ashgate Publishing, 2005; repr. Eugene, OR: Cascade, 2013), 13. I have followed Bender’s approach in that, throughout this study, “church” is only capitalized in quotations, when Barth himself did so. 2 Karl Barth, The Church and the Churches (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1936; repr., 2005), 22-3. Emphasis added. 3 Note the similarities: “It is then unthinkable that to those multiplicities which are rooted in unity we should have to add that which tears it in pieces; unthinkable that great entire groups of communities should stand over against each other in such a way that their doctrines and confessions of faith are mutually contradictory…. that the adherents of the one should be at one with those of another in every conceivable point except that they are unable to pray together, to preach and hear God\u0026rsquo;s word together, and to join together in Holy Communion.” Barth, The Church and the Churches, 24. 4 The reference is to Vol. IV, pt. 1 of Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics. (eds. G.W. Bromiley and T.F. Torrance; trans. G.W. Bromiley; 5 vols in 14 parts; Edinburgh: T \u0026amp; T Clark, 1936-77; repr., Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2010). All references to the Church Dogmatics appear parenthetically in the following form: “CD I/1, 1.” 5 “It is a mark of the divine nature as distinct from that of the creature that in it a conflict with Himself is not merely ruled out, but is inherently impossible. If this were not so, if there did not exist perfect, original and ultimate peace between the Father and the Son by the Holy Spirit, God would not be God. Any God in conflict with Himself is bound to be a false God” CD II/1, 503. 6 Consider Barth’s positive, yet provisional, appraisal of the phenomena-based anthropologies: “In this way and in this sense, then, a knowledge of man which is non-theological but genuine is not only possible but basically justified and necessary even from the standpoint of theological anthropology…. It cannot, of course, lead us to the knowledge of real man. But it may proceed from or presuppose a knowledge of real man” CD III/2, 200-2. 7 “It is significant that at this point, the transition from the second to the third article, the word credo is specifically mentioned. It tells us that we can know the man who belongs to Jesus Christ only in faith.” CD IV/1, 644. 8 Bender credits George Hunsinger with identifying this theme, based upon Barth’s own description of the ecumenical councils’ doctrinal decisions as “guiding lines for an understanding of [Christ’s] existence and action, not to be used, as they have been used, as stones for the construction of an abstract doctrine of His ‘person’” (CD IV/1, 127). See Bender, Christological Ecclesiology, 3. 9 As Bender helpfully notes, “there is, then, not only a direct Christological analogy between Christ and the community, but an indirect Trinitarian and pneumatological one, in that, as the Spirit binds together the Father and the Son (in the Trinity); and as the Spirit binds together the Word and flesh of Christ (in the incarnation); so also the Holy Spirit binds together Christ and the community.” Bender, Christological Ecclesiology, 205. However, in touching so lightly upon the work of the Holy Spirit in this paper, I share Barth’s exclamatory sentiment: “How gladly we would hear and know and say something more, something more precise, something more palpable concerning the way in which the work of the Holy Spirit is done!” (CD IV/1, 649). Furthermore, despite the brief mention of election, it is significant that Barth grounds the unity between Christology and ecclesiology, not in the event of Pentecost, preaching, or the sacraments, but in the election of Jesus Christ from all eternity. The church “became His body, they became its members, in the fulfillment of their eternal election in His death on the cross of Golgotha, proclaimed in His resurrection from the dead” (CD IV/1, 667). 10 Bender, Christological Ecclesiology, 181. 11 It is also the source of the unity between Israel and the Church, which Barth describes as the “two forms and aspects (CD II, 2, § 34, 1) of the one inseparable community in which Jesus Christ has His earthly-historical form of existence, by which He is attested to the whole world, by which the whole world is summoned to faith in Him.” CD IV/1, 669-70. 12 I am indebted to Bender’s helpful description of Barth’s critical use of a docetic/ebionitic framework. See Bender, Christological Ecclesiology, 7. 13 See also Barth, The Church and the Churches, 51-2. 14 Barth, The Church and the Churches, 55. 15 Barth, The Church and the Churches, 56.

(PDF: The Hope of the Holy Innocents)\nToday is December 28 (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “ The Slaughter of the Innocents,” the killing of the baby boys of Bethlehem by King Herod.\nThe Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back to at least the fifth century. In the fourth century, Chromatius described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf. Around the same time, St. Augustine claimed that these nameless victims, “ whom Herod’s cruelty tore as sucklings from their mothers’ bosom are justly hailed as the infant martyr flowers, the first buds of the church killed by the frost of persecution. They died not only for Christ but in his stead.”\nWhat if we knew the names of the victims of Herod’s infamous, paranoid rage?\nWhat if the cries of Bethlehem took place today in Birmingham?\n…For [REDACTED (NAMES OF BOYS IN CHURCH AGED TWO AND UNDER)]\n…For [REDACTED]\n…For [REDACTED]\n…For [REDACTED]\n…For [REDACTED]\n…For [REDACTED]\n…For [REDACTED]\nMay it never, ever be.\nBut what if such a tragedy took place inside our community?\nBright young lives, cut short by darkness.A deafening silence replaces the cries of the young.The tears of the parents a lingering reminder of the tears of their lost children.\nMay it never, ever be.\nBut it has been… and it frequently is… true.The small and the young are slaughtered by the big and supposedly powerful:\nThe Hebrew babies, by Pharaoh. Bethlehem’s young, by Herod. Babies not yet born, by their parents. Babies already born, by their parents. Sandy Hook Elementary students, by Adam Lanza. Students in Peshawar, by the Pakistani Taliban. Pakistani children, by U.S. drone strikes. Central American children, by gangs and drug lords… May it never, ever be?\nLord , have mercy! Lord Jesus, come quickly! For these things so often ARE.\nYou do not have to look far to spot evil.You do not have to look much further to spot violence that victimizes children.\nThis is not an ancient Egyptian or Judean issue,it is an issue for today – an issue for eternity.If it is not happening today in our community,it IS happening right now in some community.\nConsider this, today, as we commemorate the “Holy Innocents” of Bethlehem– nameless to us,but called by name by both their parents and their God.\nConsider this, today, as we contemplate how the Incarnation unveils both the source of and the desperate need for hope…the brilliant light of Christ against the dark backdrop of intense evil and incomprehensible suffering.\nLet us pray…\nO ALMIGHTY God, who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast ordained strength, and madest infants to glorify thee by their deaths: Mortify and kill all vices in us, and so strengthen us by thy grace, that by the innocency of our lives, and constancy of our faith even unto death, we may glorify thy holy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\nI’ve said that the Incarnation unveils both the source of and the desperate need for hope.Let us consider both together as we turn to today’s Gospel text, Matthew 2:13–18.\nThe structure of this passage is easy enough to ascertain.\nIt begins, in vv. 13-15, by depicting the flight of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus from Bethlehem to Egypt – concluding in v. 15 with a quotation from Hosea 11:1. Then, in vv. 16-18, we witness the grisly scene at Bethlehem, which is then linked by Matthew to a quotation from Jeremiah 31:15. Although this sermon will only address these 6 verses, vv.19-23 complete the symmetry of these events by depicting the return of the family from Egypt to Nazareth in Galilee. First, then:\nI. IN TELLING OF THE FLIGHT TO EGYPT,VV. 13-15 PORTRAY JESUS AS THE NEW MOSES, THE TRUE ISRAEL,AND THE SOURCE OF HOPE. Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”\nAnd he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod.\nThis was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet,\n“Out of Egypt I called my son.”\nA. THE FLIGHT Verse 13 begins by referring to the departure of the wise men, after offering their now-famous gifts. And just as they were warned in a dream to take an alternate route home to avoid Herod, so Joseph is commanded in a dream by a messenger of the Lord to flee to Egypt to avoid Herod.\nHerod the Great’s attempts to destroy the Christ-child here echo the much earlier attempts of Pharaoh to kill Moses in the book of Exodus – first, generally and unwittingly, by ordering all Hebrew baby boys to be cast into the Nile (Exod. 1:22); and then, even more specifically, when Pharaoh tried to kill Moses after Moses’ had murdered a nameless Egyptian (Exod. 2:15). In this way, Matthew links Herod with Pharaoh, and Jesus with Moses.\nTherefore , although Egypt was, in the immediate sense, a natural destination to escape Herod’s jurisdiction, Matthew is drawing deeper connections. Egypt was the house of slavery from which the nation of Israel was redeemed. It is significant, then, that the Son of God goes there as a refugee before returning to the land of Israel to redeem the world.\nThe urgency of the angel’s command matches the urgency with which it was obeyed. The family made the approximately 90 mile journey, beginning under cover of darkness. And they obediently remained there u\nntil receiving further instructions - until Herod would later die, allowing them to return and to journey to Nazareth in Galilee.\nB. THE FULFILLMENT And then Matthew says that these things happened in order that that which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet – in this case, the prophet Hosea – might be fulfilled: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” As I have mentioned, this comes from Hosea 11, from a beautiful prophetic passage which begins by speaking of Israel and the Exodus – the formative event in the birth of the young nation, the young “son” of God.\nThis way of speaking about Israel as God’s son comes from the book of Exodus itself, when Moses is told to tell Pharaoh “Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son, and I say to you ‘Let my son go that he may serve me” (4:22–23a).\nThis is a metaphorical use of the word “son” to refer to the relationship between Yahweh and his people. However, as the Exodus passage continues, if Pharaoh refused to let Yahweh’s metaphorical firstborn son go, Yahweh would kill Pharaoh’s literal firstborn son.\nLiteral and metaphorical sonship collide in the person of Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God who fully shares the divine nature of his Father, and he is also the Son of God who fulfills the calling and the destiny of the nation of Israel.Here his sojourn in Egypt fulfills the Exodus. Later, in Matthew 4, his wilderness temptation fulfills the Old Testament wilderness wanderings.Jesus is not just the New Moses. He is the True Israel.\nOnly when divine sonship is seen as an important biblical theme does this Hosea quotation make sense. Matthew is not proof-texting here, because in the Hosea passage, the “son” immediately turns away from Yahweh to idolatry in the very next verse!Instead , Matthew is claiming that the link Hosea made between the people of Israel and God’s “son” finds its fullest meaning – it is fulfilled and completed – in the person of Jesus.\nAlready , early in Matthew’s Gospel, we get the sense that Christ is going to change things, He’s going to complete God’s mission of setting the world right again.\nI wish I could end there. However,\nII. IN TELLING OF THE SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS, VV. 16-18 REVEAL THE DESPERATE NEED FOR HOPE. Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.\nThen was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:\n“A voice was heard in Ramah,\nweeping and loud lamentation,\nRachel weeping for her children;\nshe refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”\nA. THE MASSACRE According to estimates, the number of baby boys killed in the region of Bethlehem would have been between 10 and 30.In the course of the Church’s commemoration of this event, the number has grown drastically – to 14,000; 64,000; or even 144,000.\nOf course , some have gone to the opposite extreme and claimed that this event never actually happened.Matthew must have been making this story up to draw the connections between Jesus and Moses. He had the Old Testament texts and made a story to match.\nThat’s one way around this difficult text,but I think it’s a cop-out.\nMatthew quotes Jeremiah 31:15 and therefore creates a link in reverse to the Old Testament passage. However, in a certain sense, this link only works in one direction. That is, if one only had Jeremiah 31:15, it is obviously not a straightforward prophecy of a bloodthirsty ruler killing babies.\nMatthew is using the Old Testament to make some sense of this senseless slaughter, not to create it.\nFurthermore , this massacre at Bethlehem fits quite well with the historical portrait we have of Herod – especially in his later years. Herod was crazy. If he thought you were a threat to his power, goodbye! The man even killed three of his own sons.\nIt is therefore not altogether surprising that, as terrible as it was, the deaths of a dozen or so babies in the hill town of Bethlehem would not have made it into the secular history books of that violent period.\nI still think it happened.\nDoes that make you feel any better?\nPerhaps a victory for the historical reliability of the Gospel accounts, but at what cost?\nWe’re still left with bereaved mothers and bloodstained cribs.\nI don’t feel any better.\nAlthough I’m sure I’ll find this passage even more poignant when, Lord-willing, I am a parent myself someday,some of its true weight hit me for the first time when, after reading the passage together, my wife (a pediatric nurse) started to tear-up and, after a long silence, said: “ I don’t understand why those children had to die for Jesus to come… If I’m honest, it makes me angry.”\nShe has a point, right? If God could save Jesus from bloodthirsty Herod, why not the Bethlehem babies? Didn’t the angel of the Lord have enough free time to show up in the dreams of the other Bethlehem parents? Doesn’t this event, like all the others I mentioned in my introduction, rightly prompt the question, perhaps asked with a tone of weeping and loud lamentation: “Why, God? Why?!”?\nB. THE FULFILLMENT This passage sticks with me partially because my wife’s name is Rachel. She has wept, as a nurse, over the often senseless suffering of her patients. And she is not alone. Matthew draws our attention to Jeremiah 31:15, depicting Rachel – the wife of Jacob, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin – as weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are no more. “Why, God? Why?!”\nThe original context of this passage is the Babylonian invasion and exile of the people of Judah. Ramah, just 5 miles north of Jerusalem, was where the exiles were assembled in 586 B.C. for the journey into Babylon.\nThe prophet Jeremiah witnessed Jerusalem destroyed and its inhabitants terrorized. He poetically depicts Rachel, the Old Testament’s paradigmatic and idealized mother of the people of Israel, as weeping for her children as they go into exile.\nImagine Eve, the mother of the living, weeping as she looks forward from the past to see all the horrible effects of the exile from Eden, and you’ll get a similar idea.\n“Mary Consoles Eve”; Crayon and pencil by Sr. Grace Remington, OCSO. Copyright 2005, Sisters of the Mississippi Abbey\nAlthough some think Matthew used this verse due to the geographical proximity of Rachel’s grave to Bethlehem, it’s mo\nre likely that the connection is theological.\nThe connection is HOPE.\nJeremiah 31:15, although tragic, occurs in a hopeful section of the book. In fact, the chapter of Jeremiah 31 is best known for its depiction in vv.31–40 of the New Covenant! The quoted verse about Rachel weeping is followed by these two verses:\nThus says the Lord:\n“ Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work, declares the Lord, and they shall come back from the land of the enemy.\nThere is hope for your future, declares the Lord, and your children shall come back to their own country.”\nRachel was weeping over the exile.And she is promised that it will one day end.The exiles will return – as they began to do,48 years later, in 538 BC.\nIt is important to realize that this “prophecy” did not somehow cause the tragedy at Bethlehem.As John Calvin notes in his Gospel commentary, because Jeremiah’s oracle had its own fulfillment regarding the exile to Babylon and the subsequent return, “Matthew does not mean that it foretold what Herod would do, but that the coming of Christ occasioned a renewal of that mourning, which had been experienced, many centuries before,” by the people of Israel.\nBecause , you’ll notice, the people of Israel were still in exile. Sure, five centuries had passed since they had physically returned, but they still lived under a foreign ruler, not a son of David, who could enter the city of David at will and have the baby boys slaughtered.\nWe have an encounter between two kings in this passage. The first, a crazed old man, is the illegitimate king of the Jews – deathly afraid of pretenders to his throne. The second, a vulnerable human baby, is the legitimate king of the Jews and of the world.\nWhen faced with the latter, the former should have bowed the knee – as did the wise men (who, you’ll notice, came from the exile-lands of Babylon and Persia). Instead, Herod draws the sword, and the Son of God goes into exile, a refugee in the ancient land of slavery from which his people were bought and delivered by Yahweh.\nWith the mothers of Bethlehem, Rachel was still weeping.\nHer children were not yet home.\nCONCLUSION What do we make of this?\nAlthough the Jeremiah quotation points in the direction of hope, you’ll notice that Matthew leaves it hanging on a note of lamentation.\nMight I suggest that the yearly Feast of the Holy Innocents is our liturgical antidote to a merely superficial and sentimental Christmas season?\nThe realities of Bethlehem, of the Christian faith, and of our lives, often have more blood, sweat, and tears in them than we care to admit – more pain than our idyllic notions can contain.\nThe Incarnation is glorious, but it’s also messy. Because we are messy! The human race – this very room! – is filled with Herods. We may not all kill babies out of fear, but our fear does drive us toward death. Think of it.\nWhat do our fears – of rejection, of failure, of powerlessness – drive us to do to rupture our relationships with God and with our fellow humans? What do our fears – of intimacy, of scarcity, of being taken advantage of – prevent us from doing to foster those same relationships? Sisters and brothers, we Christians cannot afford an escapist religion of mere sentimentality which is out of touch with this broken and twisted world.\nWe cannot afford an escapist religion because we do not worship an escapist God! Now , remember: evil is incomprehensible. It is the impossible possibility – a headlong dive, away from the source of Life and Light, into the arms of nothingness and darkness. It makes no sense!\nTherefore , some neat and tidy “answers” to the problem of evil can themselves be evil – by trying to explain that which cannot be explained!\nDon’t offer or seek such “answers.” It’s better to remain silent, or to cry out “Why, God? Why?!” Job did. Jesus did.\nJESUS DID…on the Cross!\nEvil cannot and should not be explained. But it can, has been, and will be defeated! Although it does not lessen the tragedy, King Jesus, the commander of heaven’s armies, did not abandon these baby boys, his very first standard-bearers, as Peter Chrysologus noted. Instead, he sent them on ahead of himself into victory.\nAlthough it does not lessen the tragedies we face, our God does not escape evil and suffering at our expense.\nSure , he escaped Herod once…in order to make it to the Cross,where he took Sin and Death to their bitter end in our stead.\nHe went into the furthest and fullest exile – the grave –in order to bring us back from our exile.\nThis return will look a bit different from the return in 538 BC, for it will be full and final.\nAs our second lesson today describes it:\nBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man.\nHe will dwell with us, and we will be his people, and God himself will be with us as our God.\nHe will wipe away every tear from our eyes, from the eyes of Bethlehem’s mothers and from the eyes of Bethlehem’s babies.\nAnd death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”\nGod, the Alpha and the Omega, whose justice and mercy far outstrip our own, will make all things new.\nGod will be our God.\nAnd because of His Son – who joined us in our distant depths, and went into exile in our stead to bring us home – We will be God’s daughters and sons.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/the-hope-of-the-holy-innocents/","summary":"Your browser does not support the audio element.

I said to you as you lay there in your blood, “Live!” I said to you as you lay there in your blood, “Live!” I made you plentiful like sprouts in a field; you grew tall and came of age so that you could wear jewelry.

I dressed you in embroidered clothing and put fine leather sandals on your feet. I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk. I adorned you with jewelry. I put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck. I put a ring in your nose, earrings on your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head. You were adorned with gold and silver, while your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidery. You ate the finest flour, honey, and olive oil.

( Ezekiel 16:4-14, NET)\n---\nNotice that God\u0026rsquo;s immanence, his willingness to suffer alongside us (and in our stead, through Christ), doesn\u0026rsquo;t negate his hatred for sin. Instead, I\u0026rsquo;d argue that God\u0026rsquo;s immanence intensifies his negative reaction to Sin and Death as his cosmic enemies! Emmanuel, God with us, sees our sickness for what it truly is. It\u0026rsquo;s not something to be trifled with, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t just upset God because it \u0026ldquo;breaks his list of rules.\u0026rdquo; No, sin breaks God\u0026rsquo;s good creation.

It\u0026rsquo;s long, and I swear toward the end. Sorry.)\n\u0026ldquo;It is better to go to a funeral than a feast. For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart. Sorrow is better than laughter, because sober reflection is good for the heart.\u0026rdquo; (Ecclesiastes 7:2-3)\nTimothy Steele The juxtaposition is staggering. The funeral of the man I most associate with laughter and joy. It hurts. No Steele family gathering was complete without hearing his boisterous laugh, receiving one of his legendary bear hugs, and - if you were lucky - getting one heck of a sloppy kiss on the cheek.\nHis greetings were the most genuine. I always knew when Uncle Tim had arrived. And whenever I arrived, he made me feel like my presence mattered, like he had missed me, like he was proud of me.\nMy Uncle Tim was one of the first people in the room to hold me when I was born. Although I can\u0026rsquo;t remember it, he was there on the very first day of my life. Growing up, his house was always a welcome place to hang out with my cousins. He was like a second dad, and his children like a second set of siblings.\nSpeaking of dad, my Uncle Tim was used by God to help my dad out of his habits and addictions and into an encounter with Jesus Christ. At the funeral, my dad spoke of it in terms of Tim saving him from drowning. I will perhaps never know how much in my life I owe to my Uncle Tim being there for his younger brother, Patrick, putting his reputation on the line to guide and love my dad toward Christ.\nAlso, it meant a lot to me that my Uncle Tim made it out to my wedding in Pennsylvania in August 2012. Whenever my wife and I watch our wedding video, one of our favorite parts is when Uncle Tim\u0026rsquo;s voice booms out from the back of the church after we finished our duet of Be Thou My Vision. Amidst the applause, he cries out in a weepy voice: \u0026ldquo;That was beautiful!!!\u0026rdquo; He is intertwined with the memories of one of the happiest days of my life.\nMany more stories could be and have been told about Timothy Steele. However, there\u0026rsquo;s one memory in particular that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to get out of my head these past days since hearing of my uncle\u0026rsquo;s untimely death. It happened in the garage of Grandma Steele\u0026rsquo;s house during a family gathering when her health was declining, if I remember correctly. Amidst the normal hilarious and loud stories, the conversation took a serious turn, and my Uncle Tim spoke of the pain he felt when he looked back upon times in his life when he had turned his back on Jesus, so to speak.\nNow, he didn\u0026rsquo;t speak of his regrets in terms of not knowing any better when he was younger. He didn\u0026rsquo;t speak of the pain of violating a general sense of right and wrong, but of the nagging sense that at various times he had let a person down\u0026hellip;the person of Christ.\nEncouragement in the Midst of Pain Here\u0026rsquo;s why I find that story encouraging in the midst of pain: You don\u0026rsquo;t much regret letting down people for whom you don\u0026rsquo;t much care. And even though we have all, to the very last one of us, let Jesus down, he never abandons us. His love makes my Uncle Tim\u0026rsquo;s love pale in comparison, and he is now showing Tim even more grace than Tim showed to all of us each day.\nIf you ever met my Uncle Tim, you know of his gracious love toward every single person he met. These past few days have been filled with stories about this man who was a force of nature, always ready to extend his gregarious love toward even, if not especially, \u0026ldquo;discarded and used-up people,\u0026rdquo; as my cousin Whitney put it. And as my Uncle John put it, \u0026quot; Tim loved you like Jesus does.\u0026quot;\nI was struck by viewing those loving, gracious memories of my Uncle Tim in light of the relationship revealed to me in that serious conversation in the garage. That is, to realize that my Uncle Tim was such a uniquely loving person, not just because he thought it was a good idea or because he just had so much love on his own, but because of the love he had received from Christ. To realize that the intense love which characterized every personal encounter with my Uncle flowed from the intense love he had first and continually experienced in his personal encounter with the crucified-and-risen Jesus Christ.\nUnlike many, my Uncle Tim understood that the Gospel of Christ doesn\u0026rsquo;t just make a difference in the \u0026ldquo;afterlife,\u0026rdquo; but that it makes a difference in the here-and-now! That if knowing Christ makes no difference in how you treat the flesh-and-blood people around you who are made in God\u0026rsquo;s image, then you probably don\u0026rsquo;t know Christ. The eternal life spoken of in the Gospel doesn\u0026rsquo;t begin the day you die, it began the day Christ died and rose from the grave.\nI often worry that Christian pronouncements about the good news of Jesus Christ strike others as hollow, fake, and escapist - especially in the context of a funeral. How can trite truisms about Jesus be relevant in the midst of so much pain?\nBut my Uncle Tim\u0026rsquo;s life on earth, painful ending and all, was not a trite truism. You know if you knew Timothy Steele. He demonstrated what faith looks like \u0026ndash; that it has to do with more than just thinking the right things, more than just following a list of rules \u0026ndash; it has to do with a faithful relationship to a PERSON, a relationship which then changes the way you treat PEOPLE.\nConclude and Reflect I write this reflection mid-air, on my way back to Alabama. I wish that I had gotten to see my family members in a house of merrymaking, but it was a house of mourning instead.As we remembered the life of the man who could make you laugh so hard you cried, there was a lot of laughter and a lot of tears in the Steele family this weekend. There was riotous applause at the funeral at one point, but I know there\u0026rsquo;s still a whole lot of sadness and pain.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re reading this and you, like me, are privileged to have known Timothy Steele, would you reflect on the connection between the love this man showed to all and the love of Christ which he had first received? When you seek hope in the midst of your reasonable sorrow, and you spend time dwelling on happy memories of the man, would you consider that the source of all that gracious love wasn\u0026rsquo;t a general sense, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t an impersonal force\u0026hellip;it was my Uncle Tim\u0026rsquo;s encounter and relationship with a person.\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this and your pain feels too great for all this Jesus talk at the moment, if, like me, you experienced a big dose of anger at the side of Tim\u0026rsquo;s casket this weekend\u0026hellip;that God would allow this life to end so soon\u0026hellip;that this world is still broken and infected by Death, would you please join me in clinging to the hope that God hates death even more than we do?\nSometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it, but seriously, he does. For all the hopeful Christian talk at funerals, we can never forget that Death sucks.\nNo, that\u0026rsquo;s not strong enough. Death is fucking horrible. And I hope you agree that I say that out of concern for accuracy, and not merely vulgarity.Death\u0026rsquo;s final defeat has been declared at the empty tomb of Jesus Christ, butdammit, we\u0026rsquo;re still waiting for the final removal of Death\u0026rsquo;s presence from this world. It\u0026rsquo;s not our annoying, normal friend. It\u0026rsquo;s our alien enemy. And I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but when Death strikes close to my door, when it hits the ones I love, I want to rage against it with all I have.\nGod rages against Death. He dove headfirst into the depths of this world, into the realm of the discarded and the used-up, the dead and the dying. He himself dove into the very grave, that he might emerge from it victorious. That he might lay Death itself in its cold grave, that he might silence the bastard enemy of the children of God.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t just follow Jesus to get into heaven someday when I die. I follow him because he hates Death more than I do, because in an important sense he is more heartbroken than I am over the death of my Uncle and the sorrow of the family members he left behind. And because, amazingly enough, he invites me and his people \u0026ndash; he invites YOU \u0026ndash; to join him in the mission of eternal life, to join him in the process of putting Death to death in our daily lives, in the world around us.\nAnd, following the words of my beloved Uncle Tim, that\u0026rsquo;s beautiful.\n(For another reflection on death, hope, and resurrection, read my sermon: \u0026ldquo;Son of Man, Can Your Bones Live?\u0026rdquo;)\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/20150424my-uncle-timothy-steele/","summary":"(This post is about my late uncle, Timothy Steele.

And how should this influence our own repentance?\nThe following series of quotations comes from a lengthy small-print section in CD IV/1, 259-73 (§ 59 The Obedience of the Son of God; 2. The Judge Judged in Our Place). There Barth walks through the three wilderness temptations before masterfully connecting them to Christ\u0026rsquo;s experience in the Garden of Gethsemane.\nOn page 261, the discussion of the temptations begins:\nThe First Temptation: Stones into Bread (CD IV/1, 261-2)\n\u0026ldquo;In both Evangelists [ Matthew and Luke] the first Satanic suggestion is that after the forty days of hunger He should change the stones of the wilderness into bread in the power of His divine Sonship by His Word.\nFor Barth, it is important that Christ is not tempted in the wilderness to any sort of moral violations of the Law. Instead, he is tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For this is the form and content of Jesus\u0026rsquo; sinlessness \u0026ndash; not a vague moral perfection, but specifically his obedience and repentance.\n\u0026ldquo;What would it have meant if Jesus had yielded? He would have used the power of God which He undoubtedly had like a technical instrument placed at His disposal to save and maintain His own life. He would then have stepped out of the series of sinners in which He placed Himself in His baptism in Jordan. Of His own will He would have abandoned the role of the One who fasts and repents for sinners. He would have broken off His fasting and repentance in the fulness of divine power and with the help of God, but without consulting the will and commandment of God, because in the last resort His primary will was to live. He would have refused to give Himself unreservedly to be the one great sinner who allows that God is in the right, to set His hopes for the redemption and maintenance of His life only on the Word of God, in the establishment of which He was engaged in this self-offering. He would have refused to be willing to live only by this Word and promise of God, and therefore to continue to hunger.\nFrom a \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo; standpoint, however, choosing self-preservation over starvation makes perfect sense!\n\u0026ldquo;In so doing He would, of course, only have done what in His place and with His powers all other men would certainly have done. From the standpoint of all other men He would only have acted reasonably and rightly. \u0026ldquo;Rabbi, eat\u0026rdquo; is what His disciples later said to Him (Jn. 431) quite reasonably and in all innocence. But then He would not have made it His meat \u0026ldquo;to do the will of him that sent him, and tofinish his work\u0026rdquo; (Jn. 434).\nHowever, Christ the God-Human is more human and less sinful than us in his refusal to abandon obedience and repentance. For this reason, his repentance was perfect \u0026ndash; a repentance unto redemption.\n\u0026ldquo;Instead of acting for all other men and in their place, He would have left them in the lurch at the very moment when He had made their cause His own. Jesus withstood this temptation. He persisted in obedience, in penitence, in fasting. He hungered in confidence in the promise of manna with which the same God had once fed the fathers in the wilderness after He had allowed them to hunger (Deut. 83). He willed to live only by that which the Word of God creates, and therefore as one of the sinners who have no hope apart from God, as the Head and King of this people. His decision was, therefore, a different one from that which all other men would have taken in His place, and in that way it was the righteousness which He achieved in their stead.\u0026rdquo;\nStay tuned for Karl Barth\u0026rsquo;s exegesis of the second temptation, for Christ to fall down and worship Satan.\nPosted via blogwith\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread/","summary":"Karl Barth\u0026rsquo;s exegesis of Christ\u0026rsquo;s wilderness temptations isperenniallyinspiring, but particularly poignant during this season of Lent.\nWhat does it mean for Christ to be the Perfect Penitent?

Here\u0026rsquo;s the thesis:\n\u0026ldquo;This essay endeavors to demonstrate the theological and exegetical legitimacy of viewing the atonement as the act in which the one God fulfills his creative purposes by bringing his uniqueness and simplicity to bear on our sinful, divisive condition through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah in order to save a people to robust unity with himself, each other, and the entire creation.\u0026rdquo;\nThat paper was a blast to write, because I got to take the doctoral work of my professor (and friend) Adam J. Johnson ( God\u0026rsquo;s Being in Reconciliation: The Theological Basis of the Unity and Diversity of the Atonement in the Theology of Karl Barth, now available in paperback!) and \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo; an atonement theory based upon the divine perfection of oneness/unity. I hope to expand on that work, drawing upon other theologians than Johnson and Barth, expanding my exegetical arguments for the atonement theory\u0026rsquo;s legitimacy, considering practical implications for ecumenical efforts, etc.\nThis year, I have submitted a slightly edited version of my final paper fora seminar on the Theology of Karl Barth taught by Piotr Malysz last Fall at Beeson. The Barthian analogy is taking Barth\u0026rsquo;s definition of sin as ontological impossibility \u0026ndash; the impossible possibility \u0026ndash; and transferring it to thought and speech about the Church. It\u0026rsquo;s a relatively simple idea, with profound ramifications (in my humble opinion) for ecumenical efforts. Here\u0026rsquo;s the abstract:\n\u0026ldquo;Just as sin is ontological impossibility, disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. The tension between the undeniable reality of sin and Karl Barth’s theological definition of sin as an impossible possibility parallels the tension between the obvious reality of a fractured church and the theological definition of the church as the one body of the one Christ. In order to describe in Barthian terms what it means for church disunity to be possible only as sin is possible, the purpose of this paper is to correlate Barth’s anthropological concept of sin as ontological impossibility with its parallel ecclesiological concept: disunity as ecclesiological impossibility. I then conclude by locating this discussion within Barth’s own ecumenical vision – with an eye toward informing and motivating further ecumenical efforts.\u0026rdquo;\nI believe this is an important topic to discuss because, as I put it, \u0026quot; each community’s self-examination and pursuit of Christ’s unifying summons will only be as rigorous as its understanding of the absurdity of church fragmentation.\u0026quot; That is, we\u0026rsquo;re only going to put effort into being unified as Christ\u0026rsquo;s Church if we have a robust understanding of just how ABSURD division is within the Body of Christ!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this topic, but you can\u0026rsquo;t make it to Lithonia, GA on March 27-28, feel free to read my paper here:\nPosted via blogwith\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/presenting-on-barth-at-2015-southeastern-ets/","summary":"I just received the news today that my student paper submission for the 2015 Southeast Regional Meeting of the Evangelical Theological Society has been accepted!\nMy theme lately has been to write on Karl Barth and the unity of the Church.

He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus\u0026rsquo; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.\nChrist\u0026rsquo;s first temptation was to turn stones into bread, thereby using divine power as a \u0026ldquo;technical instrument\u0026rdquo; to save and maintain his own life. Today\u0026rsquo;s temptation contains an incisive critique of Christendom\u0026rsquo;s desire for influence, relevance, and power.\nThe Second Temptation: Christendom\u0026rsquo;s Cost \u0026ndash; Worship Satan (CD IV/1, 262)\n\u0026ldquo;According to Luke, the second Satanic suggestion is that Satan, to whom the world belongs, should give him lordship over it, at the price of His falling down and worshipping him.\n_\n_\nBarth gets right to the point, interpreting this temptation. Notice again the theme of abandoning repentance:\n\u0026ldquo;What would it have meant if Jesus had done this?Obviously He would have shown that He repented having received the baptism of John and that He did not intend to complete the penitence which He had begun. He would have ceased to recognise and confess the sin of the world as sin, to take it upon Himself as such, and in His own person to bring to an issue the conflict with it (as with man\u0026rsquo;s contradiction against God and himself).\nTerrible, right? But consider how pragmatism rears its ugly head!\n\u0026ldquo;He would have won through and been converted to a simpler and more practical and more realistic approach and way. He would have determined to drop the question of the overcoming and removing of evil, to accept the undeniable fact of the overlordship of evil in the world, and to do good, even the best, on this indisputable presupposition, on the ground and in the sphere of this overlordship.\nOK, so even then, the phrase \u0026ldquo;undeniable overlordship of evil\u0026rdquo; sounds quite nasty. But Barth is driving home an incisive critique of Christendom \u0026ndash; the unholy marriage between the Kingdom of God and the kingdoms of humanity and the Devil.\nThe following question is haunting. I am particularly struck by the inclusion of the word \u0026ldquo;ecumenical.\u0026rdquo; If we are not careful, isn\u0026rsquo;t this almost exactly what many Christians desire? How far are we willing to go to obtain influence and power?\n\u0026ldquo;Why not set up a real kingdom of God on earth? an international order modelled on the insights of Christian humanitarianism, in which, of course, a liberal-orthodox, ecumenical, confessional Church might also find an appropriate place?\nAnd we can still fall prey to this temptation, without completely giving up our God! Just worship God and bow the knee, even secretly, to Satan. Sure, you can still be pious. Just achieve your piety\u0026rsquo;s ends through the gears and cogs of the world-machine! You want to be relevant? Hitch your goals to a movement, a political party, a military!\n\u0026ldquo;Note that to do this He was not asked to renounce God or to go over to atheism. He had only to lift His hat to the usurper. He had only to bow the knee discreetly and privately to the devil. He had only to make the quiet but solid and irreversible acknowledgment that in that world of splendour the devil should have the first and final word, that at bottom everything should remain as it had been.\nHowever, Barth\u0026rsquo;s point is that, in doing so, Christ would have completely given up the redemptive mission. We must take heed, especially in our ostensibly \u0026ldquo;Christian\u0026rdquo; nation (according to some in the US, at least), lest we do the same.\n\u0026ldquo;On this condition we can all succeed in the world, and Jesus most of all. In the divine and human kingdom set up on this condition there would have been no place for the cross. Or rather, in this world ostensibly ruled by Jesus but secretly by Satan, the cross would have been harmlessly turned into a fine and profound symbol: an ornament in the official philosophy and outlook; but also an adornment (e.g., an episcopal adornment) in the more usual sense of the word; a suitable recollection of that which Jesus avoided and which is not therefore necessary for anyone else.\nChrist succeeded at this point where every other human would have failed.\n\u0026ldquo;What other man in Jesus\u0026rsquo; place would not have been clever enough to close with this offer? But what He had to do and willed to do in place of all would not then have been done. He would again have left them in the lurch and betrayed them, in spite of all the fine and good things that the world-kingdom of Satan and Jesus might have meant for them.\nAttractive realism vs. repentance and obedience. Will we take Christ\u0026rsquo;s example and Barth\u0026rsquo;s critique to heart, as the Church constantly faces the temptation to give allegiance to the powers, empires, and corporations of this world?\n\u0026ldquo;For of what advantage is even the greatest glory to a world which is still definitively unreconciled with God? Of what gain to man are all the conceivable advantages and advances of such a kingdom? But Jesus resisted this temptation too. He refused to be won over to this attractive realism. As the one great sinner in the name and place of all others, without any prospect of this glory, quite unsuccessfully, indeed with the certainty of failure, He willed to continue worshipping and serving God alone. He willed to persist in repentance and obedience. This was the righteousness which He achieved for us.\u0026rdquo;\nStay tuned for tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s temptation, which Barth considers the most astonishing: \u0026ldquo;to commit an act of supreme, unconditional, blind, absolute, total confidence in God-as was obviously supremely fitting for the Son of God.\u0026rdquo;\nPosted via blogwith\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-2-christendoms-cost-worship-satan/","summary":"Yesterday I posted the beginning of Karl Barth\u0026rsquo;s exegesis of Christ\u0026rsquo;s wilderness temptations.

Instead, he was tempted to abandon his role as the Perfect Penitent. For Barth, if Christ had capitulated to any of the temptations, he would have abandoned God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive mission. Jesus Christ had to persist in penitence in order to be \u0026quot; the Judge Judged in Our Place\u0026quot; (Barth\u0026rsquo;s most concise description of the atonement proper).\nIn response to the first temptation, to turn stones into bread, Christ refused to use divine power as a \u0026ldquo;technical instrument\u0026rdquo; to preserve his own life. In response to the second temptation, to worship Satan in exchange for authority and power, Christ refused to sell redemption short by establishing a Christendom \u0026ldquo;ostensibly ruled by Jesus but secretly by Satan.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich brings us to today\u0026rsquo;s discussion:\n**\n**\nThe Third Temptation: The Leap of False Faith (CD IV/1, 262-4)\nBarth begins by noting the climactic, surprising nature of this third temptation, given the temple setting and Satan\u0026rsquo;s use of Scripture:\n\u0026ldquo;The third temptation, according to Luke\u0026rsquo;s account, is the most astonishing of all. The dignity of the setting, the temple of God in the holy city of Jerusalem, is obviously incomparably greater than the still secular dignity of that high mountain from which Jesus was shown and offered all the kingdoms of the world. It is of a piece that Satan now appears as an obviously pious man who\ncan even quote the Psalms of David, and he gains in the seriousness and weight of his approach. Above all, his suggestion-we can hardly describe it by the horrible word temptation-is quite different from everything that has preceded it.\nThe temptation at hand is different from the preceding one\u0026rsquo;s in terms of its apparent piety! Isn\u0026rsquo;t an act of \u0026ldquo;total confidence in God\u0026rdquo; appropriate for God\u0026rsquo;s Son?\n\u0026ldquo;It now consists in the demand to commit an act of supreme, unconditional, blind, absolute, total confidence in God-as was obviously supremely fitting for the Son of God. We might almost say, an act in the sense of and in line with the answers which Jesus Himself had given to the first two temptations, to live only by the Word of God, to serve and worship Him alone.\nIndeed, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take much imagination to see the connection between Jesus\u0026rsquo; response to the first two temptations and what he is asked to do here. However, Barth points out that this is not designed to be a miraculous demonstration of Jesus\u0026rsquo; Messianic identity. Instead, it something even more nefarious:\n\u0026ldquo;In the last decades we have become accustomed to think of the seeking and attaining of totalitarian dominion as the worst of all evils, as that which is specifically demonic. But if the climax in Luke is right, there is something even worse and just as demonic. It is not just a matter of a miraculous display to reveal the Messiahship of Jesus. It is often interpreted in this way, but by a reading into the text rather than out of it. The text itself makes no mention whatever of spectators. It is rather a question of the testing and proving, of the final assuring of His relationship to God in foro conscientiae, in the solitariness of man with God. Jesus is to risk this headlong plunge with the certainty, and to confirm the certainty, that God and His angels are with Him and will keep Him.\nChrist is asked to affirm, to certify on his own terms, the relationship between him and God. Barth then uses Schlatter to demonstrate the connections between this temptation and some familiar theological concepts:\n\u0026ldquo;Schlatter has rather mischievously said that what we have here is what is so glibly described \u0026ldquo;in contemporary theological literature\u0026rdquo; as the \u0026ldquo;leap\u0026rdquo; of faith. It certainly does seem to be something very like \u0026ldquo;existence in transcendence,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the leap into the unknown,\u0026rdquo; or in Reformation language \u0026ldquo;justification by faith alone,\u0026rdquo; justification in the sense that (in face of death and the last judgment, and in the hope that in trust in God these can be overcome) man presumes to take it into his own hands, to carry it through as the work of his own robust faith, and in that way to have a part in it and to be certain of it; just as Empedocles (we do not know exactly why, but seriously and with courage) finally flung himself into the smoking crater of Etna, which is supposed to have thrown out again only his sandals; just as on this very same rock of the temple, when it was stormed by the Romans in A.D. 70, the last of the high priests put themselves to death with their own hands, possibly in despair, possibly in the hope that there would be a supreme miracle at that last hour.\nSuch faith ceases to be true faith. The grasp for certainty destroys it from the inside out. And yet, because Christ will eventually take something similar to this leap of faith, Barth interprets it further:\n\u0026ldquo;What would it have meant if Jesus had taken this leap?Note the remarkable closeness of the temptation to the way which Jesus did in fact tread. In this respect the Lucan order, in which this is the last and supreme temptation, is most edifying.He will \u0026ldquo;dare the leap into the abyss, the way to the cross, when the will of God leads Him to it\u0026rdquo; (Schlatter).But what would have led Him to it here would have been His own will to make use of God in His own favour. He would haveexperimented with Godfor His own supreme pleasure and satisfactioninstead of taking the purpose of God seriously and subjecting Himself to His good pleasure and command.He would have tried triumphantly to maintain His lightness with God instead of persisting in penitence, instead of allowing God to be in the right against Him. In an act of supremepiety, in the work of a mysticalenthusiasm, He would have betrayed the cause of God by making it His own cause, by using it to fulfill His own self-justification before God.\nNotice the return of penitence as a theme, which is contrasted against a desire to turn faith in on itself, to experiment with God by demanding his acceptance of an apparently robust faith/piety:\n\u0026ldquo;If He had given way to this last and supreme temptation He would have committed the supreme sin of tempting God Himself, i.e., under the appearance of this most robust faith in Him demanding that He should accept this Jesus who believes so robustly instead of sinful man by Him and in His person. He would have demanded that He should be the most false of all false gods, the god of the religious man. And in so doing He would Himself have withdrawn from the society of sinful men as whose Representative and Head He was ordained to live and act. He would have left in the lurch the world unreconciled with God. \u0026ldquo;Farewell, O world, for I am weary of thee.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Look how strong my faith is, God!\u0026rdquo; What religious human being would not have taken this leap of false faith in Christ\u0026rsquo;s place? Barth pulls no punches in unveiling the subtle power-plays against God often at work in the religious enterprise:\n\u0026ldquo;But again we may ask, what other man, all things considered, would not actually have done this in His place? For Adamic man reaches his supreme form in religious self-sacrifice as the most perfect kind of self-glorification, in which Godis in fact most completely impressed into the service of man, in which He is most completely denied under cover of the most complete acknowledgment of God and one\u0026rsquo;s fellows.\nPrecisely in this way, Christ is unique. He is sinless in his repentance and obedience:\n\u0026ldquo;Jesus did not do this. He rejected the supreme ecstasy and satisfaction of religion as the supreme form of sin. And in so doing He remained faithful to the baptism of John. He remained the One in whom God is well-pleased. He remained sinless. He remained in obedience. In our place He achieved the righteousness which had to be achieved in His person for the justification of us all and for the reconciliation of the world with God, the only righteousness that was necessary.\nThis is not the way we usually interpret the righteousness of God at work in the wilderness temptations! And yet, it seems to be the unavoidable conclusion, given that the Son of God had to face these extremely unique temptations to retain his role as the Perfect Penitent on his way to the Cross. Yet even here, we are granted a glimpse of hope, of the resurrection to come:\n\u0026ldquo;We cannot ignore the negative form in which the righteousness of God appears in the event handed down in these passages. This is unavoidable, because we have to do with it in the wilderness, in the kingdom of demons, in the world unreconciled with God, and in conflict with that world. It is unavoidable because what we have here is a prefiguring of the passion. But in the passion, and in this prefiguring of it, the No of God is only the hard shell of the divine Yes, which in both cases is spoken in the righteous act of this one man. That this is the case is revealed at the conclusion of the accounts in Mark and Matthew by the mention of the angels who, when Satan had left Him, came and ministered unto Him. The great and glorious complement to this at the conclusion of the passion is the story of the resurrection.\u0026rdquo;\nPosted via blogwith\nStay tuned for an eventual discussion of Barth\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of the Garden of Gethsemane in light of these wilderness temptations.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-3-the-leap-of-false-faith/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been reproducing Karl Barth\u0026rsquo;s magnificent exegesis of Christ\u0026rsquo;s wilderness temptations in Church Dogmatics IV/1.\nIt is a particularly appropriate discussion for this season of Lent, for Jesus was not tempted to break the Law or commit a moral infraction.

Who am I to have put such trust in myself as to devote myself even remotely to the task of theology?

For death is the destiny of every person, and the living should take this to heart. [1]\nDon DeLillo’s White Noise, “a paradigm of postmodern literature,”[2] yields the kind of cognitive dissonance that makes you wonder whether the author simply missed the mark, or if you are only confused because you suffer from the postmodern condition which DeLillo adroitly analyzes.\nI agree with Pico Iyer when he evaluates DeLillo as “that rarest of birds, a novelist on fire with ideas - and an outlaw epistemologist to boot - he uses his fictional excursions as occasions to think aloud in shadowed sentences, speak in modern tongues, plumb mysteries, fathom depths.”[3]\nOne such depth is the fear of death, echoing throughout the pages of White Noise in the perennial question: who will die first?\nIn this essay, I endeavor to analyze the Baudrillardian concept of hyperreality as it pertains to the human fear of death, using DeLillo’s White Noise and the Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, India as literary and factual signposts.\nWhite Noise Jack Gladney, the novel’s protagonist, is the chairman of the department of Hitler studies at the College-on-the-Hill in a nondescript anytown called Blacksmith. He and his wife, Babette, are the heads of a hodgepodge family filled with an assortment of children from various marriages.\nAfter these core details, however, it gets difficult to summarize the novel’s plot. According to Sol Yurick, this is because, “in a sense, White Noise doesn’t really have a plot: It is about the intrusion of a plot into life, a stringing-together of random events into some kind of meaningful schema.”[4]\nThe first twenty chapters, taking up just over one hundred pages of text, bombard the reader with an assortment of episodes. From the home, to the car, to the supermarket, to the College-on-the-Hill, an assault of misinformation and profundity fades all signals to flat – from the ever-present voice of the television to random interpolations of intense emotion.\nWe are left with white noise.\nAnd yet, plot slowly invades. In Gladney’s own words: “All plots tend to move deathward. This is the nature of plots. Political plots, terrorist plots, lovers’ plots, narrative plots, plots that are part of children’s games. We edge nearer death every time we plot. It is like a contract that all must sign, the plotters as well as those who are the targets of the plot.”[5]\nOut of the static emerges one of the novel’s central themes: the fear of death.\n(Note: I have written elsewhere about death. See \u0026quot; Son of Man, Can Your Bones Live?\u0026quot; and \u0026quot; My Uncle, Timothy Steele.\u0026quot;)\nAccording to Albert Mobilio, White Noise explores “the narcissist’s inevitable trap: a preoccupation with dying.”[6] And DeLillo explores this theme masterfully.\n“Writing of death,” Iyer notes, “Don DeLillo takes one’s breath away.”[7]The question “who will die first?” first appears in chapter four, as Jack wonders to himself whether this “thought itself is part of the nature of physical love, a reverse Darwinism that awards sadness and fear to the survivor.”[8]\nAs the novel progresses, Gladney emerges as a narcissist on a quest for meaning in order to escape death, or rather his fear of it.[9] According to DeLillo, “[Gladney] feels that Hitler is not only bigger than life, as we say of many famous figures, but bigger than death. Our sense of fear - we avoid it because we feel it so deeply, so there is an intense conflict at work. I brought this conflict to the surface in the shape of Jack Gladney.”[10]\nIn Derridean terms, Gladney’s search for center, whether in Babette’s stability, Wilder’s silence, or Hitler studies, is driven by his fear of death.\nThe same chapter closes with Jack’s admission that he is crafting an identity for himself in his Hitler studies endeavors. He wears dark lens glasses and renders his academic self J. A. K. Gladney, via the fabrication of an extra initial. By his own admission, Jack Gladney is “the false character that follows the name around.”[11]\nIn the final chapter of the book’s first section, another confession emerges:\nThe truth is I don’t want to die first. Given a choice between loneliness and death, it would take me a fraction of a second to decide. But I don’t want to be alone either. Everything I say to Babette about holes and gaps is true. Her death would leave me scattered, talking to chairs and pillows. Don’t let us die, I want to cry out to that fifth century sky ablaze with mystery and spiral light. Let us both live forever, in sickness and in health, feebleminded, doddering, toothless, liver-spotted, dim-sighted, hallucinating. Who decides these things? What is out there? Who are you?[12]\nJack Gladney wants to be somebody, and he desperately does not want to die.\nThe second of three sections in White Noise is solely comprised of the twenty-first chapter. At fifty-four pages long, it is roughly the length of the first twelve chapters combined. This is because it is devoted to the “Airborne Toxic Event” (ATE), the novel’s main incident.\nIn brief, a noxious cloud of a chemical known as Nyodene D gets released into the atmosphere, prompting an evacuation of Blacksmith. During the evacuation process, Jack is briefly exposed to the elements (and, presumably, to the Nyodene D) while refueling the family station wagon.\nWhen Jack tries to ascertain if his exposure will cause any health risks, he has a poignant conversation with one of the evacuation officials:\n“That’s quite an important armband you’ve got there. What does SIMUVAC mean? Sounds important.”\n“Short for simulated evacuation. A new state program they’re still battling over funds for.”\n“But this evacuation isn’t simulated. It’s real.”\n“We know that. But we thought we could use it as a model.”\n“A form of practice? Are you saying you saw a chance to use the real event in order to rehearse the simulation?”[13]\nThe answer is yes. Unfortunately for Gladney, though, his exposure to the Nyodene D was (presumably) real enough. As his fear of death increases as a result of this news, even a specific death sentence eludes him.\nJust as science is quickly outpacing humanity’s control (as shown by the ATE and the toxin-eating bacteria used to eat the cloud), Jack’s fear of death outpaces death itself.\nThe final section of the book is devoted to the experimental drug Dylar, which was designed to treat the fear of death. Babette eventually comes clean to Jack and admits that her intense fear of death drove her to have sex with a compromised pharmaceutical agent in order to be admitted to an unofficial Dylar study.\nJack is forced to come to terms with the real Babette, who is considerably less stable than he had previously believed. At first, this seems to bother him even more than the adultery. His center destabilized, his thoughts turn to Dylar, despite Babette’s insistence that the drug does not work.\nThe fear of death has morphed into an intense thanatophobia,[14] even more ubiquitous and intense than first thought.\nAs his efforts to obtain Dylar fail, however, Gladney’s anger at Babette’s adultery slowly grows. He cannot stop thinking about her and the unknown “Mr. Gray” getting intimate in a motel room.\nA watershed moment for Jack comes in his lengthy conversation with Murray in chapter thirty-seven. After discussing the fear of death, hypothetical ways to transcend it (putting faith in technology, studying the afterlife, surviving a horrific accident), and Jack’s actual attempts at finding center in Hitler and even Wilder (the “noble savage” who does not know he’s going to die), the myth of redemptive violence emerges – a dangerous catalyst for Jack’s festering anger and thanatophobia.\nConsider Murray’s words:\nI believe, Jack, there are two kinds of people in the world. Killers and diers. Most of us are diers. We don’t have the disposition, the rage or whatever it takes to be a killer. We let death happen. We lie down and die. But think what it’s like to be a killer. Think how exciting it is, in theory, to kill a person in direct confrontation. If he dies, you cannot. To kill him is to gain life-credit. The more people you kill, the more credit you store up. It explains any number of massacres, wars, executions.[15]\nAlthough Murray claims this is a purely theoretical conversation and Jack feigns incredulity, the idea is too tempting for Gladney to resist.\nThe second-to-last chapter of White Noise recounts Jack’s failed attempt to murder “Mr. Gray,” who turns out to be Willie Mink, a disgraced pharmaceutical agent whose addiction to Dylar has rendered him more or less insane – exposed to the white noise.\nGladney tracks Mink down and shoots him twice in the gut before placing the gun in Mink’s hands in a laughable attempt to make it look like a suicide. However, the dying Mink shoots Jack in the wrist.\nThe myth of redemptive violence instantly fades into a parody of redemptive virtue: Gladney decides to try and save Mink’s life. He takes him to a hospital run by German nuns.\nAt the hospital, Jack’s conversation with one of the nuns brings the chapter to a poignant, jarring close. She explains:\nOur pretense is a dedication. Someone must appear to believe. Our lives are no less serious than if we professed real faith, real belief. As belief shrinks from the world, people find it more necessary than ever that someone believe. Wild-eyed men in caves. Nuns in black. Monks who do not speak. We are left to believe. Fools, children. Those who have abandoned belief must still believe in us. They are sure they are right not to believe but they know belief must not fade completely. Hell is when no one believes. There must always be believers. Fools, idiots, those who hear voices, those who speak in tongues. We are your lunatics. We surrender our lives to make your nonbelief possible. You are sure that you are right but you don’t want everyone to think as you do. There is no truth without fools. We are your fools, your madwomen, rising at dawn to pray, lighting candles, asking statues for good health, long life.[16]\nIn the world of White Noise, even belief is simulated. Gladney returns home, his mind racing, to watch his children sleep. Similarly, the reader (whose mind is presumably racing as well), is left to watch the novel end.\nThe fortieth and final chapter of White Noise is dominated by a strange event in which Wilder – the “noble savage,” not yet aware of his own death – rides his tricycle across the expressway and miraculously survives.\nThe novel then closes in characteristic rapid fire. The Gladneys watch the stunning sunsets over Blacksmith, whose beauty just might be the result of toxins in the atmosphere. Scientists still comb the area, “gathering their terrible data.”[17] Jack is taking no calls. He fears his doctor and the medical technology which are “eager to see how [his] death is progressing.”[18]\nThe final scene is devoted to the supermarket, the transcendental temple of the postmodern age, “where we wait together, regardless of age, our carts stocked with brightly colored goods.”[19] Appropriately, the signals fade to flat as the reader is left with the image of the supermarket tabloid racks – containing “the cults of the famous and the dead.”\nFame and death. Searching for center, gripped by thanatophobia. White noise.\nThe Bhopal Disaster [20] White Noise was first published in January 1985, not long after a disastrous chemical leak in Bhopal, central India.\nOn the evening of December 3, 1984, a storage tank of methyl isocyanate (MIC, used to produce pesticide) ruptured at the Union Carbide plant, releasing toxic fumes which northwestern winds blew into the shantytowns of Bhopal. The white fumes wreaked havoc on the populace, littering the streets with corpses or vomiting, defecating individuals about to die. “As many as 200,000 people ran through the city streets, coughing, screaming and calling out to each other.”[21]\nAdding insult to injury, the factory siren went off at around 2:00am, causing many to think that a fire had started. Hundreds rushed toward the plant in order to help – unknowingly entering the path of the lethal gas. Unlike White Noise, there was no SIMUVAC.\nBhopal was rendered a city of corpses.\nThe unimaginable chaos left rescue workers searching for the dead three days after the incident. Orphans wandered the streets. The death toll rose to over 2,500, with as many as 100,000 permanently-disabled survivors – suffering from “blindness, sterility, kidney and liver infections, tuberculosis and brain damage.”[22] Muslims were placed into hurriedly-dug graves. As many as seventy Hindu funeral pyres lit the night. The district had to ship in more wood just to feed the crematory fires.\nMuch like White Noise, rumors and fear spread quickly in the aftermath of the tragedy.\nAuthorities had to reassure the people that an early-morning fog was not a new leak, that their milk and vegetables had not been contaminated. Furthermore, the real-life Nyodene D, MIC, was every bit as unstable and unknown – no antidote, no treatment. The physical effects of low-level exposure were predicted to fade with time. However, the same could not be said for those who survived heavier exposure. Their suffering would be indefinite.\nBhopal briefly shocked the American public (some of them, anyway) into an uncomfortable awareness of the danger of the ubiquitous chemicals that surrounded them – in factories, on wheels, and in products. Some demanded to know just how dangerous these chemicals were, in the interests of public safety. Others, like the Reagan administration, defended companies’ rights to trade secrets, in the interests of the free market.\nWho will die first? Average Americans, or the denizens of the developing world? Savage nobles, or noble savages? Incidents like the fictional Airborne Toxic Event and the actual Bhopal disaster, along with our reactions to such tragedies, are telling.\nThe former beg us to come to grips with our mortality, with the rate at which technology outpaces our efforts to control it. As Murray put it: “[technology] creates an appetite for immortality on the one hand. It threatens universal extinction on the other. Technology is lust removed from nature.”[23]\nAs Newsweek put it: “Experts elsewhere said that many of the victims in India would not have been alive at all if not for chemicals that increased food supplies, reduced the incidence of malaria and improved sanitation. Judged against such benefits, the risks of chemical accidents seem more acceptable.”[24]\nBLACKSMITH. BHOPAL. BENGAY. BRILLO. Which death should we fear?\nThe Hyperreal Fear of Death in White Noise According to Jean Baudrillard, hyperreality is “ the generation by models of a real without origin or reality.”[25]\nWhen our simulations of reality become indistinguishable from the reality itself, we have entered into the realm of the hyperreal. Not only is it difficult (some would say impossible) to reach beyond the simulations, but we often prefer the simulations to reality itself.\nExamples of this abound throughout White Noise. Consider “the most photographed barn in America,” which has been so thoroughly eclipsed by its own simulacra that it remains impossible to be seen. In Murray’s words: “they are taking pictures of taking pictures.”[26] Mentioned above, Jack’s search for center in Hitler studies and the SIMUVAC procedure are further significant examples of the hyperreal in White Noise.\nNot even (the fear of) death escapes the influences of hyperreality. Although at first glance death seems a weighty enough subject to break through the simulacra and connect humanity with reality, under closer examination, death evades our grasp.\nCentral to the complex dynamics of the hyperreal fear of death are the simulacra of death, often weightier than the thing itself. Consider how Gladney’s fear of death is more intense than death itself. It is the nebulous ambiguity of his Nyodene D death sentence which threatens to undo him, much more than the chemical itself.\nIn a vicious cycle, the various fear-driven ways in which we react to death make our fear of death that much more complicated. That is, it can get quite confusing to discern whether or not we are afraid of actual death, or merely our various representations of it.\nAfter all, death itself can only be experienced once.[27] Until the end, we spend a lifetime fearing that which we have not experienced.\nThe first strategy is avoidance, distancing ourselves from the terrifying and uncomfortable. Consider the euphemism. People do not just “die,” they “pass away,” “move on,” “kick the bucket,” “hang up their tennis shoes” (Spanish), and “fall asleep” (Koine Greek).\nThe second strategy is embrace, subversively trying to strip death of its fear by exploring the macabre. Consider horror movies. Sure, they rely on the fear of death, but they also attempt to treat it – giving the audience the strength to say “I’ve seen worse” when it comes to their own (probably) mediocre deaths. These first two approaches are often combined. The hero attempts to transcend death through valor, to embrace death through battle-hardened courage. Jack Gladney attempts to avoid and embrace death through Hitler, who was “larger than death.”[28]\nA third strategy is examination. This is best illustrated within White Noise by Murray, whose quote to Jack during the ATE merits quotation at length:\n“This is the nature of modern death,” Murray said. “It has a life independent of us. It is growing in prestige and dimension. It has a sweep it never had before. We study it objectively. We can predict its appearance, trace its path in the body. We can take cross-section pictures of it, tape its tremors and waves. We’ve never been so close to it, so familiar with its habits and attitudes. We know it intimately. But it continues to grow, to acquire breadth and scope, new outlets, new passages and means. The more we learn, the more it grows. Is this some law of physics? Every advance in knowledge and technique is matched by a new kind of death, a new strain. Death adapts, like a viral agent.”[29]\nIf we embrace death to strip it of fear, we examine death and attempt to fight it in order to strip it of mystery. However, this is an unsuccessful endeavor. Death eludes our grasp and overpowers our assaults.\nOn a personal note, this was poignantly illustrated by my wife – a nursing student. A baby boy was transferred into the hospital, severely wounded by what appeared to be abuse –broken bones, cigarette burns and bruises, ostentatiously and haphazardly concealed with makeup.\nAlthough the doctors had managed to restart his heart and place him on life support, the first brain scan revealed no activity. During the mandatory twelve-hour wait until the second test, my wife took care of the boy. After the second scan revealed no activity, he was taken off life support and allowed to die.\nHowever, as my wife tearfully recounted the story to me that night, she wondered when the boy had actually died. Had she, in any meaningful sense, been taking care of a living patient simply because his heart was beating? Or was he dead the entire time? When do we die? When our heart stops beating? Our lungs stop breathing? Or when our brains stop making waves?\nMore importantly, whose death do we fear? It is my contention that we cannot really fear our own deaths. Like Jack Gladney, we are limited to fearing and interacting with death’s simulacra.\nWe might long to die like Leonidas in The 300, but not like a contestant in the “games” of SAW.\nIf we have not yet experienced the death of a close family member, we might imagine the event through the lens of Marshall’s father dying in How I Met Your Mother.\nEven when we have had a family member, or even a patient die, we never fully experience death without dying ourselves.\nWe are surrounded by death, in Dylar ingredient lists and Union Carbide storage tanks, in the skies above Blacksmith and the alleys of Bhopal.\nAnd yet we are insulated from it by euphemism and fiction, by news anchor and liquid-crystal display – by the idiosyncrasies of our continuously temporal existence.\nWe are familiar with death, but we know it not.\n====================\nWORKS CONSULTED\nBaudrillard, Jean. “The Precession of Simulacra.” In A Postmodern Reader, edited by Joseph Natoli and Linda Hutcheon, 342-353.

My previous thoughts on these matters still stand.\n======\n\u0026ldquo;Dear friends,\n\u0026ldquo;Every. Single. Week. I am contacted by people who attend and work at CU who are just miserable. I pray about what to say and what not to say; my motives aren\u0026rsquo;t malicious. This morning I was reading about Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and how he couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that the Christians in Germany remained silent about Hitler or actively conspired with Hitler to get rid of the Jews. This situation at CU is no Germany. But faculty and staff at the school I loved are now forced into silence. They\u0026rsquo;re being oppressed. If they speak, they\u0026rsquo;ll lose their jobs. Their FB accounts and e-mails are monitored. A coup occurred at CU as it did at Southern Seminary, Southwestern Seminary, and Southeastern Seminary at the hands of Paige Patterson. Paige Patterson is now a trustee and mentor to the new president, Dr. White. Many who made decisions who fought to keep us and our friends (Bible profs/Carl Ruby and others) at the school told us that it was a coup. So the current administration doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about what fac/staff think. And students are there temporarily so….The chair of the board has said that he is willing to take the school down to 1200 to get their way. Shawn and I can afford to speak up because we didn\u0026rsquo;t sign a non-disclosure agreement. We are thriving and not bitter. But, I do get angry about how people are being treated. Thank God Shawn got a job right away and didn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about providing for his family. Every single person who knows me will tell you I deliberate about my words. I am tired of the pain people are going through. And so I speak up because I can. I think this is the last chance for those currently there to give an outcry. Otherwise it\u0026rsquo;s over for them. They have moved to forbid egalitarians from teaching there, too. Next year, if you cannot say you are comp, you cannot work there. Only money and power can accomplish such a coup. I have no money or power. But, I have the freedom to speak up. So this below is just more evidence of what is going on. Students pray for your professors and staff. Many are suffering and can\u0026rsquo;t even tell you. Many of their jobs are on the line. They continue to clean house while silencing people. Pay attention to who is no longer there and from where they hire their new faculty. I\u0026rsquo;ve lost count of who is gone. People have to decide whether or not they\u0026rsquo;ll feed their families or speak up. So please, speak up on their behalf!\n\u0026ldquo;Take a look at the fall course schedule. The new female Bible prof\u0026rsquo;s classes are limited to female students only: http://www.cedarville.edu/courses/schedule/2014fa_bi_beth.htm.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the abstract:\nThis essay endeavors to demonstrate the theological and exegetical legitimacy of viewing the atonement as the act in which the one God fulfills his creative purposes by bringing his uniqueness and simplicity to bear on our sinful, divisive condition through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah in order to save a people to robust unity with himself, each other, and the entire creation. Given Adam Johnson’s thesis regarding God’s triune being-in-act, the fullness of the divine perfections, and the unity and diversity of Christ’s saving work, I draw upon the theology of Karl Barth and pertinent biblical data to frame a theory of the atonement based on the unity of God. Although the lack of ecclesiological unity is the impetus for my study, I choose primarily to emphasize the synthesis of God’s unity and the doctrine of reconciliation. That is, I focus on the theological explanations within the atonement of why the church is to be unified. However, after framing a unity-based theory of the atonement, I conclude this study by casting a vision for the ecclesiological implications of such a theory.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t make it to my presentation, but you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the topic, check out my previous series of posts and the undergraduate thesis paper from which this conference paper is drawn.

It\u0026rsquo;s much cheaper than the previous hardcover edition, and without his fresh insights into the doctrine of the atonement and Barthian theology, my paper would not have been possible.\nFinally, please attend the entire conference at Beeson if possible!

[1]Comprehension of the passage’s contemporaneous Greco-Roman epistolary landscape facilitates a knowledgeable analysis of its constituent parts. [2] Subsequently, the interpretive insights yielded by this examination facilitate an application of the letter to the contemporary Christian church.\nGreco-Roman Letters Originally referring to “an oral communication sent by messenger,” the Hellenistic ἐπιστολή eventually encompassed a wide variety of documents – from commercial to legal, political to personal. [3] As Greidanus notes, the basic form of a Greco-Roman letter was tripartite, consisting of introduction/opening, body, and conclusion. [4]The first section named the sender and addressee, often including a brief greeting and “a wish for good health.” [5] Most difficult to analyze formally, the body of Hellenistic letters was flexible enough to encompass content suited to each writing’s particular communicative act. [6] Finally, “greetings to persons other than the addressee, a final greeting or prayer sentence, and sometimes a date” comprised a typical conclusion to Greco-Roman epistles. [7]In contrast to literary essays and official documents of the day, written to general audiences apart from any relational context, Paul’s letters are more private and personal – exhibiting his pastoral concern for those to whom he was a representative of Christ and an elder in the faith. [8] Nevertheless, the Pauline epistles arguably exceed their contemporaneous correspondence in length, structure, and didactic intent. [9]Although Paul understandably followed the prevailing Greco-Roman form in his own letters, he nonetheless freely adapted the epistolary conventions of the day to suit his own purposes. For example, as O’Brien notes, although “on occasion the more intimate letters of the Hellenistic period began with a thanksgiving to the gods for personal benefits received,” Paul expanded and developed the introductory thanksgiving/blessing section in his writings more often than any writer of his day, yielding a mix of Hellenistic form with Jewish and Christian content which is present in most of his letters. [10]Similarly, Paul often modified the Greco-Roman form by including a concluding paranetic section of exhortation after the body of his letters. [11]\nAnalysis of Philemon An appreciation of Pauline epistolary form in Greco-Roman context yields important interpretive insights relating to both the parts and whole of the letter to Philemon, in which Paul displays remarkable tact as he advances his request for reconciliation between Philemon and Onesimus. [12]Although lacking a definite section of paranesis, the epistle is composed of\nan opening greeting (Philem 1-3), thanksgiving/prayer (4-7), body (8-22), and closing (23-25). [13] Opening Greeting Of immediate note, Paul atypically refers to himself, in the midst of an otherwise standard greeting, not as an apostle (cf. Gal 1:1) or servant (cf. Rom 1:1; Phil 1:1), but as “a prisoner of Christ Jesus” (Philem 1; NRSV) – perhaps best explained by his desire throughout “to entreat rather than command” (cf. 8-9), but also to stress Onesimus’ usefulness to him in his captivity (cf. 11-13). [14]\nSender (“Paul…and Timothy”; Philem 1a), and addressee (“Philemon…Apphia…Archippus…and the church in your house”; 1b-2) thus identified, Paul’s signature greeting of χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη (3) functions as a benedictional transition to a section of thanksgiving and prayer (4-7), which – as elsewhere in the Pauline corpus – introduces the letter’s main themes. [15]\nThanksgiving/Prayer As Bruce notes, “the ground of the thanksgiving and the substance of the prayer are closely related to the purpose of the letter.” [16] Paul gives thanks to God because of Philemon’s love, faith, and refreshment of “the hearts of the saints” (Philem 5, 7). The content of Paul’s subsequent prayer, then, is that “the sharing of [Philemon’s] faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ” (6; ESV). However, the phrase ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου is better translated as “the mutual belonging which is proper to your faith,” referring to, as Wright puts it, “the mutuality of the Christian life which, springing from common participation in the body of Christ, extends beyond mere common concern into actual exchange” – a mutual belonging which lies at the heart of Paul’s argument and requests throughout the epistle. [17]In addition to introducing the key themes of love/heart (cf. ἀγάπη, 4,7,9; σπλάγχνα, 7,12,20) and mutual participation (cf. κοινωνόν, 17), the thanksgiving/prayer rhetorically establishes mutual goodwill as an exordium in which Paul emphasizes characteristics of Philemon to which he can then appeal. [18]\nBody The main request of the letter’s body – of noteworthy length in its Greco-Roman context – is that Philemon should receive Onesimus just as he would receive Paul (17b). [19]Although Paul makes use of every persuasive tactic at his disposal – including concession of apostolic authority (8; 19b), emotional appeal (9, 12), pun (11), and appeal to honor (14) – the main thrust of the argument depends on the “ mutual belonging” (6) between Philemon and Onesimus now that the latter has become a Christian during Paul’s captivity (10). [20]Regardless of the exact nature of the past estrangement (about which Paul remains virtually silent), Philemon is urged to interpret the seemingly unfortunate state of affairs as an opportunity for eternal reconciliation (15-16), transferring any debts that Onesimus had incurred to Paul’s own account instead (18). In receiving back Onesimus, Paul’s “very heart” (12b), as “a beloved brother” (16), Philemon would continue his refreshment of the saints’ hearts (7) by refreshing Paul’s heart (20). [21]Here, then, is an analogous microcosm of the gospel itself – a fulfillment of Paul’s prayer for κοινωνία (6) and of the cruciform “ministry of reconciliation” of 2 Corinthians 5:16-21 and Colossians 1:24-29. [22]As Wright notes, just as in Christ God reconciles the entire world to himself (2 Cor 5:19), “God is in Paul reconciling Philemon and Onesimus” – who both owed a debt, so to speak, to the apostle for their conversion (Philem 10, 19b). [23]Confident of Philemon’s compliance with his reconciliatory request (21), Paul makes an additional request for lodging based on Paul’s hope for release from imprisonment and subsequent travel to Colossae to be present with his audience (22) – an epistolary structure known as the “apostolic parousia,” revealing Paul’s consideration of his writings as substitutes for his physical presence. [24]\nClosing Finally, Paul reports the greetings of his gospel co-workers to Philemon (23-24), before reverting to the plural to include the other addressees (2) in his concluding benediction. [25]\nApplication If the consensus interpretation that Onesimus is Philemon’s runaway slave is correct, then Deuteronomy 23:15-16 would seem to mandate that Paul not return the fugitive to his estranged master. [26]However, the reality of their mutual belonging in Christ compelled the apostle to facilitate the reconciliation now possible due to the Messiah’s death, burial, and resurrection (cf. 2 Cor 5:16-21). Nevertheless, Lightfoot reveals a potential hurdle for modern readers of this ancient text when he notes that, though “the word ‘emancipation’ seems to be trembling on [Paul’s] lips…he does not once utter it.” [27]The first step in resolving this frustration involves the clear delineation between the context of slavery in which Onesimus lived, the transatlantic slave trade of the 16th through 19th centuries, and the modern day slavery of human trafficking and forced labor – for it is far too easy to conflate the three in indignation at Paul’s failure to request Onesimus’ freedom. [28]Then, once the anachronism of expecting Paul to be a modern abolitionist is noted, it can be clearly seen that, as Bruce observes, though the epistle to Philemon “throws little light on Paul’s attitude to the institution of slavery,” it brings “the institution into an atmosphere where it could only wilt and die.” [29]After all, the same κοινωνία that enabled Philemon and Onesimus to be reconciled could not help but destroy the dynamics of slavery within the kingdom of God and body of Christ – where “there is no longer slave or free,” but all are “one in Christ Jesus” (Gal 3:28).\nAccording to the world, Onesimus belonged to Philemon as a slave. According to Christ, they belonged to one another as brothers.\nAlthough here in Philemon, as elsewhere (cf. Col 3:22-4:1), Paul stops short of prohibiting slavery, it is clear that he understood the gospel of Jesus Christ inescapably to transform the divisive condition of humanity into a restored, eternal unity which transcended all temporal divisions (cf. 1 Cor 7:17-24; Col 3:11). Paul’s tactful requests reveal that the bond between Philemon and Onesimus as brothers in the Lord (Philem 16) **was far stronger than the social expectations of master and slave.**Transcending the issue of slavery – yet simultaneously striking at its very core – Paul’s masterfully crafted epistle to Philemon reminds Christians in every age to apply consistently the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ to their relationships, in spite of individualism’s siren song, which might tempt them to manipulate and dominate instead of to mutually belong to one another in κοινωνία. Furthermore, readers of Paul’s letter to Philemon should follow his peace-making example by seeking to be ministers of reconciliation in their respective contexts – no matter how discordant or seemingly insignificant. This brief letter thus coheres with the biblical theme of unity. Because God is one, his people are called to be one as well – a community of forgiven women and men, Jews and Gentiles, even slaves and masters who forgive each other’s debts and refresh each other’s hearts in the κοινωνία of their faith in Jesus their Messiah. [30]\n[1] Philemon is categorized as a letter of recommendation by D. Aune, The New Testament in Its Literary Environment (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1987) 211-2 and W.W. Klein, C.L. Blomberg and R.L. Hubbard, Jr., Introduction to Biblical Interpretation, Rev. Ed. (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2004) 431. This paper assumes the “consensus view” of the epistle’s provenance: namely, that the apostle Paul is addressing Philemon of Colossae regarding the estranged slave and now convert, Onesimus. The creative reconstruction of J. Knox, in which the extant epistle to Philemon is the “letter from Laodicea” (Col 4:16) which was written by Paul to Archippus (Philem 2), master of Onesimus, is here ignored; cf. J. Knox, Philemon Among the Letters of Paul (New York: Abingdon, 1959). For critical responses to Knox’s claims from the consensus view, see F.F. Bruce, The Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Ephesians, NICNT (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1984) 198-202; G.B.

While a definitive stance is impossible sans a comprehensive study of Hellenistic epistolary literature, it seems best to emphasize the distinctiveness of Pauline thanksgiving and paranesis.\n[12] See A. Patzia, “Philemon,” in Dictionary of Paul and His Letters(ed. G.R. Hawthorne and R.P. Martin; Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1993) 706. As a letter of recommendation, the passages closest extant parallel is perhaps a letter from Pliny the Younger to a certain Sabinianus, requesting that he mercifully receive a penitent freedman. Pliny, Letter, 9.21; cited by Aune, New Testament, 211 and J.B. Lightfoot, St. Paul’s Epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1973) 318-9.\n[13] Pace Doty’s suggestion that Philem 21 contains the formulaic paranesis. For robust examples of Pauline paranesis, see Rom 12:1-15:13; Gal 5:13-6:10; 1 Thess 4:1-12, 5:1-22, the other examples cited by Doty, Letters, 43.\n[14] Lightfoot, Colossians and Philemon, 333; cf. Bruce, Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians, 205; Wright, Colossians and Philemon, 172. Unless otherwise noted, all Scripture quotations come from the New Revised Standard Version [NRSV].\n[15] “Grace and peace” is a modification of the Hellenistic greeting χαίρειν, designed both to affirm the grace and peace of God which his readers already possessed and to pray that they might enjoy/embody such blessings more fully; O’Brien, “Letters,” 551. On the epistolary function of Pauline thanksgivings, see O’Brien, “Benediction,” 70.\n[16] Bruce, Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians, 208.\n[17] Wright, Colossians and Philemon, 175-6; cf. 2 Cor 1:6-7; 4:10-15; Col 1:24; T.G. Gombis , Paul: A Guide for the Perplexed (New York: T\u0026amp;T Clark, 2010) 40; pace suggestions of κοινωνία here as evangelism (so NIV, Philem 6) or vague generosity (so Bruce, Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians, 208-9; and Lightfoot, Colossians and Philemon, 335). The concept of Christian mutual belonging can be seen to have its roots in the “fellow Israelite” laws of the Pentateuch – the example par excellence being Leviticus 19:18’s injunction to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n[18] Aune, New Testament, 211. The theme of mutual belonging is also expressed in the use of fellowship terminology in the epistle’s opening and conclusion: ἀδελφὸς (1), συνεργῷ (1), ἀδελφῇ (2), συστρατιώτῃ (2), συναιχμάλωτός (23), and συνεργοί (24).\n[19] Doty, Letters, 35.\n[20] Although Patzia rightly acknowledges the “continuing questions of interpretation” relating to the location of Paul’s imprisonment (Rome, Ephesus, or Caesarea) and the timing/nature of Onesimus’ conversion, neither issue is central to the discussion at hand of mutual belonging in Christ; Patzia, Philemon,705. Rhetorical arguments noted by Aune, New Testament, 211. As Patzia notes, per rhetorical criticism the epistle can be structured into exordium (4-7), proof (8-16), and peroration (17-22). Patzia, “Philemon,” 704.\n[21] Aune, New Testament, 211-2.\n[22] By “the gospel,” I am primarily referring to the atonement as the act in which God fulfills his creative purposes by bringing his attributes to bear on our sinful condition through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah in order to save a people to robust unity with himself, each other, and the entire creation. See A.J. Johnson, God\u0026rsquo;s Being in Reconciliation: The Theological Basis of the Unity and Diversity of the Atonement in the Theology of Karl Barth. (New York: T\u0026amp;T Clark, 2012).\n[23] Wright, Colossians and Philemon, 181, 186-7; cf. Paul’s use of sonship as a metaphor regarding conversion: 1 Cor 4:14-15; 2 Cor 6:13; Gal 4:19; Phil 2:22.\n[24] Doty, Letters, 36; O’Brien, “Letters,” 552.\n[25] Bruce, Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians, 224-5; Caird, Paul’s Letters from Prison, 223. The list of names at Philem 23-24 mirrors that found at Col 4:10-17, except for the omission of Jesus Justus (Col 4:11). Of note, though impossible to explain fully, is Epaphras’ designation as Paul’s “fellow prisoner” instead of a “fellow worker” as the others. However, Bruce notes that, as “the evangelist of the Lycus valley” in which Colossae was located (cf. Col 1:7; 4:12), Epaphras “would be personally known to Philemon,” and thus merit distinct mention. Bruce , Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians, 213-4. The concluding benediction of Philem 25 closely resembles Gal 6:18 and Phil 4:23.\n[26] Bruce, Caird, Lightfoot, and Wright all adopt the consensus view. Deuteronomy passage cited by Bruce, Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians, 197, fn. 19.\n[27] Lightfoot, Colossians and Philemon, 323.\n[28] Although an analysis of first century slavery far exceeds the scope of this essay, a potential aid in differentiating between ancient and modern slavery when it comes to Philemon is Gombis’ critique of the consensus view’s failure to acknowledge Paul’s language of ἀδελφὸν\u0026hellip;ἐν σαρκὶ at Philem 16. It is likely that Philemon and Onesimus’ relationship was different than that between a normal master and slave. See T.G. Gombis, “Philemon and Onesimus: ‘Brothers in the Flesh’” (paper presented at the International Meeting of the SBL, St. Andrews, Scotland, 11 July, 2013).\n[29] Bruce, Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians, 197-8. Similarly, Wright notes that, although “inveighing against slavery per se [at the time] would have been totally ineffective,” Paul’s subtler message mimics Christ’s approach to cosmic change from the bottom up, from the inside out. Wright, Colossians and Philemon, 168-9.\n[30] Cf.

Bell, Jr. Here\u0026rsquo;s a poignant quote:\n\u0026ldquo;Capitalism distorts the creative power that is human desire by constantly creating new objects/idols for its fascination. It entices desire with an endless array of distractions. The enchantments of capitalist production are distractions precisely because they cannot satisfy our desire. And as far as capitalism is concerned, this is a good thing, for satisfied desire would spell an end to capitalism, which depends on the frenetic power of unquenched desire to drive its productive engines.\n\u0026ldquo;In contrast, Christianity proclaims the good news that we can indeed find rest from the rat race that is the conflict of the capitalist market. Our desire finds its true home, its rest, its delight in communion with God. Desire\u0026rsquo;s true fascination is the radiance of love that is the glorious life of the blessed Trinity. For this reason, humanity might rightly be called homo adorans -- worshiping beings. We are not beings caught in an endless cycle of trucking and bartering ( homo economicus) but beings inclined to worship and enjoy the divine love that provides all we need. In other words, because the Lord is our shepherd, we shall not want (Ps. 23:1). We need not strive endlessly but can be content.\u0026rdquo; (168)\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like braving the crowds, Bell\u0026rsquo;s book is available on Amazon.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/black-friday-book-recommendation-the-economy-of-desire/","summary":"Black Friday proves that the progress of (post)modernity has failed to eradicate the ills of idolatry.

Three persons. The Holy Trinity.The orthodox paradox of this Christian confession confounds many, due to its apparent contradictions, abstractions, and absence from Scripture. From Arius to Augustine and beyond, trinitarian debates have raged even among those who agree that God exists, that the Bible is true, and that it is therefore worthwhile to consider what the Bible says because it reveals the existent God. Although the best discussions of the Trinity begin with an acknowledgment of its inscrutable mystery which eludes the grasp of human reason\u0026rsquo;s highest reach, a sober analysis of the doctrine\u0026rsquo;s canonical presence and historical outworking may help to answer the charges that the Trinity is a nonsensical, unbiblical abstraction worthy of abandonment. Although it is precisely the Trinity\u0026rsquo;s classical formulation that receives the criticisms just noted, it is important to begin at the end, so to speak, by introducing the operative terms before analyzing the scriptural context out of which and the historical context in which these trinitarian terms grew. The definitive statement of trinitarian belief is the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 CE, discussed below. 1 In brief, however, Christians confess belief in one God who eternally and only exists in one divine substance, essence, or ousia, and in three divine subsistences, Persons, or hypostases. 2One in three, three in one: Father, Son, and Spirit – each Person equally and essentially God, and yet each distinct from the other two.\n(For a[n attempted] summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: \u0026quot; Theology in Outline: What do I Believe?\u0026quot;)\nIs the Trinity in the Bible? - Canonical Presence A common objection to the doctrine of the Trinity as just stated is that it nowhere appears within the pages of Scripture. And indeed, despite the favorite trinitarian proof-texts in which Father, Son, and Spirit appear together, “no doctrine of the Trinity in the Nicene sense is present in [even] the New Testament.” 3However, as Jenson persuasively argues, “the doctrine of the Trinity is indeed in Scripture, if one abandons modernity\u0026rsquo;s notion that statement in so many words as formulated is the only way that a doctrine can appear there.” 4 Instead, the narrative of Scripture portrays the Trinity “by telling a history of God with us that displays three enactors of that history, each of which is indeed other than the other two and yet is at the same time the same God as the other two.” 5These three dramatis personae Dei, or “persons of the divine drama,” appear throughout Scripture as God – “as a persona in Israel\u0026rsquo;s story – of which he is simultaneously the author.” 6YHWH – the God of Israel who created the world and delivered through the Exodus – is the Father by virtue of Jesus\u0026rsquo; address of him as such. 7The Son is Jesus of Nazareth by virtue of this same address, but also in light of passages such as Psalm 2, appropriated in Hebrews 1 to identify Jesus as the divine Son. 8Finally, the Spirit appears as a persona of the story, first in the OT as the Spirit of YHWH which gives life and “keeps the creation moving toward its fulfillment,” and then in the NT as the one in relationship between the Father and the Son, who is poured out upon the Church. 9The significance of trinitarian “proof-texts” mentioned above is that they portray the three persons of the divine drama in close proximity. Most significant of these is the baptismal formula of Matthew 28:19, spoken by the Son himself: “\u0026hellip;baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” Although the earliest Christians used poignant trinitarian phrases before the full implications of such had been thoroughly considered, these biblical patterns provided “the raw data from which the more developed descriptions of the Christian doctrine of God [would] come.” 10The classical formulation of the Trinity did not arise from a scriptural vacuum.\nHow did we get the \u0026ldquo;doctrine\u0026rdquo; of the Trinity? - Historical Outworking Neither was the doctrine formed in a historical vacuum. Instead, as Wainwright notes: “the classic creeds were being formulated at the same time as the canon of the Scriptures was being recognized and determined; there was interaction between the two processes, and the Scriptures and the creeds continue to function reciprocally.” 11The ecumenical creeds – such as the Apostles’, Niceno-Constantinopolitan (381), and the Chalcedonian Definitio Fidei(451) – serve as an interpretive key to the complex Scriptures, and yet also distill the divine drama of the Bible into a concise summary. 12A crucial facet of trinitarian doctrine in which this dialectic took place was the distinction between the immanent and the economic Trinity – the former referring to the Trinity within itself, and the latter referring to the Trinity\u0026rsquo;s external relationship to the universe. While the majority of Scripture provides portrayals of the economic Trinity interacting with creation, it also offers enticing glimpses into the immanent relationships between the persons of the divine drama. 13 The doctrine that developed from such glimpses offered a way of distinguishing between how God relates to himself and to everything else, but also concluded that “the immanent Trinity lives no other plot than that displayed in the economic Trinity, that when you are taken into the story told in Scripture, you are taken into God himself.” 14In other words, “there is no deeper reality of God lurking in the background” behind the three Persons of the Godhead. 15Although many of the disagreements took place before the distinction between the economic and immanent Trinity was formalized, the contours of the historical trinitarian debates revolve around where the conceptual boundary lies between the two. 16A concern for the preservation of God’s unity motivated many of the early controversies. For example, Paul of Samosata collapsed the immanent Trinity to the Father alone, pushing the Son and Spirit into the economy, in their respective relations to the human being Jesus and the apostles – the view known as adoptionism. 17 Similarly, Sabellius pushed all three divine Persons into the economy, positing that the immanent Godhead was one God who exists in three modes or roles of being to the external creation – the view known as modalism. 18Finally, it was Arius\u0026rsquo;s commitment to monotheism that led him to shrink the immanent Trinity down to the Father alone – concluding that, because God is the indivisible cause of all that exists, he must have existed prior to the Son, who is “not everlasting or co-everlasting or unbegotten with the Father.” 19Although each of these views would ultimately find condemnation in the creeds of the Church, it was Arius\u0026rsquo;s conception of a created Son that ignited the controversy that led to the Council of Nicaea (325), which refuted Arianism by declaring that the Son is “begotten, not made, being of one substance [ homoousios] with the Father.” 20However, the trinitarian debates continued, in part because of the relative ambiguity of the term homoousios and the ability of different factions to interpret it as they wished. 21 The years between the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople (381) were theologically chaotic as Athanasius of Alexandria and the Cappadocian fathers (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa) fought for the Nicene view of the Trinity against its detractors, Arian and otherwise. 22However, along the lines of Arius\u0026rsquo;s original concerns, if the Son and the Spirit are granted full divinity along with the Father (as they are in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed), why do Christians confess one God and not three? Gregory of Nyssa addressed these concerns first by appealing to the differences between the trinitarian terms ousia (common essence) and hypostasis (distinct personal subsistence). Belonging to the category of collective or common nouns – which unite by referring to the common nature shared by diverse members of the same category – ousia refers to the divine essence or substance, shared equally by the three hypostases of the Godhead so that they are properly homoousioi, or of the same substance, with one another. 23However, belonging to the category of individual or proper nouns – which distinguish by referring to only one member of a particular category – hypostasis refers to the individual identity or subsistence of each divine Person which demarcates it from the other two. 24The divine hypostases are distinguishable in that “the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are one in all things save in the being unbegotten [Father], the being begotten [Son], and the procession [Spirit].” 25The distinction between a common ousia and distinct hypostases, therefore, prevents the collapse of the Trinity, yet through a crucial difference between the distinction-in-unity with regard to humanity and with regard to the divine. After all, it is difficult to ascertain the unifying ousia of humanity because the distinct hypostases both appear and behave in such discordant ways. Due to their myriad differences and a merely conceptual unity, humans are not properly referred to as one human but many. In contrast, the unity of the three divine hypostases is actual, by virtue of the trinitarian rule opera trinitatis ad extra indivisa sunt. 26 As Gregory of Nyssa notes, “every activity which pervades from God to creation and is named according to our manifold design starts off from the Father, proceeds through the Son, and is completed by the Holy Spirit.” 27Christians worship one God, because although each divine Person is God, “by the same proclamation God is one, because neither in regard to nature [or ousia] nor activity is any difference viewed.” 28 Unlike the diverse and discordant human hypostases, the divine persons are completely unified in their will and operations. Therefore, in the words of Gregory of Nazianzus: “the Godhead exists undivided in beings divided.” 29\nConclusion To return to what was mentioned at the outset, the best discussions of the Trinity also end with an acknowledgment of its inherent mystery which eludes the grasp of human reason\u0026rsquo;s highest reach. Theological modesty is always in order, in part because of the unavoidable limitations of finite human speech about anything, much less about the infinite God. Granted, certain ways of framing how God can be one and yet three are better than others, not only based upon their coherence with the traditions of orthodoxy, but also with regard to their impact on other areas of theological concern – such as the atonement and interpersonal relationships. 30And yet, because true theology is not learning how to speak about God in order to master him intellectually, but in order to worship him faithfully, a persistent lacuna in trinitarian understanding is surely acceptable. For, although the gracious condescension of the triune God enables our faith to seek understanding successfully, the inscrutable mysteries of the same triune God ensure that some understandings will ever transcend our faith\u0026rsquo;s reach.\n======== NOTES ========= 1 All dates CE, unless otherwise noted. Wainwright notes that the Niceno-Constantinopolitan creed “has remained the most widely affirmed statement of trinitarian faith in both East and West.” Geoffrey Wainwright, “Trinity” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed.

Substance = essence = ousia. Subsistence = person = hypostasis. Capitalized “Person” will refer to divine, and not human, personality.\n3 Rusch notes that the binitarian NT formulas are: Rom. 8:11; 2 Cor. 4:1; Gal. 1:1; Eph. 1:20; 1 Tim. 1:2; 1 Pet. 1:21; and 2 John 1:13.

Without denying the importance of such passages, Jenson rightly laments those who “scrabble around in the Bible for bits and pieces of language to cobble together into a sort of Trinity-doctrine – usually with intellectually lamentable and indeed sometimes heretical results.” Robert W. Jenson, “The Trinity in the Bible,” CTQ 68 (2004): 196.\n4 Jenson, 197. Emphasis original.\n5 Jenson, 199. The divinity of the Father is perhaps the easiest to note throughout the Bible. On the divinity of the Son, see John 1, 10; Col. 2; Phil. 2; and Heb. 1. On the divinity of the Spirit, see 1 Cor. 2:11; Heb. 3:7-10; and 10:15-17. I have here stuck to the contours of Jenson’s argument in lieu of the common arguments for the divinity of Son and Spirit, e.g.\n6 Jenson, 198-202. The phrase “dramatis personae Dei” is Jenson\u0026rsquo;s adaptation of Tertullian\u0026rsquo;s verbiage.\n7 Cf. John 5:16-23; Jenson, 199. Although this is almost assuredly an oversimplification, cf. Marshall\u0026rsquo;s claim that “the Father is the God of Israel, the Son is the God of Israel, and the Holy Spirit is the God of Israel, yet they are not three Gods of Israel, but one God of Israel.” B. Marshall, “Do Christians Worship the God of Israel” in Knowing the Triune God (ed. J. Buckley and D. Yeago; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001), 258; quoted by Wainwright, 817. However, Jenson\u0026rsquo;s main point still stands, by virtue of Jesus\u0026rsquo; address to the Father establishing both Fatherhood and Sonship within the Trinity.\n8 Cf. Ps. 2:7; Heb. 1:1-14. In addition, Jenson (200-3) focuses on showing the presence of the Trinity in the OT, where it is so often neglected, by positing that the Son shows up via the themes of the angel of the Lord, the name of the Lord, and the glory of the Lord..\n9 Jenson, 199, 204; cf. Gen. 1:2; Ps. 51:11; Isa. 11:2; Ezek. 37:1-14; John 14:15-31; Acts 1:7-8; 2:1-41; Rom. 1:4; 8:11.\n10 Rusch, 2. Gregory of Nazianzus captures the progressive nature of this scriptural trinitarian revelation well: “the old covenant made clear proclamation of the Father, a less definite one of the Son. The new covenant made the Son manifest, and gave us a glimpse of the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s Godhead. At the present time, the Spirit resides amongst us, giving us a clearer manifestation of himself than before.” See Gregory of Nazianzus, Fifth Theological Oration (Oration 31): On the Holy Spirit, 14, in On God and Christ: The Five Theological Orations and Two Letters to Cledonius (Popular Patristics Series 23; trans.

Click the title below for the .pdf version.)\nPsalm 2 - Quare Fremuerunt Gentes? As the first royal psalm of the Psalter, Psalm 2 exhorts rebellious world leaders to serve Yahweh in wisdom by submitting to his anointed Davidic king who has been granted a global kingdom. 1 Comprehension of the psalm\u0026rsquo;s original message first requires an examination of its constituent parts, with an eye toward its poetic features and original context. Furthermore, an understanding of the enduring significance of Psalm 2 necessitates a consideration of its canonical and redemptive-historical context, including the New Testament\u0026rsquo;s typological interpretations of the passage. This essay will provide both aspects before concluding with a brief discussion of how best to interpret and apply Psalm 2 to the contemporary Christian Church.\nOriginal Message Psalm 2 is arranged in four stanzas of three verses each that follow a loosely chiastic movement from the rebellious rulers of nations (2:1-3), to Yahweh (2:4-6), to his anointed king (2:7-9), and back to the rulers (2:10-12). 2 The psalmist opens with a twofold rhetorical question that uses synthetic parallelism to express indignant astonishment at the nations\u0026rsquo; rage (2:1a) and the peoples\u0026rsquo; vain plots (2:1b). 3 The rest of the first stanza clarifies the scene: the “kings” and “rulers” of the earth are rebelliously conspiring “against the Lord and against his Anointed” (2:2), using the metaphor of “bonds” and “cords” in their reported direct speech (2:3) to express comparatively the implied rule of the Israelite king. 4 The second stanza shifts the focus upward from the limited earthly sphere of influence of the rebellious kings to the unlimited heavenly kingdom of Yahweh (2:4), who anthropomorphically responds to their machinations with laughter and derision, “just as humans would mock something ridiculous.” 5 As Ross notes, the two verbs “he will speak” and “[he will] terrify them” (2:5) are respectively a metonymy of cause and of effect to portray the full divine response, arranged in chiastic order (“speak + wrath // anger + terrify”) to emphasize God\u0026rsquo;s wrath. 6 At the heart of the passage\u0026rsquo;s chiastic structure, bridging the second and third stanzas, is a dramatic shift of scene from Yahweh speaking while seated in the heavens (2:4-6) to Mount Zion and the Davidic king\u0026rsquo;s recounting of the divine decree (2:7). Both divine speeches emphasize that the authority of Israel\u0026rsquo;s king proceeds from his divine installation and sonship. 7 As Mays notes, although the human ruler in view is not equal or identical to the deity, this unique appearance in the Psalter of “son” as the Davidic king\u0026rsquo;s title (cf. 2 Sam 7:14) reveals the close correspondence between God and the king. 8 This powerful polemic against the rulers who would dare to rebel against such an authoritative king continues through the third stanza (2:7-9), where the son/king is granted a global kingdom (2:8), described with synonymous parallelism between (1) the “nations” and “ends of the earth” and (2) “your heritage” and “your possession.” The section concludes with a vivid image, utilizing “a rod of iron” as a metaphor for the Davidic king\u0026rsquo;s divinely-granted authority and “like a potter\u0026rsquo;s vessel” as a simile for the relative vulnerability of the rulers of nations sans divine installation and protection. 9 In the final stanza (2:10-12), the psalmist appropriately begins with “now therefore,” a common phrase from Hebrew wisdom literature, before exhorting the rebellious kings and rulers of the earth to “be wise” (2:10) by serving the Lord in reverential fear (2:11) and submitting to his anointed son/king (2:12a). 10 The urgency of the exhortations is “met by the warning that he may be angry” (2:12b-c). 11 The ambiguity of the subject (“he”) of the descriptions of anger in these two clauses serves to illustrate the close link between Yahweh and his king throughout the entire psalm. As Ross rightly notes, the result of either interpretive option would be the same – “the king will put down their rebellion, but it will be God giving him the victory. To rebel against the one is to rebel against both, and to submit to one is to submit to both.” 12 The psalmist concludes by promising blessing to those who take refuge in “him” (2:12d) – an again ambiguous referent, but contextually describing those who demonstrate reverential faith for Yahweh by submitting to his anointed king. 13 Contextually, the parallels between this passage and the promises spoken to David in 2 Samuel 7:8-16 clarify the content by identifying the psalm with the coronation of a Davidic king, in addition to the Davidic covenant\u0026rsquo;s continuity with the other covenant commitments of Yahweh throughout the OT. 14 Despite Gunn\u0026rsquo;s creative proposal that Psalm 2 refers to the anointing and not the coronation of the king, Ross offers a balanced perspective when he views the psalm\u0026rsquo;s original occasion as a time of crisis due to the vulnerability of the nation to foreign attack at the time of a new king\u0026rsquo;s coronation. 15 Within the Psalter itself, Psalm 2 comprises an introduction along with Psalm 1 – focusing “on the victory of the LORD\u0026rsquo;s anointed king over the nations” after Psalm 1\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on the wise way of the righteous. 16 Because the final editing and compilation of the Psalter took place in absence of a Davidic king, this fitting introduction “served as a reminder of God\u0026rsquo;s plan” to its earliest audiences. 17 However, as VanGemeren rightly emphasizes, “the juxtaposition of Psalm 3 [a Davidic lament psalm] with Psalms 1 and 2 creates a sense of dissonance” which refocuses “the hope of the godly from David to the Lord, who has made the promises to David.” 18 That is, the tension between the idealized portraits (of the individual and Davidic king) in the first two Psalms, the “canonical understanding of the failure of David and of the Davidic dynasty,” and the “real world of failure and exile” experienced throughout the rest of the Psalter and Hebrew Bible encourages a christological and eschatological reading – one which looks for the fulfillment of the expectations of Israel and David in a coming anointed king who is both Son of David and Son of God. 19\nEnduring Significance It is reasonable to assume that Psalm 2\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness as the only psalm to use “son” as a title for the Davidic king and the only OT combination of “anointed/messiah,” “king,” and “son” in one passage contributed to its frequent use in the NT. 20 The redemptive-historical context of the second psalm suggests its meaningful relevance (1) during the Hebrew monarchy when a Davidic king was on the throne, (2) during the post-exilic absence of a king, and (3) as the psalm\u0026rsquo;s circle of context extended into the New Testament and the nascent Church – taking on a typological significance in its portrayal of the anointed Davidic king as the type of which Jesus the Messiah was the antitype. 21 Based on the NT evidence, as VanGemeren notes, “from the perspective of typology, Jesus is the fulfillment of the psalm,” because “he is born of David\u0026rsquo;s lineage (Mt 1:1; Lk 2:4, 11), has a right to David\u0026rsquo;s throne (Lk 1:32), is the Son of God in a unique way (Mt 3:17; Lk 9:35; Heb 1:5), and will ultimately subdue all enemies under his feet (1Co 15:25-27; Heb 2:5-8).” 22 Although a full discussion of messianic typological interpretation exceeds the purview of this paper, a discussion of the quotations of Psalm 2 in Acts 4:25-26 and twice in Hebrews (1:5 and 5:5) will suffice to demonstrate the NT sensitivity to the contours of God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive mission and the uniqueness of his Messiah – an awareness which contemporary interpretative methods should embody. 23Following the reprimand and release of Peter and John from the Sanhedrin (Acts 4:1-23), the believers to whom they are reunited quote Psalm 2:1-2 (Acts 4:25-26) as they confess to God (4:24) a poignant interpretation of the resistance the anointed king of Psalm 2 faced from the “Gentiles,” “peoples,” “kings,” and “rulers” (4:25-26) in terms of the lethal opposition Jesus received from “Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel” (4:27). Of note is the intimate awareness of not only the content but also the eschatological bent of Psalm 2 that such a typological interpretation of the text required. In a profound interpretive dialectic, familiarity with the passage\u0026rsquo;s unmet expectations, the patterns of God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive work, and the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus enabled these believers to bring Psalm 2 to bear on the very resistance their messianic interpretations were creating for themselves. 24 Because Psalm 2 teaches that “the declaration of the Son of God is God\u0026rsquo;s answer to the opposition of the world\u0026rsquo;s powers,” the early Christians used the passage to bolster their proclamation of the gospel in the face of external threats, not by directly identifying themselves with Psalm 2\u0026rsquo;s Davidic king, but by taking refuge in him, so to speak, by proclaiming their experience of the passage\u0026rsquo;s unique fulfillment in the person of Jesus and trusting in Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s promised blessing (Ps 2:12). 25The uniqueness of Jesus\u0026rsquo; fulfillment of the second psalm is further accentuated in the quotation of Psalm 2:7 at Hebrews 1:5a and 5:5. The former quotation follows immediately after the introduction to the epistle (1:1-4), and is paired with a quotation of 2 Samuel 7:14 (Heb 1:5b) in order to emphasize the Son\u0026rsquo;s superiority to the angels, a theme which is then carried forward through a litany of OT quotations which collectively emphasize the same point. 26 The latter occurrence of Psalm 2:7 (Heb 5:5) is the first use of an OT passage in the lengthy central discussion of the priesthood of Christ in Hebrews 5:1-10:18, explaining his appointment as high priest in terms of his divine sonship – with an emphasis on the humility of one who “did not exalt himself,” (5:5a) but rather was installed by God. In answer to those who would overlook the Son\u0026rsquo;s unique status, both uses of Psalm 2:7 together emphasize that “the same one who exalted the Son above the angels (Heb. 1:5) has also glorified him to become high priest (5:1-9).” 27 Significantly, the typological use of Psalm 2 in terms of Jesus Christ\u0026rsquo;s fulfillment as antitype coheres with the central point of the passage in its original context: the indissoluble link between Yahweh and his anointed son/king. The interpretation of Psalm 2 in the contemporary Christian context should demonstrate the same sensitivity the NT does to the contours of God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive mission and the uniqueness of his Messiah. This does not denigrate the passage\u0026rsquo;s relevance to Christians today, but rather guards against identifying oneself with the king of Psalm 2 and usurping the uniqueness of God\u0026rsquo;s Son in the desire for authority, blessing, and protection. Although Klein, Blomberg, and Hubbard claim that “royal psalms [such as Psalm 2] relate best to the modern counterparts of Israel’s kings: the leaders of the Christian community,” this approach, seems to risk a gross misinterpretation of the passage if Christian leaders fail to show due concern for the uniqueness of Jesus as the passage\u0026rsquo;s fulfillment. 28 Instead, interpretations of Psalm 2 best emphasize the “crucial inherent differences between monarchs and church leaders” when they cohere with the passage\u0026rsquo;s original exhortation to demonstrate wisdom by submitting to God\u0026rsquo;s authoritative and anointed king. 29 This is a warning to those who rebel against God by neglecting the authority of his anointed king – either by spurning him or, perhaps even more dangerously, by trying to take his place. 30 Christian leaders need to heed this warning just as much as anyone else. And yet Psalm 2 is simultaneously an encouraging comfort to those who follow Jesus the Messiah as the King of Kings, especially in times of fierce opposition when the future of God\u0026rsquo;s mission seems most vulnerable. The promised global kingdom (Ps 2:8-9) will one day be fully given to the Son of David who is the Son of God – and although the rulers of this world will continue to rise up against Yahweh and his king, those who take refuge in the Son (and therefore in Yahweh himself) will still receive the promised blessing (Ps 2:12) as faithful citizens of the Son\u0026rsquo;s kingdom.\n=== NOTES ===\n1 All consulted commentators classify Psalm 2 as a royal psalm, the first example of their remarkable agreement throughout the passage. See P.C. Craigie, Psalms 1-50, WBC (Waco: Word, 1983) 64; D.J. Estes, Handbook on the Wisdom Books and Psalms (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005) 179; J.L. Mays, Psalms, IBC (Louisville: John Knox, 1994) 45; A.P. Ross, A Commentary on the Psalms, Vol. 1:1-41 (Grand Rapids: Kregel, 2011) 199; and W.A. VanGemeren, Psalms, EBC 5, Rev. Ed. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2008) 89. The main, notable exception is a certain facet of Gunn\u0026rsquo;s analysis. See fn. 15 below; cf. G.A. Gunn, \u0026ldquo;Psalm 2 and the Reign of the Messiah,\u0026rdquo; BSac 169 (2012) 431-2.\n2 Craigie, Mays, Ross, and VanGemeren all agree on the verse divisions of the stanzas. Craigie and VanGemeren note the chiastic structure of the Psalm as a whole. See Craigie, Psalms, 64; Mays, Psalms, 45; Ross, Psalms, 200-1; VanGemeren, Psalms, 89.\n3 “Psalmist” will refer to the unknown author of Ps 2 throughout this paper. As Gunn notes, “though the psalm is anonymous, it is accorded Davidic authorship in Acts 4:25. […] Whether the psalm is of Davidic authorship has little bearing on the interpretation of the psalm.” Gunn, \u0026ldquo;Psalm 2,\u0026rdquo; 427.\n4 Unless otherwise noted, all Scripture quotations come from the English Standard Version [ESV].\n5 Ross, Psalms, 205.\n6 Ross, Psalms, 206.\n7 Cf. Craigie, Psalms, 66-7.\n8 Mays, Psalms, 47-8. Ross agrees, noting that “you are my son” is “a pure metaphor. The statement makes a comparison between what a son is to a father and what the king is to God to describe the special relationship between them.” Ross, Psalms, 207.\n9 Cf. Ross, Psalms, 209-10.\n10 VanGemeren, Psalms, 97. For the Wisdom use of “now therefore,” see Prov 5:7; 7:24; 8:32. For kissing as a sign of “homage and submission,” see 1 Sam 10:1; 1 Kgs 19:18; cf. Craigie, Psalms, 68. Finally, for a discussion of the phrase “kiss the Son” as the crux interpretum of the passage at hand, see the discussions in Craigie, Psalms, 64, fn. 12.a; and VanGemeren, Psalms, 97-8, fn. 12. I agree with Ross when he notes that “in addressing leaders of other countries where Aramaic was spoken, using the Aramaic word [for “son”] made sense.” Ross, Psalms, 198-9, fn. 6.\n11 Ross, Psalms, 212; emphasis added.\n12 Ross, Psalms, 213.\n13 Cf. Craigie, Psalms, 68; Ross, Psalms, 213;\n14 Craigie, Psalms, 64. The Davidic covenant of 2 Sam 7 stands in elaborating continuity with the Abrahamic (Gen 12-17) and Mosaic (Exod 19-24) covenants, and is itself intensified and elaborated upon in the “new covenant” of Jer 31. This context of covenantal continuity is extremely important to the interpretation of Ps 2 because, without it, Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s exclusive, close relationship with the king (Ps 2:4-12) is inexplicable.\n15 Ross, Psalms, 200. VanGemeren rightly notes that “any attempt to link the psalm with an actual coronation of a Judean king\u0026hellip;finds little support in the text.” VanGemeren, Psalms, 89. Gunn\u0026rsquo;s proposal, while heeding VanGemeren\u0026rsquo;s caution and offering a creative explanation of the already-not-yet dimensions of Jesus Christ\u0026rsquo;s current kingly reign, seems more driven by the concerns of a presupposed eschatological system than by a straightforward exegesis of the passage at hand. Although the gap between David\u0026rsquo;s anointing as king (1 Sam 16) and his coronation as such (2 Sam 2, 5) is instructive for considerations of the Hebrew monarchy, it does not mean that such a gap was normative for the kingly sons of David for whom the psalm at hand was probably composed. Furthermore, there are other, better ways to explain the unique kingdom reign of Christ during the current age than this kind of artificial reverse interpretation of Psalm 2. See Gunn, “Psalm 2,” 431-2.\n16 Ross, Psalms, 200.\n17 Ross, Psalms, 200.\n18 VanGemeren, Psalms, 90.\n19 VanGemeren, Psalms, 90,8; cf. Pss 19:13; 25:7, 18; 31:10; 32:3-5; 38:3-4, 18; 39:1, 8; 40:12; 41:4; 51:1-2.\n20 Mays notes both aspects of Psalm 2\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness. The OT/NT assumption is my own. Mays, Psalms, 40,7. According to the UBS Greek New Testament, 4th Rev. Ed. (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2001) 887,95, Psalm 2 is quoted in the NT at Acts 4:25-26 (Ps 2:1-2); 13:33; Heb 1:5, and 5:5 (Ps 2:7). Furthermore, there are allusions and verbal parallels to Psalm 2 at Mt 3:17; 17:5; Mk 1:11; 9:7; Lk 3:22; 9:35; Jn 1:49 (Ps 2:7); Heb 1:2 (Ps 2:8); Rev 11:18 (Ps 2:1); and 19:19 (Ps 2:2). Gunn notes that “based on New Testament quotations, allusions, and verbal parallels, Psalm 2 is one of the most frequently referred to of all the psalms.” Gunn, “Psalm 2,” 427.\n21 Ross, Psalms, 213, fn. 31, citing J. Clifford, Psalms 1-72 (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2002) 46.\n22 VanGemeren, Psalms, 91.\n23 As noted above (fn. 20), NT quotations of and allusions to Psalm 2 abound. The three examples have been chosen based on this essay\u0026rsquo;s prompt and the author\u0026rsquo;s prior familiarity with the thought-flow of Hebrews.\n24 As Klein, Blomberg and Hubbard note, “the use of typology rests on the belief that God\u0026rsquo;s ways of acting are consistent throughout history. Thus NT writers may, in places, explain phenomena in the new Messianic era in terms of their OT precursors.” W.W. Klein, C.L. Blomberg and R.L. Hubbard, Jr., Introduction to Biblical Interpretation, Rev. Ed. (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2004) 183. A familiarity with the consistent patterns of God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive work throughout history would have undoubtedly involved an intimate knowledge of the covenantal continuity throughout the OT, reference in fn. 14 above.\n25 Mays, Psalms, 50.\n26 Cf. “angellwn”as a “hook-word” between Heb 1:1-4 and 1:5-14. The other OT passages cited are, in order: Deut 32:43; Pss 104:4; 45:6,7; 102:25-27; and 110:1.\n27 Gunn, “Psalm 2,” 438.\n28 Klein, Blomberg and Hubbard, Introduction to Biblical Interpretation, 358. Christian leaders who desire instruction in the biblical ways of leadership do well to look to Jesus the Messiah as an example of humble servant leadership (cf. Jn 13:12-20), but should not feel the need to identify themselves with the Messiah himself in order to secure the respect and obedience of those under their instruction. No messianic interpretation of Christian leadership is necessary in order to follow Paul when he exhorts his readers to imitate him as he imitates Christ (cf. 1 Cor 11:1).\n29 Klein, Blomberg and Hubbard, Introduction to Biblical Interpretation, 358-9.\n30 Cf.

If you\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of it before, click that link, and then come back here. It will be worth it, I promise!] The written Word of God is, therefore, the authority for followers of the living Word of God precisely because of its providential role in the divine speech-act, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition. 3Practically, this providential role has worked itself out in various ways throughout the history of the Church, perhaps most notably through the development of canon in the patristic era. Theologically, the authority of Scripture is inescapably trinitarian in nature and ecclesiological in implication.\n(For an explanation of the Trinity, see my essay \u0026quot; Trinity: What is it? (Why) Is it important?\u0026quot;)\nWHAT SCRIPTURE IS FOR CHRISTIANS For Christians, Scripture is the indispensable lens through which, with the Spirit\u0026rsquo;s illumination, we view Christ, who is himself the fullest lens through which we view the Godhead. That is, the Bible is a vital link in the revelatory chain which includes Father, Son, Holy Spirit, and humanity. However, the Bible\u0026rsquo;s role in and for the Church is inescapably intertwined with (1) how the Bible came to be and (2) how it is properly to be accessed and interpreted.\nHow the Bible Came to Be Although the story of how the table of contents at the beginning of each Christian Bible came into existence is an old one, questions of canon in this sense did not arise immediately after Christ\u0026rsquo;s resurrection and ascension. 4The earliest Christians, persuaded that Jesus of Nazareth was the foretold Messiah of Israel, eagerly adopted the Hebrew Scriptures, or Tanakh, as their own Scripture. Apart from the Bible’s narrative of YHWH\u0026rsquo;s redemptive mission with his covenant people, the Christ-event (life, death, and resurrection) made little sense. In the other direction, however, the early Church believed that, as the fulfillment of the Tanakh, Christ himself was its true message. Put differently, the Hebrew Scriptures and the Son of God were considered reciprocally-interpretive, and this relationship was the first sense in which canon was considered as “the rule of truth”: the Christ-event and the Scriptures illuminate each other. 5The link between this earliest consideration of canon and the table-of-contents approach begins with the role proclamation and confession of the Son of God as the Bible’s true meaning – of the Gospel of Christ according to the Scriptures – have in creating the Church proper (cf. 1 Cor. 15:1-9). 6Because Christians are primarily interested in bringing people to faith in the faithful God through Christ, the proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Word of God constitutes the Church as the divinely-ordained way in which faith is brought about (cf. Rom. 10:17). To use a spatial metaphor, this ecclesial “point” of proclamation becomes a “line” throughout history by tradition as “the act of passing down” and “the content of what is passed down.” 7The Church is thus formed by proclamation/confession of Jesus the Messiah according to the Scriptures, and preserved by tradition.In the second century C.E., Irenaeus of Lyons relied upon the connection between Scripture and apostolic tradition to refute Gnostic heresies which threatened to destabilize the Christian community by, among other things, insisting that Scripture could not be read at face value. 8This connection was so strong that he referred to the “traditioned” teachings of the apostles as in scripturis, responding to those who accused these apostolic “Writings” of novel fiction by delineating the unity of Christian doctrine which had been passed down from the apostles (eyewitnesses of the Christ-event) to the Church through a clear line of bishops. 9It was of crucial importance to Irenaeus that Christian doctrine was (1) unified and (2) in direct continuity with the apostles\u0026rsquo; teaching (and therefore with the proclamation of Christ and the Christologically-fulfilled expectations of the Hebrew Scriptures). 10Thus the Gnostic controversies of the second century led to canonization in its second sense: the Church\u0026rsquo;s recognition/acknowledgment of writings which already had authority due to their coherence with the complex dialectic between Scripture, the Christ-event, the apostles, proclamation, and tradition. 11Canon\u0026rsquo;s final sense, as a list of included and excluded books which comprise the Bible, came into being in the fourth century. The Church\u0026rsquo;s recognition of already authoritative writings culminated in C.E. 367 with the Thirty-Ninth Festal Epistle of Athanasius - the first canon list to include “all, and nothing but, all [sic] the books of our New Testament.” 12\nScripture\u0026rsquo;s Proper Interpretation and Role In interacting with the Word of God, it is imperative that the people of God resist the impulse to jump behind the text – either to a Gnostic-inspired and disembodied spiritual narrative, or to historical criticism\u0026rsquo;s rationalistic insistence on verifiable facts.Properly handled, the Bible results in the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in order to produce faith in the faithful God.Arguably, the best interpretive method accounts for both Christ as the fullest truth of Scripture and the varied ways in which the Bible has been used by God through his Spirit to accomplish his redemptive mission in manifold ways.That is, in terms of my thesis above, the best biblical hermeneutic accounts for both the central locution (Christ) and the varied perlocutionary effects accomplished in/through the Church by the Spirit throughout history.It does not leave Christ behind in its insistence on esoteric behind-the-text matters, nor does it refuse the Spirit its right to bring the written Word to bear on the interpreter\u0026rsquo;s present context in fresh ways. In this way, interpretation of the Bible leads to faith through the faithful proclamation of the Christ-event according to the Scriptures.\nSCRIPTURE\u0026rsquo;S OWN AUTHORITY As mentioned above, Scripture\u0026rsquo;s authority comes from its providential role in the speech-act of God, of which it is a necessary – yet not a sufficient – condition.That is, although the illocutionary acts of the Bible are an indispensable link in the revelatory chain, they do not comprise the entire chain. Any discussion of Scripture\u0026rsquo;s authority must, therefore, take place with its discursive context in mind, by including a discussion of the Christological locution and Spirit-empowered, ecclesiological perlocutionary effects of the divine speech-act.Christologically, the illocutionary acts of the written Word of God bear witness to Christ the living Word as their central meaning: the ultimate locution of God. Jesus himself never shied away from claiming that he was the fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures (Matt. 5:17; Lk. 24:25-27, 44). Indeed, he chastised the Jewish leaders for thoroughly studying the Scriptures, yet failing to see that the Tanakh bore witness to him (John 5:39-40)! Likewise, in Acts, Peter (3:11-26), Stephen (7:1-53), and Paul (13:16-41) all portray Christ as the fulfillment of YHWH\u0026rsquo;s previous interactions with Israel in the Tanakh. The written Word of God is authoritative in that it bears witness to the Living Word as the zenith of God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive revelation – the “image of the invisible God” in whom “the fulness of God was pleased to dwell” (Col. 1:15, 19, ESV).When the Bible speaks of its own authority, it never does so apart from the life of the faithful, the Church. The two favorite passages for the inspiration (and often, the inerrancy) of Scripture both refuse to reduce the Bible to a set of propositions to be debated within a correspondence theory of truth. The Scriptures were “breathed out by God,” not to be profitable for scientific analysis, but for “reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16, ESV). Furthermore, “men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit,” (2 Pet. 1:21, ESV) for the sake of the people of God, that they might know Christ (2 Pet. 1:12-21). Arguably, then, the ties between inspiration and sanctification are stronger than those between inspiration and certain common notions of inerrancy.At this intersection between the inspired illocutionary acts of Scripture and their perlocutionary effects lies the Spirit of God, who empowers the “inscripturate” Word to become “incardiate,” or “taken to heart” by God\u0026rsquo;s people. 13Pneumatologically, then, the Bible is able both to be and become the Word of God, as its written words are used in various ways by the Spirit throughout the ages to effect God\u0026rsquo;s mission of redemption in and through his people. 14The christological, ecclesiological, and pneumatological elements of the divine speech-act thus enable the written Word continually to be an indispensable part of divine discourse, instead of a merely static word. 15\nCONCLUSION Throughout the ages, God has used his Word – living and written – to do everything from creating the world, to redeeming it; from calling a people, to establishing orthodoxy and orthopraxy in his Church; from inspiring reformation, to drawing people from every tribe, tongue, and nation to himself. In order best to appropriate the written Word of God and submit to its continuing authority in their lives, the people of God should focus on proclaiming its central message as the Gospel of Jesus Christ and allowing the Holy Spirit to accomplish fresh perlocutionary effects in and through them as God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive mission moves toward its consummation – when the written Word of God will be in their hearts and the living Word of God in front of their faces, forever (Jer. 31:33-34; Rev. 21-22).\n(For an attempted summary of the Christian faith, see my essay: \u0026quot; Theology in Outline: What do I believe?\u0026quot;)\nNOTES 1 Unless otherwise noted, I use the terms “Son of God,” “Jesus,” “Christ/Messiah,” and permutations thereof interchangeably. The same applies to “Scripture” and “Bible.”\n2 I here adopt J.L. Austin\u0026rsquo;s speech-act theory, as put forth in How to Do Things with Words (2nd ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975). Briggs offers the following helpful summary: “Austin sought to distinguish between the act performed in saying something and the act performed by saying something, labeling these \u0026lsquo;illocutionary\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;perlocutionary\u0026rsquo; acts respectively.” See Richard S. Briggs, “Speech-Act Theory” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 763. I am also heavily indebted to Kevin J. Vanhoozer, “Word of God” in Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al.; Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 850-4.\n3 Theologically modifying Austin\u0026rsquo;s framework, the “divine speech-act” consists of God the Father (locutor), God the Son (locution), Scripture (illocutionary act), and God the Spirit (who fulfills the perlocutionary effects).\n4 Piotr J.

She blogs at https://amyechase.wordpress.com/.\nJeremiah 29:11 When I accepted the invitation to speak at my parents’ church, I immediately started thinking about what message I would deliver. I decided to give a message on something that is very important to me after my four years at Cedarville and something I am very passionate about. I hope it will be engaging; I hope it will make you think; and I hope it will bring glory to God. If I can accomplish those three things, I will be satisfied.\nThe Scripture I chose is Jeremiah 29:11 and I’m guessing that most Christians could recite the verse from memory. If not, once you read it, you’ll probably remember or recognize it.\n“’For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.’”\nThis is a familiar verse for a lot of Christians. My question today is whether it should be.\nThis might seem like a strange question, but I think you’ll understand what I mean soon.\nSo why is this verse so familiar to us? Well, it’s used a lot. Are you nervous about future uncertainties? Jeremiah 29:11. Are you starting a new job? Jeremiah 29:11. Graduating from high school or college? Jeremiah 29:11. That teenage girl had her boyfriend break up with her? Jeremiah 29:11. Car trouble that makes you late to work? Jeremiah 29:11. Lost your lucky pencil? Jeremiah 29:11.\nI hope you’re catching my sarcasm.\nAnd maybe you think I’m exaggerating. But I did a Google search for Jeremiah 29:11 and you can buy folders, clocks, plaques, keychains, mugs, pictures, bumper stickers, aprons, tote bags, iPhone cases, tshirts, pillows, bracelets, and even playing cards that have this verse on them. It might be rivaling the 23rd Psalm after all that. And I know for a fact that it can be found on countless greeting cards whether they be sympathy, graduation, engagement, or congratulatory cards.\nI saw a meme on the internet the other day. It was an image of the Bible, and the text said: “This is not a bag of trail mix. You can’t just pick out the pieces you like and ignore the rest.” I’m afraid that the widespread use of Jeremiah 29:11 demonstrates a bigger problem: we really are guilty of treating the Bible like a bag of trail mix. Jeremiah 29:11 is an M\u0026amp;M that we pull out time and time again while we ignore all the peanuts and raisins and cashews and granola all around it.\nChristians claim to have a high view of Scripture—that is, we say that the Bible is the authoritative, divinely inspired Word of God. We are quick to use it to tell the world what they’re doing wrong whether that be gay marriage or murder or how to raise children. We say that we live by what the Bible says, but I’m afraid that we’re often guilty of not even knowing what the Bible says. For me, the widespread use of Jeremiah 29:11 proves this.\nTo demonstrate, does anyone know what Jeremiah 29:10 says? No, because it’s a peanut. Jeremiah 29:12? Sorry, I don’t like raisins. But I am feeling uncertain about this new job/relationship/house/baby/friend/responsibility/accomplishment/etc., so I like to be told that God has good plans for me. I like to imagine him saying, “I know the plans I have for you…”\nOkay, not to be harsh, but the Bible isn’t supposed to be about us. It’s actually not about us at all and it’s high time we quit acting like it’s a self-help book or a book full of timeless, ready-to-be-applied principles. It takes study—actual study—and hard work to read and understand the Bible and what God is saying to us. And if any book in the world is worthy of our time and energy and study, it’s got to be the Bible. But we so often pretend like it’s not.\nNow, let me stop real quick and make sure you’re not hearing me say something I’m not. I’m not saying that the Bible isn’t applicable to you and your life. It is. But most of the Bible is not written to be timelessly applied to anyone, anywhere. The book of Romans was written to people who lived in Rome during the 1st century, not to people in America in 2013. Genesis was written for the Jewish people wandering in the desert and then entering the Holy Land during the time of Moses and Joshua, not for the people of your church. And Jeremiah, where this particular verse comes from? Well, we’ll get to that in a minute.\nNow there are two doctrines that I want to highlight before I go any farther to make sure I express fully how Scripture should be applied to our lives. One is the doctrine of inspiration and the other is the doctrine of perspicuity.\nInspiration First, the doctrine of inspiration means that the Bible is a divine product: it is inspired by God. God worked through the process of the composition and preservation of the books of the Bible. Therefore, yes, they were kind of written for us, but that’s different than them being written to us. God knew we would be reading Genesis someday, but Moses didn’t. And so the words that Moses wrote, although inspired by God, are not written to believers in the 21st century. When Paul wrote Romans, it never crossed his mind that Amy Chase from Ohio would be reading and studying them in 2013. So even though God inspired Paul to write and to write things that would remain applicable to people in 2013, Paul wasn’t intending to do that.\nPerspicuity The next doctrine is that of the perspicuity of Scripture. Perspicuity is just a fancy word for “ clear.” (Biblical scholars love fancy words for things.) Basically, the biblical text can be clearly understood by the ordinary reader. Someone can pick up the Bible and read it and understand it. It’s not gibberish. Anyone who can read can read the gospel accounts and understand that the story is about Jesus the Messiah, coming to earth, dying on a cross, and rising from the dead.\nSo, yes, you can pick up the Bible and “just read it.” And you do have, as a believer, the Holy Spirit helping you and guiding you. But the Holy Spirit is not, I believe, a big fan of laziness. He’s ready to help and guide you, but there are some things, like the geographic position of Jerusalem or the historical situation that caused Paul to write to the Romans, that he’s not going to be able to inspire in you. Well, he could, but that would be strange. Imagine if you just woke up tomorrow and could draw a detailed map of Israel, having never studied it. It’d be kind of like cheating, especially since that’s an assignment I had to do a lot of studying to be able to do. It’s a little like a parent helping a child with homework. If my mom had done my math homework for me, it wouldn’t have done me any good. But she did help me connect the dots and understand what I was supposed to be doing to get the right answer. The Holy Spirit will help you understand the Bible, but he’s not going to just read it for you and then inspire in your some kind of otherworldly, enlightened understanding. You will have to exert some effort. The knowledge is there for you, but you have to learn it.\nAt Cedarville, I majored in Bible and one of the very first things we were taught to do was to interpret Scripture well and then to be aware of when someone wasn’t. And, at Cedarville, when a chapel speaker or someone else mentions Jeremiah 29:11, all the Bible majors groan. It’s because Jeremiah 29:11 was the go-to verse that professors used to show us how the Bible is mishandled. Like I joked above, we decide that the “ you” in “ I know the plans I have for you” is the person starting the new job or the person who has lost their lucky pencil. Does God have good plans for your life? Yes, absolutely. But this isn’t the verse to prove it. And it certainly isn’t the verse to put on a graduation card. Let me explain why.\n(Editor\u0026rsquo;s note: for more content about the Bible and Scripture, check out Scripture: What The Bible Is and Why It Matters.)\nInductive Bible Study: 7 Steps to Study the Bible But first, let me say a couple things about the process I’ll be using. At Cedarville, everyone takes certain classes and in one such class we were taught Bible study method, in particular, the inductive Bible study. It’s a process by which anyone—and I mean anyone—can come to an educated understanding of what a passage is saying. I can do it, my grandma can do it, pastors can do it, and my 5th grade cousin can do it.\nStep One: Survey Reading and Historical Background. Want to know what Jeremiah 29:11 means? Read Jeremiah. Okay, that’s a really long book. Sorry. Take that up with Jeremiah or God, I guess. Want to understand 1 Corinthians 13, the love chapter? Read 1 Corinthians. Want to understand John 3:16? Read John. Now, I’m not saying to study the whole thing to every minute detail, just read it. You can read it quickly even. Hey, college students know: a lot of assignments that are assigned to be “read” can be “skimmed.” I’m not suggesting we slack when reading the Bible, but you as long as you’re getting an idea of the book and what is being said, then you’re doing fine. Take a couple notes while you read: Who wrote the book? To whom? When? Why? What is the tone? What seems to be the big idea? What is each chapter about?\nStep Two: Unaided Observations. Read the passage you want to study and understand. Take notes. When I did inductive studies for class, I had to do upwards of 10 observations per verse. To start, just aim for 3 or 4 per verse. They can be as simple as “Paul is making a statement here,” or “Jesus gives a command,” or “This verse switches from third person to first person.” They are called unaided because it’s just things you can come up with on your own. Things like repeated words and cause and effect statements are important to point out in your observations.\nStep Three: Interpretive Questions. After you make your observations, you’ll probably have some questions like, “Why did Paul say it that way?” or “What does this word mean?” If they’re questions you can’t answer on your own about your passage, that’s an interpretive question. Moving forward, it will be your goal to find an answer to your interpretive questions. Try to come up with about five, but you can have as many as you want.\nStep Four: Word Studies. All right, this is where it might seem to get complicated, but remember: I said that everyone could do this method. When we read the Bible, what we read is a translation. Although these translations are wonderful gifts for which we should be immensely grateful, they are also, unfortunately, a bit removed from the original. This means that some of the depth or nuance of the original might be lost without additional study.\nYour Bible isn’t wrong, it’s just that the word in the original language might have more meaning than it’s possible for one English word to communicate. The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and the New Testament was originally written in Greek. So with word studies, we take an English word that is crucial in the verse and figure out what Hebrew or Greek word is was translated from.\nStep Five: Commentaries. Say we’re working with John 3:16. What words might be counted as crucial? “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son…” There are lots of possibilities. It’s up to you to decide. Once you do that, there is a plethora of resources to help you see what the original word was and what meanings went along with it, and those resources are as close as your computer. The original word may encompass more or less than the English word. For example, using online resources, we see that the Greek word for “world” in John 3:16 is κοσμος with the meanings “the world, the universe, worldly affairs, the inhabitants of the world.” Sure, it might not be earth-shattering, but it’s an insight into the original language. And sometimes your findings may very well change how you read and understand a verse.\nIt’s just reading what the experts have to say. Commentaries will be the place where you’ll find answers to most of your interpretive questions. There are some very affordable commentaries out there and if you’re really looking to dig into a book of the Bible, buying one of two of them would be a great choice. Otherwise, there are a few online, but not the best ones. Libraries, Christian bookstores, and your church library would be good places to look. Not all commentaries are big, scary, technical books, and there are some that are very helpful and easy to read.\nStep Six: Synthesize. Look at everything you’ve done and figure out what it all means together. We were taught to come up with a “Big Idea” which basically says what the passage is about and what it says about what it is about. And, we stay away from any here and now language (talking about what it means for me and you) and use only then and there language (what it meant back then). So what is John 3:16 about? God sending his Son. What does it say about God sending his Son? That he did it because he loved the world and that believing in the Son is the way to everlasting life.\nStep Seven: Application. All right, until this point, we’ve avoided talking about ourselves. We’ve focused on what the author was saying to his intended audience. And, because of that, we should be able to figure out what the passage meant to the people it was written to originally. Now, to apply it, we need to figure out what we have in common with that original audience. If we are very similar, then we can apply it pretty directly, but if we are not, then the application will take a little more work and probably be a little more abstract.\nNow, let’s go back to my beef with Jeremiah 29:11. Having done an inductive Bible study like I outlined for you, I’d like to explain why this is the verse my professors use to talk about misuse of the Bible. However, you don’t really have to go very far into the process. Let’s read Jeremiah 29:1-14:\n“The prophet Jeremiah sent a letter to the exiles Nebuchadnezzar had carried off from Jerusalem to Babylon. It was addressed to the elders who were left among the exiles, to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the other people who were exiled in Babylon. He sent it after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the palace officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had been exiled from Jerusalem. He sent it with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah. King Zedekiah of Judah had sent these men to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. The letter said:\n‘The Lord God of Israel who rules over all says to all those he sent into exile to Babylon from Jerusalem, “Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what they produce. Marry and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons and allow your daughters get married so that they too can have sons and daughters. Grow in number; do not dwindle away. Work to see that the city where I sent you as exiles enjoys peace and prosperity. Pray to the Lord for it. For as it prospers you will prosper.”\n‘For the Lord God of Israel who rules over all says, “Do not let the prophets or those among you who claim to be able to predict the future by divination deceive you. And do not pay any attention to the dreams that you are encouraging them to dream. They are prophesying lies to you and claiming my authority to do so. But I did not send them. I, the Lord, affirm it!”\n‘For the Lord says, “Only when the seventy years of Babylonian rule are over will I again take up consideration for you. Then I will fulfill my gracious promise to you and restore you to your homeland. For I know what I have planned for you,” says the Lord. “I have plans to prosper you, not to harm you. I have plans to give you a future filled with hope. When you call out to me and come to me in prayer, I will hear your prayers. When you seek me in prayer and worship, you will find me available to you. If you seek me with all your heart and soul, I will make myself available to you,” says the Lord. “Then I will reverse your plight and will regather you from all the nations and all the places where I have exiled you,” says the Lord. “I will bring you back to the place from which I exiled you.”’”\nThese people weren’t graduating from high school or starting a new job. Their country had been violently conquered by an outside force, the Temple destroyed, and they were carried off to a foreign country. They were questioning the faithfulness of God, feeling forsaken. Forsaken by God who had promised them the land they had been taken from, the land they had watched being destroyed. And now Jeremiah writes them a letter telling them that God wants them to know that they’ll be there a while.\nBut, because he loves them, God gives them a glimmer of hope: this is just a pause in the plans. He still plans to do good to them. But this is a punishment for their disobedience and they will pay the full cost. It’s hope in the midst of one of—if not the—darkest times in Israel’s history. So when we put Jeremiah 29:11 on a wedding card… Well, something just seems a little off to me.\nNow, if you are a position where you are suffering, where you are questioning the faithfulness of God, where you are in a situation comparable to the exile of the Jewish people, then this verse can be applied more directly to your life (though we still have to deal with the fact that you are not a member of the Jewish nation).\nBut we really need to stop using it lightly. Because when Jeremiah wrote these words to the Jewish people in Babylon, he was not writing them lightly but probably with tears in his eyes. God did not speak them lightly but rather as the eternal Yahweh who will keep his word even in light of the faithlessness of his people.\nAnd if we are going to be the light of the world, then we need to make sure we are treating the Bible the way it deserves to be treated so that we can truly tell the world what God wants them to hear, and not just read them some verse that we don’t fully understand ourselves. Let’s be wary of treating the Bible like trail mix because the world doesn’t need trail mix, it needs to see the God of the Bible in all his power and love and hope.\nWould you like to learn more about inductive Bible study?

And while I do not wish to disregard the wisdom of a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I would like to take a closer look at anger as discussed in Scripture, and to consider what makes certain instances of anger righteous or unrighteous, legitimate or illegitimate.\nThis is a question that has been on my mind throughout my final year at Cedarville University. After hearing of a few rumblings at the end of my Junior year, I left for the summer and got myself married. When my feet finally touched the ground at the beginning of term, my university felt like a battlefield. I heard that Michael Pahl had been “reviewed” and then fired over the summer months. Others were being reviewed to see if they really did toe the doctrinal line, or if they were guilty of mind crimes against the thought police. And things didn’t get any better from there.\nI saw the havoc that the Cedarville environment was wreaking on my mentors, friends, and their families. My leaders got rid of and harassed beloved members of my community, and then deceptively refused to own up to their nefarious actions.\nI got angry. I spoke up. And I was convinced that my anger was righteous. Others were less convinced.\nSome stayed poignantly and painfully silent throughout the chaos. Others repeatedly gave platitudes that everything was OK, that we were obligated to trust our leaders, that to question their actions was inherently disrespectful. And some from this latter group met my kind of anger with their own frustration and anger that I dared to criticize their beloved Cedarville.\nI’d love to say that I met this opposition with nothing but grace and equanimity, but that wouldn’t be true. I frequently lashed out against these types of people - when they sent me long messages to accuse me of causing unnecessary dissentious strife, or when they parodied us student activists as complete morons with nothing better to do than cook up conspiracy theories.\nMy university’s behavior was sickening, but these people’s behavior was infuriating. I couldn’t comprehend how they could overlook the suffering I was witnessing and try to protect people who were clearly hiding the truth. So, at times, I lashed out in frustration. And I am convinced that my anger was unrighteous. But what’s the difference between these two types of anger?\nBefore considering how we should be rightly angry, I’d like to ask three questions. The first is for our great green theologian:\nYODA, DOES RIGHTEOUS ANGER EXIST? According to Yoda and friends, there is no such thing as legitimate anger, at least not humanly-speaking. After all, doesn’t Proverbs (29:11, NET) say that:\n“A fool lets fly with all his temper,\nbut a wise person keeps it back.”?\nAnd James (1:19-20) says:\n“Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness.”\nOr what about when Paul says (Eph 4:31-32):\n“You must put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling, and slanderous talk—indeed all malice. Instead, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ also forgave you.”\nWhen these verses are combined with our all-too-familiar ways of speaking about “gentle Jesus, meek and mild,” anger ends up getting quite the bad rap! Aren’t Christians supposed to “turn the other cheek” (Matt 5:39)? Aren’t we supposed to keep calm and stay in line - head down, Bible open, mouth shut?\nUpon closer examination, Scripture provides a much more complex view of anger than this.\nFor example, consider Ephesians 4:26-27. Four verses before the command to “put away all bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling … [and] all malice,” Paul tells the Ephesian believers to “Be angry and do not sin.” However, he then continues with the admonition to “not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger” and to “not give the devil an opportunity.”\nAlthough Paul’s seemingly contradictory counsel here is usually used to denounce anger as an appropriate emotion, a closer analysis of these two verses in context appears to give righteous anger a legitimate place when sin infects the Christian community. That is, giving the devil a foothold could refer to either the sin which anger might produce, or to allowing the sin which caused the anger in the first place to fester, but it is not an indictment of the anger itself.\nAnd this is probably for the best, because examples abound of Yahweh, his Son, and his servants getting quite angry!\nConsider Exodus 22:22-24:\n“You must not afflict any widow or orphan. If you afflict them in any way and they cry to me, I will surely hear their cry, and my anger will burn and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives will be widows and your children will be fatherless.\nIn the original Hebrew, this passage is even more intense, along the following lines: “If you afflict them in even the slightest way, and they even think about crying out to me, then I will hearingly hear their cry. My fiery anger will burn, and I will kill you with the sword, so that, in exchange, YOUR wives will be widows and YOUR children will be orphans.” So much for gentle Yahweh, meek and mild!\nIn the New Testament, we see that the Son of God gets angry as well. After all, when he witnesses money-changers making his Father’s holy house into a marketplace, he doesn’t calmly suggest that they leave. Instead, he makes a whip, flips their tables, scatters their coins, and drives them out of the temple! (Jn 2:13-22).\nFurthermore, consider Jesus’ anger at the hypocritical practices of both the scribes and the Pharisees (Matt 23). He calls them children of hell (23:15), blind fools (23:17), whitewashed tombs (23:27), the offspring of vipers (23:33), and descendants of those who murdered the prophets (23:31)!\nAnd speaking of the prophets, as some of Yahweh’s most faithful servants in the midst of faithless generations, they got quite angry themselves! Examples abound, but one of my personal favorites is Amos 7:16-17, the prophet Amos’s response to being told by Amaziah not to preach against Jeroboam and Israel:\nSo now listen to the Lord’s message! You say, ‘Don’t prophesy against Israel! Don’t preach against the family of Isaac!’\n“Therefore this is what the Lord says:\n‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets\nand your sons and daughters will die violently.\nYour land will be given to others\nand you will die in a foreign land.\nIsrael will certainly be carried into exile away from its land.’”\nBased on the behavior of Yahweh, Jesus, and the prophets, it seems that we should reconsider Yoda’s position and at least acknowledge that righteous anger exists. In at least some circumstances, it is possible to be angry and please God.\nOur second question, then, is for the most successful Hebrew prophet, who got angry for all the wrong reasons:\nJONAH, ARE YOU REALLY SO VERY ANGRY? I’m presupposing that you all know the basic story of Jonah. You know, the bit about how he refuses to go to the Assyrian capital (Nineveh), gets himself cast into the sea and swallowed by a huge fish, and eventually goes to preach a one sentence prophetic message that turns out to be remarkably successful - everyone from the Ninevite king to the Ninevite cattle repented in sackcloth!\nHowever, the book of Jonah is a much richer literary work than we often give it credit. As just one example out of many ingenious literary moves in the book, us readers never find out Jonah’s motivation for his disobedience, reluctance, and frustration until the fourth and final chapter. As was read earlier, Nineveh’s repentance and Yahweh’s relent from judgment\u0026hellip;(Jonah 4:1-4)\ndispleased Jonah terribly and he became very angry. He prayed to the Lord and said, “Oh, Lord, this is just what I thought would happen when I was in my own country. This is what I tried to prevent by attempting to escape to Tarshish!—\nWhat Jonah has to say next, however, is even more shocking!\nbecause I knew that you are gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in mercy, and one who relents concerning threatened judgment. So now, Lord, kill me instead, because I would rather die than live!”\nJonah’s not angry because of injustice or even inconvenience\u0026hellip;he’s angry because of God’s mercy or hesed: his gracious, compassionate, relenting, merciful, and steadfast love! But before we consider the heinous nature of such anger, let’s note that this is a theologically astute observation on Jonah’s part. He’s quoting a creed which gets at the heart of who Yahweh is:\nConsider Exodus 34:6\nThe Lord passed by before him and proclaimed: “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, and abounding in loyal love (hesed) and faithfulness,\nNehemiah 9:17\nBut you are a God of forgiveness, merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and unfailing in your loyal love (hesed).\nPsalm 86:15\nBut you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God.\nYou are patient and demonstrate great loyal love (hesed) and faithfulness.\nJoel 2:13\nReturn to the Lord your God,\nfor he is merciful and compassionate,\nslow to anger and boundless in loyal love—often relenting from calamitous punishment.\nYahweh is slow to anger (literally “long of nostrils,” picture the deep sigh you give when someone frustrates you) and abounding in hesed, which predisposes him toward mercy, compassion, and even relenting from judgment, as he had just done with the Ninevites. And THIS is what makes Jonah so upset.\nInstead of being joyful at the broad scope of the Gospel as God’s redemptive mission, at the remarkable success of his brief prophetic endeavor, and at the complete repentance of the Ninevite people, Jonah is furious because God has broken his mold. Yahweh had chosen to relent and to redeem the Ninevite other, and for Jonah, this was simply unacceptable.\nYahweh’s first rhetorical question, “Are you really so very angry?” (4:4) fails to bring Jonah around. And things get even worse. Jonah goes to sit and see what would happen to Nineveh. God sends a qiqayon, a little plant, to provide shade for the ornery prophet, and Jonah was very delighted. However, Yahweh the masterful teacher then sends a worm to devour the plant and a hot east wind to make Jonah faint. True to form, Jonah again cries out in anger: “I would rather die than live!” (4:8).\nYahweh challenges Jonah again: “Are you really (or rightly) so very angry about the little plant?” Jonah replies: “I have good reason to be angry, even to death (NASB or) I am as angry as I could possibly be!” (4:9).\nThen Yahweh brings the lesson home with force: “You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight. 11 Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city (implied: for which I worked and which I caused to grow!) in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals? (4:10-11, NASB)”\nJonah’s anger was unrighteous in that it was a self-centered hindrance to God’s mission. By scorning Yahweh’s mercy and ignoring the broad scope of his redemptive hesed love, Jonah disdained the repentance of the Ninevite other. He got angry for all the wrong reasons. And yet his failures are a powerful indictment against our own. After all, at least 90% of my anger is driven by selfish concerns. It’s not even an “us vs. them” moment most of the time. It’s usually ME vs. everyone else! and I can’t often care any LESS about God’s redemptive mission, as long as the checkout line’s moving too slowly for my liking, as long as the car in front of me just cut me off, as long as there’s someone on the internet with whom I disagree!\nIf it’s so easy to fall into Jonah-like frustration, is there any hope left for righteous anger?\nLet’s ask the prophet who got to preach Jonah’s dream message against Nineveh:\nNAHUM, WHY IS GOD SO ANGRY? In the seventh century BC, Nahum got to preach the prophetic oracles against Nineveh that Jonah had wanted to utter. Apparently, although Nineveh and the Assyrians had been used by God as an instrument of judgment in the eighth century exile, they had grown prideful of their vicious pursuits. Drunk with the blood of their victims, the Assyrians paid no mind to Yahweh who had allowed them to thrive. This brought about a change in the divine approach to the Assyrian empire. We can see this in Nahum’s modification of the traditional credal statement mentioned above. Let’s take another look at Nahum 1:2-3:\nThe Lord is a zealous and avenging God;\nthe Lord is avenging and very angry.\nThe Lord takes vengeance against his foes;\nhe sustains his rage against his enemies.\n3 The Lord is slow to anger but great in power;\nthe Lord will certainly not allow the wicked to go unpunished.\nIf you’ll compare Nahum 1:3 with Jonah 4:2, you’ll see what I mean. Although the traditional form is “Yahweh is slow to anger, but great in hesed,” Nahum switches _hesed_out with power. No longer would the vicious Assyrians experience the merciful and steadfast love of Yahweh. As one commentator puts it, “God’s patience at the time of Jonah one century earlier had run out. Nineveh had exhausted the “great mercy” of God and now would experience the “great power” of God.\u0026quot; The rest of the book of Nahum is a series of oracles describing exactly what this would mean.\nI believe that Nahum’s devastating oracles against Nineveh were important to the Hebrew mindset because they preserved Yahweh’s powerful justice as the counterpoint to the themes of merciful universalism in books like Jonah. Nahum’s relationship to Jonah is a bit like the relationship of Job and Ecclesiastes to Proverbs. The former provide important theological counterpoints to the latter books. In Jonah, Yahweh desires to teach the arrogant Hebrew prophet a lesson about the scope of the divine mission of mercy and redemption. Although it’s understandable why Jonah would have been hesitant to see Nineveh repent and be delivered from judgment (given Assyria’s messy relationship with Israel), Yahweh wanted to show Jonah that NO ONE was outside of his mercy’s reach. In fact, sometimes Ninevites repent better than God’s chosen people!\nBut what about when the Ninevites are consistently guilty of atrocities against God’s people? Sure, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean Israel should go all Jonah on them and discount the possibility of repentance/deliverance ever occurring, but what about on God’s end of the deal? Is he so merciful that he no longer cares about injustice? Is he getting soft? Turning into some passive nice guy who’s only mildly bothered by things like slaughter and oppression?\nBooks like Nahum answer those kind of painful questions cried out by victims of oppression:\nNo. Yahweh is not complacent when it comes to heinous sin. In fact, he hates it more than any human possibly could. This does not negate his mercy - the message of Jonah still stands - but he is not a passive onlooker when it comes to Sin and Death and those who enact them. He is a mighty warrior on a mission of redemption and deliverance, especially when it comes to the powerless and the oppressed. This theme echoes throughout the pages of Scripture, from the Exodus to the Cross to the coming Kingdom. The righteous anger of Yahweh is redemptive, and it usually focuses on the mistreatment of the weak.\nHOW, THEN, SHOULD WE BE ANGRY? If Yoda, Jonah, and Nahum have taught us anything, we should acknowledge that the crucial difference between righteous and unrighteous anger is whether it helps or hinders God’s redemptive mission, the Gospel. It’s important, then, that we sit long with Scripture and the Church in order to better know what the Gospel really is. The more clearly we understand the foundational Gospel principles of things like shalom peace, hesed love, and mishpat justice, the more likely it is that we’ll recognize the appropriate things to get angry about. As we become more familiar with God’s redemptive mission, we should gently remind Yoda and others that there is indeed a place for anger which is pleasing to God.\nFurthermore, we should heed the warnings of Jonah’s failures, lest our anger be just as self-centered and Gospel-opposed as his was. After all, we can ALWAYS stumble down Jonah’s path. When it comes to my anger against my alma mater and my online detractors, as much as I’d like to paint the unjust fundamentalists as the Jonahs of the story… I’m just as much like Jonah when I refuse to believe that God can work through them, when I place them outside of the scope of God’s redemptive mission. We do well to consider continually whether our anger is stubbornly self-centered, and to remind ourselves that Yahweh is (insert deep, calming sigh) slow to anger and abounding in hesed. The people of God should strive to exemplify the same attributes.\nHowever, Nahum reminds us that God will not be mocked. He takes oppressive opposition to his redemptive mission very seriously, and the divine warrior’s wrath is kindled when Sin and Death rear their ugly heads in this world. He rages against the violence, poverty, famine, hunger, disease, disasters, and indifference which kill untold millions of his precious image-bearers each year. His fiery anger burns when baby girls are killed for nothing more than their gender, when people die amid the rubble of poorly-built factories for the sake of corporate greed - the idols of wealth and power, when children have to witness their parents die from HIV/AIDS, not knowing how long they and their siblings have before the disease takes their lives as well. If these things do not anger us, something is wrong.\nBut perhaps the most infuriating thing to Yahweh is when those who have been redeemed in and through his precious Son commit injustices in his holy name! I can only imagine how angry it makes God that his people treat others as inferior beings - be it women, or immigrants, or homosexuals, or other races, or the poor - for the sake of a pretentious and profane pride they DARE to call holiness.\nOr what about the divine heartbreak over the fragmentation of the Church? Can you imagine how much it upsets God when his people split for every little reason, in pursuit of supposed “purity,” ignoring that the goal of his redemptive mission is to reconcile all things to himself, to make us ONE in Christ?\nTo bring this closer to home, can you imagine how much it upsets God that my university, which claims to exist “For the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ,” has repeatedly shown itself willing to mistreat godly people and then to lie about it? That the leaders of Cedarville are willing to buy the silence of the mistreated through non-disclosure agreements? That they are willing to appeal to God’s knowledge by using platitudes like “God is not surprised” to justify their actions against those who have less power? What happened to Michael Pahl and his family, in addition to many others this year within the Cedarville community at the hands of those who claim Christ’s name has been appallingly shameful.\nMy brothers and sisters, we serve a God who is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast, merciful, and compassionate love. Let us not forget these things. May we, as God’s people, always be driven by the logic of his redemptive love.\nBut Yahweh is also immensely powerful and passionate, and often very angry about the effects of Sin and Death around the world and among his people. Therefore, let us not sin in our anger, as we are prone to do, but let us oppose sin in our righteous anger, with our eyes and our hearts turned toward the powerless, oppressed, sick, broken, and dying of this world as we further Yahweh’s redemptive mission and accomplish the righteousness of God.\nAmen.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/unrighteous-anger-yoda-jonah-nahum-and-us/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e(TEXTS: \u003ca href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah%203:5-10;%204:1-11;%20Nahum%201:1-8\u0026amp;version=NET\"\u003eJonah 3:5-10; 4:1-11; Nahum 1:1-8\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eINTRODUCTION\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fear-leaeds-to-anger-yoda-quote-from-star-wars.jpg?w=590\" alt=\"Image\"  /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great green theologian of old claimed that anger is based on fear, that it leads to hatred, and results in suffering.

Go check out the rest of Issue 10!)\n\u0026ldquo;A Farewell to Cedarville\u0026rdquo; - Joshua Steele\nAs what was once a vision for the future has become an agenda for returning to the past, the list of people who no longer fit the Cedarville mold is growing. I contacted former vice president of Student Life, Dr. Carl Ruby; former professor Dr. Michael Pahl; current professors Dr. TC Ham, Dr. Shawn Graves, and Dr. David Mills; and former trustees Dr. William Rudd and Rev. Chris Williamson to see where things stand as this academic year comes to a close.\nAlthough Dr. Ruby does not know what the long term future holds, he is pouring himself into immigration reform. When asked about his plans, he replied: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m motivated by an experience that I had on the Civil Rights bus tour in Birmingham, Alabama. As I read King\u0026rsquo;s Letter from a Birmingham Jail, I determined that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be on the wrong side of history, or more important, on the wrong side of the gospel on these kinds of issues. I leave Cedarville with lots of good memories and a clear conscience. I hope I invested my time and energy in the things that mattered most \u0026hellip; loving God and loving people.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd speaking of immigrants, Dr. Pahl moved his family nearly 2,000 miles as the crow flies from Alberta, Canada to Cedarville, Ohio in 2011. However, after just two semesters, the \u0026ldquo;promising scholar\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;dedicated teacher\u0026rdquo; was fired for his inability \u0026ldquo;to concur fully with each and every position of Cedarville University’s doctrinal statement.\u0026rdquo; The Pahls have spent the year trying to move on – looking for work, and working on renovations to sell the old parsonage which they bought less than three months before receiving notice of Dr. Pahl’s \u0026ldquo;review.\u0026rdquo;\nIt would be one thing if the Pahls were victims of a broken immigration system. It seems, however, that they are victims of a broken institution which claims the name of Christ.\nAlthough Dr. Ruby and Dr. Pahl had little say regarding their terminations, others are voluntarily choosing to disassociate from the University.\nPrompted by the changing Cedarville climate, Dr. Ham will be making the move to Canton, OH this summer to teach at Malone University. \u0026ldquo;I should note that I am not being forced to resign. I am leaving voluntarily,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Ham clarified. \u0026ldquo;However, I would not have been seeking other ministry opportunities had the past two years been different. For me, it was the events surrounding the termination of my good friend Michael Pahl that prompted me to look elsewhere. Other recent events—mostly known to the student body, but some unknown to them—have served to solidify my decision. While I am very excited about my future ministry, it is with profound sadness that I leave the wonderful men and women I’ve known as colleagues here.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter the elimination of the philosophy major, Dr. Graves was offered a terminal contract. However, he has instead accepted a tenure track position at the University of Findlay, where he will begin teaching this fall. His wife, Marlena Graves, will conclude her role as the Resident Director of Murphy Hall at the end of this semester.\nDr. Mills, if he is at Cedarville next year, will have to carry the course load for the remaining philosophy minor in Dr. Graves’ absence. Dr. Mills declined the option to drastically expand the Honors Program during the 2013-14 school year before handing it over to an unknown successor, and was therefore removed from his involvement in the program, effective at the end of this semester.\nThe voluntary disassociations are not limited to faculty and staff, but also include trustees. Recent changes in the Board have included the resignations of Dr. Rudd and Rev. Williamson, two proponents of the same concerns held by student advocates such as myself.\nDr. Rudd, who served as a Cedarville trustee for over 20 years, including multiple terms as Board Chairman, had the following to say regarding his resignation:\n\u0026ldquo;I’m very thankful for CU and the privilege of being very closely associated with it for so many years. I have many dear friends there who are amazing servants of God. It saddens me deeply that I could no longer support actions and direction of the current leadership and that I was no longer able to exert influence for what I believe to be truthfulness, integrity, and Biblical consistency. God has graciously blessed Cedarville and there are many, many wonderful people still associated with it. I pray that the leadership will be restored to Biblical integrity.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Rev. Williamson’s words: \u0026ldquo;The board of trustees repeatedly mishandled God\u0026rsquo;s servants while virtually ignoring the cries of students and alumni alike. Any hint of due process was abandoned, and the ability to have respectful dialogues on key issues was non-existent. I resigned because I could no longer be associated with a group that was constantly untruthful and unjust.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so the Cedarville diaspora grows. If this university is going to inspire true greatness, it should avoid driving away godly individuals like Ruby, Pahl, Ham, Graves, Mills, Williamson, and Rudd in the future.\nSome may accuse me of biting the hand that feeds. But it is not the same hand.\nI have been fed by Carl Ruby’s Cedarville, not the new Cedarville of twenty years ago. As the University hearkens back to the glory days before creeping \u0026ldquo;liberalism\u0026rdquo; reached the bubble’s border, the leadership has responded to repeated requests for clarity and honesty with poignant silences and disappointing distortions of the truth.\nGod is not surprised. I wonder if he is angered, though, by having his knowledge and sovereignty used to justify injustice. Cedarville, fulfill your call and be true to our God – not by claiming institutional prerogatives to drive away our Christlike best – but by doing justice, promoting honesty, and walking humbly with Him whose name we claim. Update: Dr. Carl B. Smith, Professor of Church History, has willfully decided to turn in an unsigned contract. Although he does not have further employment lined up at this time, he will not be returning to Cedarville for the 2013-14 academic year.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/a-farewell-to-cedarville/","summary":"(Originally posted in The Ventriloquist.

Unless its leaders frankly and forthrightly admit their agenda for the future and their recent decisions including the firing of Dr. Carl Ruby, I cannot in good conscience recommend Cedarville to any prospective students. If CU leaders are willing to get rid of people like Dr. Ruby and yet unwilling to admit that they\u0026rsquo;ve done so, that\u0026rsquo;s not just disingenuous - it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous.\nI also cannot recommend a place which holds un-scholarly documents as the White Papers as official explanations of its doctrinal stances. I cannot recommend a place where people like Dr. Michael Pahl are not allowed to teach, and where good evangelicals are \u0026ldquo;reviewed\u0026rdquo; by ad hoc doctrinal panels. I cannot recommend a place where my mentors are harassed for being forthright with their students.

For now, as a current student of Cedarville University, I will content myself with asking questions, trying to make sense of all this, and encouraging the members of the CU community who have had the biggest impact on my life.\nWith people like Carl Ruby, Chris Williamson, and Bill Rudd gone, we\u0026rsquo;re quickly losing leaders at Cedarville who will advocate for these types of concerns. I\u0026rsquo;m therefore convinced that my time left at Cedarville will be better spent on encouragement than advocacy. Although I am unsatisfied with the recent decisions and direction of my University, there are still many good and godly women and men here whom I\u0026rsquo;d like to uplift and affirm before I graduate.\nAlthough I will no longer be a contributing member of Let There Be Light, I ask you to join with me in always calling for transparency and justice within our respective communities.

See, I love this place. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I can\u0026rsquo;t stand it sometimes. There are still so many good and godly women and men here, so much potential for God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom. And that\u0026rsquo;s why recent decisions made by Cedarville Admins and Trustees are so heartbreaking. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about this before (Open Letter).\nThe sources of my angst? I\u0026rsquo;ll give you the top three from my growing list of concerns.\nThe White Papers I found out about these a year ago, when I had no idea of the storm that was brewing. I won\u0026rsquo;t spend time repeating what\u0026rsquo;s already been well said about the Papers here and here, but suffice it to say that if I turned in a White Paper as an undergraduate theological essay, I\u0026rsquo;d be getting a C- and a talk from my professor for my sub-par work. It\u0026rsquo;s patently obvious that Bib/Theo scholars were NOT consulted in the composition of these documents. Or, if they were, they were summarily ignored. And CU is making PhDs in Bib/Theo studies sign these things! Despicable.\nThis seems like a shameful attempt of reigning in the \u0026ldquo;creeping liberalism\u0026rdquo; of Cedarville\u0026rsquo;s Bible department. First, if you know any of the conservative evangelical CU Bible faculty, you\u0026rsquo;ll realize that this is some sort of sick joke. Second, at least proofread your documents to the standards of good scholarship! Even if I agreed with the White Papers\u0026rsquo; attempts to silence debate and discussion on matters related to creation, justification, and omniscience, I would still be ashamed of their poor quality.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t read Cedarville\u0026rsquo;s White Papers, they can finally be found here (to the right), on the University website. We had to petition and then wait a couple months before the Administration publicly posted the White Papers, even though they are supposed to describe the University\u0026rsquo;s official position on three important areas of doctrine!!! Did Cedarville ever intend on releasing these documents if students hadn\u0026rsquo;t petitioned Dr. Gredy and Dr. Cornman? Or were the White Papers just supposed to be a secret weapon to cleanse the Bible faculty? Apparently they were important enough to be used in the firing of Dr. Michael Pahl.\nMichael Pahl Dr. Pahl was hired before the 2011-12 school year. He moved his family (wife and four children) all the way from Canada to Cedarville, OH, persuaded that he was going to be a good fit for the Bible department at Cedarville University. After all, the CU hiring process is lengthy and it\u0026rsquo;s a very long way to move one\u0026rsquo;s family. After teaching for just two semesters, and closing on a 100 year-old farmhouse in town, he was fired for a doctrinal discrepancy related to his book, The Beginning and The End.\nKeep in mind that the book was already in manuscript form when he was hired by CU, meaning that he wrote this book before he even knew he\u0026rsquo;d be working at a place that would have loved to see a shout out to Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis somewhere, anywhere in the tome\u0026rsquo;s 106 pages. Furthermore, the hiring committee was made aware of Dr. Pahl\u0026rsquo;s forthcoming book, and he taught his sample lecture during the hiring process on Genesis and the creation accounts! But that wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough to save him from getting \u0026ldquo;reviewed\u0026rdquo; by an ad hoc panel and \u0026ldquo;released from his teaching duties.\u0026rdquo;\nThankfully, he\u0026rsquo;s remained on the school\u0026rsquo;s payroll this academic year, so that he and his family didn\u0026rsquo;t get sent back to Canada right away without work or housing. However, to the best of my knowledge, he is still looking for work.\n\u0026ldquo;Dr. Pahl’s orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility. He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students. Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat a shameful way to treat a gracious and godly immigrant family.\nCarl Ruby As if the previous two concerns weren\u0026rsquo;t enough, the University quickly got rid of Carl Ruby, the Vice President for Student Life, this January. Not only have the Administration and Trustees neglected to justify this decision, they refuse to admit that they made the decision in the first place!!! According to the University PR statements, we\u0026rsquo;re to believe that Carl Ruby, after 25 years of service to his alma mater, randomly decided in January that now would be a great time to seek employment opportunities elsewhere. Apparently he also thought it would be great to leave his office just five days after his resignation was announced for him!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the other option? Moral or legal failure, right? Well, Dr. Gredy (acting CU President) himself denied this at the SGA Town Hall meeting last month, saying that Ruby\u0026rsquo;s resignation was not due to a personal/moral failure.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s left, then? Well, despite my University\u0026rsquo;s urging to \u0026ldquo;not connect the dots\u0026rdquo; on these matters, the unavoidable conclusion is that _Dr. Ruby was FIRED_and that CU Admins/Trustees are hesitant (and deceptively so) to admit that.\nCompare this \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; answer from the Cedarville Alumni and Family Questions and Answers page:\n\u0026ldquo;Why did Dr. Carl Ruby leave?\n\u0026ldquo;Dr. John Gredy, Provost, announced to the University family on January 10 that he and Dr. Ruby had come to a mutual understanding and that Dr. Ruby would conclude his service to Cedarville University. His last day in the office was shortly thereafter, although Dr. Ruby’s administrative contract continues through June 30. The University is committed to protecting the privacy of its employees so is not commenting publicly on the reasons for the decision.\n\u0026ldquo;Sadly, much speculation and questions have arisen. The Board of Trustees at its January 25 meeting carefully reviewed the events surrounding the announcement that Dr. Carl Ruby would conclude his service. The Board acknowledged and expressed regret that the lack of clarity had made this transition even more difficult for the Cedarville University family. Nonetheless, the Board of Trustees supported the understanding between Dr. Ruby and the administration. The Board of Trustees expressed its gratitude to Dr. Ruby for his service.\n\u0026ldquo;Dr. Ruby built a legacy at Cedarville, and he will be missed by many. The passions Dr. Ruby embraced were not simply his personal interests, but rather reflect core values of the Cedarville family. The University is committed to continuing these priorities.\u0026rdquo;\nwith this excerpt from the Dayton Daily News\u0026rsquo; most recent piece on Cedarville:\n\u0026ldquo;Tennessee Pastor Chris Williamson said he resigned from the school’s board of trustees after being “blindsided” by what he called the administration’s “mistreatment” of the vice president for student life, Carl Ruby, a popular 25-year veteran of Cedarville who resigned last month. [\u0026hellip;]\n\u0026ldquo;And then, on Jan. 10, it was announced Ruby would “step down” effective June 30. But his last day on campus was Jan. 15, and hundreds of students showed their support by wearing red and lining his walk from his office to his car. Ruby’s departure was publicly called a resignation. But Williamson said he learned at a January trustees’ meeting, “it was a termination of employment.”\nand with this excerpt from the New York Times piece on the Cedarville controversy:\n\u0026ldquo;The Rev. Chris Williamson of Franklin, Tenn., who last month resigned from the Cedarville board of trustees, said that both the president and Dr. Ruby were considered problematic by the faction of trustees fearful of what they perceive as a creeping liberalism. “They were threatened by Carl’s approach not to theology but to ministry,” Mr. Williamson said, “in terms of his ministry to people struggling with gender identification, how he ministers to people on the margins.”\nIt would be frustrating enough if it were a secular organization committing these injustices. But to watch an organization which claims the name of Christ behave in such despicable ways? It\u0026rsquo;s intolerable.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not the only one who\u0026rsquo;s frustrated by these things: consider Scot McKnight, Anthony LeDonne, LeDonne again, Michael Bird, Mark Goodacre, and James McGahey.\nNo, this does not mean that everyone at Cedarville is dishonest, evil or misguided. In fact, there are plenty of godly women and men here.

And as often as the Bible urges respect for leaders, it holds the leaders of the God\u0026rsquo;s people accountable even more so, often with strong language. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe me? Go and read the prophets, focusing on their words for the priests and princes of Israel.\nAs Chris Williamson put it on his Twitter account:\n\u0026ldquo;There’s nothing more dangerous to the cause of Christ than religious people with an ungodly agenda. #cedarville”\n( @gdk_chris; 12:49 PM – 1 Feb 13).\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t agree more.

[1]\nWithin this structure, the laws and treaty stipulations – general (5:1-11:32) and specific (12:1-26:19) – are given pride of place. After the setting and introduction to the covenant (4:44-49), Moses [2] begins his second sermon (5:1-28:69) with an interpretive restatement of the Decalogue (5:6-21), couched within an extended reflection on the initial law-giving at Horeb and Moses’ role as mediator (5:1-33).\nIn the passage at hand (6:1-15), he then transitions to the remainder of the general stipulations (6:1-11:32) with an introductory exhortation (6:1-3), a distillation of the covenant principles (6:4-5), and an extension of these principles to future generations and society (6:6-9), concluding with a warning against forgetfulness and idolatry as the Israelites soon enter the land of Canaan (6:10-15). In remembrance of and in response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, Israel must love Yahweh absolutely and exclusively by internalizing, embodying, and teaching covenant faithfulness as they inherit the blessings of the promised land.\nINTRODUCTORY EXHORTATION: 6:1-3 Moses begins this passage with an exhortation to keep the general stipulations of the covenant to be discussed in Deuteronomy 6-11. In response to Yahweh’s command (recounted at 5:31), Moses teaches the people the “commandments, statutes, and ordinances” (5:31, 6:1; referring to the covenant stipulations)[3] so that they will “carry them out in the land” (5:31, 6:1).\nThis transmission of the covenant stipulations from Yahweh to Moses to the Israelites was not meant to achieve a merely epistemic result, but also an ontic one. That is, Moses was not merely teaching them the stipulations so that they would merely know (and do) the right things, but so that they would be the right kind of people, internalizing and embodying the stipulations as they entered the promised land of Canaan. The intended result of the commandments, statutes, and ordinances was holistic covenant faithfulness.\nAt the heart of the appropriate epistemic and ontic response to the covenant stipulations was the proper fear of Yahweh their God (6:2a), which was to result in a continual obedience for generations upon generations (6:2b), [4] reflecting the importance of teaching covenant faithfulness to their children. [5] As the injunctions to “pay attention” and “be careful” (6:3a) indicate, this obedience was also to be careful and deliberate. [6] The promised results of such continual and careful covenant faithfulness are long life (6:2c) and many descendants (6:2b, 3a) in the bountiful promised land (6:1b, 3b), recalling Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to fulfill his promises of land and offspring to Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3. [7]\nDISTILLATION OF THE COVENANT PRINCIPLES: 6:4-5 Following the brief introduction to the general stipulations (6:1-3), Moses distills the Decalogue, itself an encapsulation of the entire covenant, into just sixteen Hebrew words, providing “the expression of the essence of all God’s person and purposes” (6:4-5). [8]\nNamed after the first Hebrew word in 6:4 ( shéma’, “hear, pay attention”), the “Great Shema” has long been regarded as central to Deuteronomy and to Israelite theology and praxis. [9] However, because of its brevity, the translation of the Shema (particularly 6:4) into English has been the topic of considerable debate. Although the initial imperative and vocative (“pay attention, Israel”) are clear enough, translating the remaining four terms (“Yahweh, our God, Yahweh, one”) into English involves making a decision on the placement of the copulative and the precise translation of ekhad as “one” or “alone.” [10]\nOn balance, given the statement’s quasi-poetic brevity, it seems best to render 6:4: “Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is one.” [11] This translation allows for a mediating position between Block’s arguments for rendering ekhad as “alone,” emphasizing God’s uniqueness, and Janzen’s arguments for God’s oneness as internal consistency and faithfulness to Israel. [12] Compared to the gamut of Canaanite and other ancient Near Eastern deities, Yahweh was indeed unique, [13] primarily because of his faithfulness to Israel from the patriarchs (6:3b, 10a), through the exodus (6:12), and into the imminent conquest of Canaan (6:1b, 3, 10-11). That “Yahweh is one” is not so much an ontological statement as it is a historical reflection [14] in remembrance of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to his covenant people.\nTherefore, in response to this unique faithfulness, Israel must love Yahweh absolutely (6:5), as seen by the concentric use of lebab (“heart,” the inner being, including emotion and intellect), nephesh (“soul,” the entire being, including desires), and me’od (“strength,” the physical being, including economic and social resources). [15] This is the only proper response to the God who is truly ekhad (6:4), [16] comprising the essential principle upon which the entire covenant rested. [17] Related to the previously mentioned fear of Yahweh and obedience to the covenant stipulations (6:1-3), loving Yahweh involves the epistemic/ontic response of internalizing (with the lebab and nephesh) and embodying (through the me’od) covenant faithfulness.\nEXTENSION TO FAMILY AND SOCIETY – 6:6-9 The proper love of Yahweh is absolute, permeating not only the entire person (6:5), but also all of life (6:6-9), [18] including the family unit (6:7) and society (6:8-9). Beginning again with the concept of epistemic internalization, Moses commands the Israelites to keep “these words” (referring to the entire covenant through the Shema) [19] on their hearts/minds (6:6).\nThis internalization of the covenant through constant reflection is then to be extended by teaching covenant faithfulness to future generations (6:7a), here described with an unusual verb ( shanan) which evokes the imagery of engraving a message into stone. [20] Just as Moses is teaching the Israelites the covenant stipulations, they must teach these things to their children through constant repetition and discussion of the faithful covenant lifestyle within the household, reflected through the double merism of 6:7b (sitting/walking; lying down/getting up). [21]\nFinally, this commitment to covenant faithfulness was to transcend the household and permeate the entire society (6:8-9). Although the instructions here (to “tie,” “fasten,” and “inscribe” the covenant stipulations on the forearm, forehead, and door frames, respectively) were taken literally in later Jewish tradition, [22] they were probably meant to be interpreted metaphorically. [23] In this case, 6:8 refers to the embodiment of the covenant principles in everyday life, identifying each individual Israelite as a faithful covenant member. [24]\nHowever, in 6:9 the exhortation to covenant faithfulness is then expanded to the household and the community as “these words” (6:6) are inscribed “on the doorframes of your houses and gates” (6:9). [25] In response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, the Israelites are to love him absolutely by internalizing (6:6), embodying (6:8-9), and teaching (6:7) covenant faithfulness.\n(For more even more biblical exposition, see my essay on Philemon.)\nWARNING AGAINST FORGETFUL IDOLATRY: 6:10-15 However, the proper love of Yahweh is also exclusive, for his uniqueness demands that he be worshipped alone. After distilling the covenant (6:4-5) and extending its essential claim to the family and society (6:6-9), Moses exhorts his audience to eschew all forms of forgetful idolatry. Instead, the Israelites are to love Yahweh exclusively as they inherit the blessings of the promised land, in remembrance of and in response to his unique faithfulness (6:10-15).\nThe historical context of this passage is especially important for the interpretation of 6:10-11. Moses reminds the Israelites of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness by linking the divine promises of land to the patriarchs with the fulfillment of those promises in the imminent conquest and occupation of Canaan. [26] The concrete description of the promised land in 6:10b-11 was designed to remind the audience that it was a blessing and a gift from Yahweh in faithful fulfillment of his kingly duties. [27] The warning in 6:12 to “be careful” reveals Moses’ anxiety that the sudden affluence the Israelites would experience in Canaan might lead them to forget their uniquely faithful God, who had redeemed them from the oppressive hand of the Egyptians and provided for them throughout the wilderness wanderings. [28]\nTherefore, 6:13 contains an intensely covenantal threefold call to the exclusive love of Yahweh alone. [29] As part of the proper response to Yahweh’s oneness (6:4), the Israelites are to fear only Yahweh, serve only Yahweh, and swear only by Yahweh’s name. [30] Moses then intensifies the warning even further in 6:14-15 with a rephrasing of the first two commandments (Deut 5:7-10). [31] On the basis of Yahweh’s righteous jealousy and the promised punishment of exile (5:9; 6:15; cf. 28:63; Lev 26:43), the Israelites are to love Yahweh exclusively by completely eschewing all forms of foreign idolatry (6:14). [32]\n(For an overview on how to read the bible, check out Amy Chase Ashley\u0026rsquo;s Scripture: Handle With Care.)\nCONCLUSION As an introduction to the main exposition of the general covenant stipulations (Deut 6-11), Moses begins with an exhortation, calling the Israelites to the proper internalized and embodied response to Yahweh’s commands, statutes, and ordinances: covenant faithfulness as they enter the promised land (6:1-3). Then, he presents the distilled essence of the covenant principles in 6:4-5: the demand for the absolute love of Yahweh on the basis of his unique faithfulness.\nThis essential covenant claim is then extended to the family unit and society in 6:6-9 as the Israelites are commanded to internalize, embody, and teach covenant faithfulness to future generations.\nFinally, in 6:10-15, in anticipation of the conquest of Canaan as a revelation of Yahweh’s unique faithfulness to the patriarchs and the nation, the people are sternly warned to eschew all forms of forgetful idolatry and instead to worship Yahweh alone.\nTherefore, taken as a whole, Deuteronomy 6:1-15 was written to teach its original audience that, in remembrance of and in response to Yahweh’s unique faithfulness, they were to love Yahweh absolutely and exclusively by internalizing, embodying, and teaching covenant faithfulness as they inherited the blessings of the promised land.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY (Links are affiliate links.)\nBlock, Daniel I. \u0026ldquo;How many is God?

Furthermore, I assume that the passage at hand was originally composed just prior to Moses’ death and the subsequent conquest of Canaan. With regards to setting, Carpenter places Moses in the plains of Moab on the eastern side of the Jordan River in either 1406 or 1229 B.C. The earliest extra-biblical account of the Israelites in Canaan, a stele erected by Merneptah in western Thebes, mentions them already in the land in 1209 B.C (Cf. Carpenter, 420).\n[3] J.G.

It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.\nAlthough this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.\nAn adequate case study of this phenomenon is the interpretation(s) of Romans 13:1-7, a text that has been used to justify everything from utter obedience to totalitarian regimes to unquestioning support of harsh anti-immigration laws. These seven verses from Paul’s epistle to the Romans have been grossly abused at numerous points since their original composition.\nIn Romans 13:1-7, Paul exhorts the Roman believers to apply his previous commands toward love (12:9), harmony (12:16), and peace (12:18) in the context of obedience to government (13:1-5) and the payment of taxes (13:6-7).\nFar from being a comprehensive condensation of the apostle’s beliefs regarding any and all governments past and present, this passage is a specific and historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, discouraging them from political unrest, disobedience, and rebellion in order to protect their testimony and the effectiveness of the Roman church in the gospel mission.\nThis thesis will be “proven” by appealing to the historical context of the original audience and the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10 in which this passage rests.\n(For more on the book of Romans, check out my sermon on Romans 1:1-17. Looking for a great commentary on Romans? Read this one by Doug Moo [affiliate link]!)\nHistorical Context When Romans 13:1-7 is read as if it was written in a modern North American context, it seems as though Paul is appealing to the sovereignty of God in the affairs of nations to remind us of the divinely-appointed nature of our free-market economy and federal constitutional republic.\nAll of this is supposedly done to prompt us toward active participation in our civil government and unquestioning obedience to all of its laws. After all, these verses come up in discussions of Christian political involvement, debates on just war theory vs. pacifism, and diatribes against illegal immigrants and those who desire to aid them.\nHowever, using these seven verses as a packet theology of church and state is problematic, even within the Pauline corpus alone. The same man who wrote Romans 13 also frequently took up themes in his writings that would challenge the power and authority of the Roman Empire, for the declaration that Jesus is Lord contains the implicit declaration that Caesar is not. Our understanding of these seven verses must, therefore, be able to mesh with other passages (such as Phil 2:6-11; 3:20-21; 1 Thess 1:9-10; and 4:13-5:11) and their implications on relations between church and state. [1]\nMany commentators in recent years have recognized the importance of interpreting this passage in light of its historical context at the time of its composition (c. A.D. 57 [2]), instead of assuming that these verses are Paul’s fundamental views on how church and state should relate to each other. [3]\nKnowledge of the situation facing the Roman Christians in A.D. 57 is crucial to the interpretation of this text. Emperor Claudius had expulsed Jews from the city of Rome in A.D. 49, removing Jewish believers from the Roman church and therefore leaving only Gentile Christians behind in their stead. [4]\nHowever, Claudius was killed by his wife Agrippina in A.D. 54, and her son Nero advanced to the throne that same year, immediately allowing the Jews to return to the city. When Romans was written by Paul in A.D. 57, the Empire enjoyed a period of peace that looked quite different from the chaos that would characterize the later years of Nero’s reign.\nGuided by his advisor Seneca, Nero made promises of a different and better peace than the pax romana of Augustus. He promised true peace, characterized by restraint and the peaceful resistance to using force in order to govern. While these promises were dashed beginning in A.D. 59, with Nero’s matricide, the loss of his advisors, and the beginning of his persecution of Christians, it is crucial to remember that Paul wrote Romans during the period of hopeful peace from A.D. 54-59.\nRomans 13:1-7 should not, therefore, be interpreted as if it were written to Roman believers in the later years of Nero’s reign, when persecution and oppression were rampant, for this would unduly strengthen Paul’s “pro-Empire” sentiments here. [5]\nWith this background information, it is easy to see why Paul here gives advice to his readers, a cosmopolitan church in Rome struggling to figure out Jew-Gentile dynamics in the early years of Nero’s reign, so as to prevent them from drawing negative attention to themselves and damaging the effectiveness of the gospel mission.\nAlthough things were presumably “going well,” as mentioned above, Paul knew full well that things could get tense for the Roman believers very quickly. Despite the period of relative peace from A.D. 54-59, tensions were rising in Rome in A.D. 57-58 regarding the particularly nasty practice of indirect taxation. Furthermore, the Jewish believers who had returned to the city in A.D. 54 might not have been on the best terms with neither the Roman authorities nor the Gentile believers. Much of what Paul has to say in this epistle speaks to this issue: the relationship between Jewish and Gentile Christians within the Roman context.\nIt is not, therefore, unreasonable to assume that this played a role in the social tension Paul here addresses in Romans 13:1-7. Furthermore, revolutionary sentiments were in vogue at this time among the Jews in Palestine, and Paul was perhaps worried that the fervor would spread to the Roman church and quickly create some serious problems given the tensions within the church and its social context. [6]\nPositively, then, when Romans was written, the original audience enjoyed a period of relative peace and stability before the chaotic upheaval that would take place in A.D. 59.\nNegatively, there was still quite a bit of tension within and around the Roman church which had the potential to divide the church and get the Christians in serious trouble with Roman authorities if rebellion became the rallying cry for the followers of Jesus, assured of the lordship of their King and the reality of his kingdom.\nIt is therefore a mistake to read Romans 13:1-7 as a justification of the sins of the state, as if this passage gave a carte blanche to the atrocities to be committed in the later years of Nero’s reign. Paul was capable of saying negative things about pagan governments when they were going awry [7], but he nevertheless appealed to God’s sovereignty over human governments in order to prevent the tense situation of his audience from erupting into a social upheaval that would wreck the church’s testimony and hinder the gospel mission in the city of Rome and the empire over which that city ruled.\nHis audience then (and readers of the epistle today) would not, therefore, be expected to never challenge the government or abstain from promoting or participating in its practices, as Romans 13:1-7 has often been used to argue. Instead, they were (and are) to wisely interact with human governments, not seeking to cause any trouble in society that would damage their testimony, but not hesitating to stand firm in the cause of Christ their King when human governments do things contrary to the kingdom of God. [8] Wright pulls these themes together quite well:\n[P]recisely because of all the counter-imperial hints Paul has given not only in this letter and elsewhere but indeed by his entire gospel, it is vital that he steer Christians away from the assumption that loyalty to Jesus would mean the kind of civil disobedience and revolution that merely reshuffles the political cards into a different order. […] The main thing Paul wants to emphasize is that, even though Christians are servants of the Messiah, the true lord, this does not give them carte blanche to ignore the temporary subordinates whose appointed task, whether (like Cyrus) they know it or not, is to bring at least a measure of God’s order and justice to the world. The church must live as a sign of the kingdom yet to come, but since that kingdom is characterized by justice, peace, and joy in the Spirit [14.17], it cannot be inaugurated in the present by violence and hatred. [9]\nThese sentiments and those outlined above will now be augmented by a brief examination of Roman 13:1-7 within the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10. [10]\nScriptural Context: Romans 12:9-13:10 The passage at hand only makes sense within the overarching context of Romans 12:9-13:10. Although Paul undoubtedly changes topics at 13:1, the thematic links between 13:1-7 and 12:9-21 are difficult to ignore. KakoV (“evil”) and agaqoV (“good”) occur in Rom 12:17, 21 and 13:3-4. Orgh (“wrath”) is mentioned in 12:19 and 13:4, 5. Also, conceptually, vengeance is mentioned in 12:19 and 13:4. [11] It is therefore quite reasonable to see a connection between 13:1-7 and 12:9-21.\nThe links between this passage and the one immediately preceding it, however, should not overshadow the importance of the thematic verses earlier in 12:1-2. There Paul effectively redefines the people of God as no longer just Jews, but Gentiles as well. This is a common enough theme throughout the entire epistle and in almost all of Paul’s writings, [12] but in Romans 12:1-15:13, it is of particular importance.\nHaving spent the first eleven chapters of the epistle explaining the identity of the people of God as a mix of Jews and Gentiles and defending the covenant loyalty of God in the process, Paul now devotes chapters 12-15 to redefining the “rule of life” of the people of God. [13] In 12:9-21, Paul proclaims “love as the fundamental moral imperative in human relationships,” [14] urging his readers to pursue harmony (12:16) and peace (12:18). He then redefines in 13:1-7 how the people of God in the church at Rome should relate to the power structures of the society in which they dwell.\nRomans 12:9-21 is one of the most loosely-constructed passages in the entire epistle. This means that it would take quite a bit of time and space to comprehensively analyze the syntax and detailed meaning of the passage. However, some general observations are in order.\nThe thematic verse of this paragraph is 12:9 (NET) [15], “Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.” From there, Paul emphasizes the important manifestations of genuine love: mutual devotion and eagerness in showing honor (12:10), enthusiastic spiritual service (12:11), hopeful joy and persistent prayer in the face of suffering (12:12), and hospitably meeting the needs of the saints (12:13). Harmony is commanded within and outside the church, extending even to persecutors (12:14, 16). Instead of responding in kind to their persecutors and therefore being “overcome by evil” (12:21a), Paul urges them to live peaceably (12:17-18), forbidding them from taking vengeance into their own hands (12:19). Instead, the Roman believers are to “overcome evil with good” (12:21b), and this is illustrated in 12:20, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will be heaping burning coals on his head.”\nAt this point after 12:21, most modern English readers of Scripture are confronted by a large “13” and perhaps a subject heading, such as “Submission to Civil Government.” The advantages of verse and chapter divisions for Bible reading and study are well-known. However, the chapter division here has had detrimental effects on the exegesis of this passage.\nAlthough seemingly a very minor change, it puts undue emphasis on Paul’s supposed change of topic, prompting the interpretations of many that this is Paul’s comprehensive theology of church and state relations, ignoring the passage’s context and the historical situation of the original audience, who would have heard this epistle read without the explanation of a chapter division or sub-heading.\nRomans 13:1-7 is most naturally read as the unpacking of the principles of 12:9-21, in the context of how Christians in Rome should behave in relation to the powers that governed the society in which they dwelt. It answers the implied question (after reading 12:9-21): “Paul, if we are to do these things (love genuinely, pursue harmony and peace, do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good, etc.), how should this apply in regards to our relationship with the rulers of our city and empire?”\nThe specific rules that governed the theocracy of ancient Israel no longer held sway for the international and multi-ethnic body of Christ. As noted above, the situation in Rome, although relatively peaceful, was still quite tense within and outside of the church. Jews and Gentiles were struggling to remain unified in the Messiah in spite of their cultural differences.\nFurthermore, Jews in Rome, only recently allowed back into the city, may have been culturally stigmatized as superstitious and unwanted. Tensions were building because of indirect taxation. And Jews in Palestine were growing more and more rebellious. [16]\nIt is not therefore hard to imagine why Paul felt the pastoral need to apply the principles of 12:9-21 to the realm of society and government. A “perfect storm” was brewing underneath the surface, one that could put the Christians in Rome at odds with not only each other but with the Roman Empire itself very quickly if the believers there tended towards promoting social unrest, perhaps due to an over-realized eschatology that would want to usher in the kingdom of God by overthrowing Roman rule. If the Christians in Rome made a wrong move, evil could quickly overcome them.\nWhile a full analysis of the argument of the text at hand is beyond the scope of this essay, a brief trace of the thought-flow of Romans 13:1-7 will aid in comprehension of its contextually-appropriate meaning. The general command to submit to the authorities is found in 13:1a, and is reiterated in 13:5.\nThe first reason for this submission is that the authorities have been appointed by God (13:1b). Logically, then, those who oppose the authorities oppose “the ordinance of God” (13:2b). The consequence of disobeying the general command is therefore God’s judgment [17] (13:2b).\nThe second reason for submission is that the rulers are servants of God to commend good and to administer retribution to evil, although these two verses can also be seen as support for the claim that those who resist the authorities can expect judgment on earth [18] (13:3-4).\nPaul then restates the main thesis of 13:1-4 in 13:5, urging his readers to submit because of “wrath” (they would face judgment if disobedient) and “conscience” (they would be opposing God’s ordinance). He then closes this paragraph with an appeal to the readers’ current practice of paying taxes in submission to the government (13:6), urging them therefore to continue respectfully in what they have already been doing (13:7). [19]\nWhen unhindered by the chapter division, it is easy to see how Romans 13:1-7 relates to 12:9-21. The genuine love commanded in 12:9a would be quite hard to apply to the impersonal institution of the Roman government. On the other hand, it would have been quite easy for the rebellious attitudes of the Jews in Palestine to seep into the Roman context, prompting the Roman Christians to rebel and try and institute the kingdom of God in opposition to Roman rule.\nPaul steps in and applies the principles of non-violence, non-retribution, and enemy love (12:14, 17, 18-20) to the context of government and society. In order to “overcome evil with good” (12:21) when it came to the Roman powers, the believers in Rome were not to rebel violently or cause unnecessary civil unrest, but to submit to the governing authorities (13:1a) with the acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty over the said powers (13:1b).\nIt would be a mistake, however, to go to the other end of the spectrum and argue that Paul is urging his audience to give unthinking and critical approval of everything the Roman government did. As mentioned above, Paul was more than willing to critique governments and empires for the sake of God’s kingdom and the cause of Christ.\nIt would also be a mistake to argue that Romans 13:1-7 is a justification for the active participation in government activities (political office, warfare, etc.) both ancient and modern. Although God is still sovereign over modern nations, Paul’s argument here does not address the issue of active Christian participation in government because that was not on the radar of first-century Christian life in the Roman Empire.\nInstead, Paul’s main point is that his readers should not revolt, but that they should instead stay out of trouble by obeying the authorities and participating in the basic constructs of their society (i.e. paying taxes).\nThe argument for placing 13:1-7 in the overarching context of Paul’s focus on genuine love in 12:9-13:10 is strengthened by his return to the topic of love in 13:8-10. After the sobering instruction to not rebel but to stay out of trouble and obey the governing authorities, Paul reminds his audience of the importance of love, not only of enemy (of which it could be strongly argued that the governing authorities were a subset!), but of neighbor.\nThis returns the Roman Christians’ focus to love as the central virtue of Christianity and the “fulfillment of the law” (13:8, 10). They were to faithfully follow Jesus the Messiah King, seeking to bring in his kingdom. But it was unthinkable to Paul to effect God’s kingdom in a way that ran against the grain of that kingdom of love, justice, and peace. Therefore, in the middle of exhortations to genuinely love one’s enemies and neighbors, Paul urges his audience to humbly obey their governing authorities so that they might remain faithful to their King’s calling as they went about his work in the city of Rome.\n(For more on the book of Romans, check out my summary of the book\u0026rsquo;s argument/story.)\nConclusion Through the ignorance of the historical background of Paul’s epistle to the Romans as a whole and his instructions in Romans 13:1-7 in particular, the passage at hand has been grossly mis-read and mis-applied in numerous ways since its original composition. Instead of an argument for unthinking obedience to, approval of, and participation in governments past and present, Paul here argues for the Christians in Rome not to revolt against the empire in an attempt to fully usher in God’s kingdom, but to submit humbly to the Roman authorities as they sought to overcome evil with good.\nHaving an understanding of both the historical background and the context of this passage in the overall argument of the epistle yields an appropriately nuanced view of Paul’s pastoral concern for his audience expressed in these seven controversial verses. Although it is tempting to take this passage out of context and use it to justify opinions on everything from immigration to just war theory, the same hubris that Paul implicitly rebukes in these verses must be resisted if the Scriptures are to be heard and appropriated well.\nWhile some may wish that Romans 13:1-7 had more to say regarding the relationship between church and state, the passage certainly cannot say less than the main points briefly described above. Romans 13:1-7 is not a condensed theology of church and state, but a specific historically-conditioned pastoral address to the Roman believers, diverting them from rebellion and urging them towards humble submission in order to protect their testimony and thereby enhance their effectiveness in God’s redemptive mission.\n(For a theological essay about what the Bible is and why it\u0026rsquo;s important, read this piece.)\nBibliography (Links are affiliate links.)\nBray, Gerald, ed.

Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2005.\nNotes [1] A full analysis of the legitimacy of an anti-imperial Pauline hermeneutic far exceeds the scope of this study. Wright (2004: 82-88 and 2005: 69-79) emphasizes what he sees to be Paul’s anti-imperial themes throughout his writings, and I am indebted to him for the concept of Jesus’ vs. Caesar’s lordship. For an even-handed overview and analysis of this topic, consult Kim (2008), who makes the case that a strong anti-imperial Pauline hermeneutic is difficult to maintain. Despite Kim’s conclusions, however, it seems unwise to completely ignore the implications of Christ’s lordship on both Roman believers in the first century and on North American ones today. The fact that Romans 13:1-7 is such a stumbling block to those in the anti-imperial camp and such an “anomaly” when compared with the implications of Paul’s anti-imperial passages (such as 1 Thess 5, alluded to by Wright [2005]) seems to necessitate a nuanced approach that hears the arguments of those on both sides of this theological debate.\n[2] The commentaries and resources consulted in this study provided A.D. 57 as a consensus view of the date of composition of Paul’s epistle to the Romans.\n[3] (Kim 2008: 37), who points to P. Stuhlmacher, Paul’s Letter to the Romans: A Commentary, trans. S. J. Hafeman (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster John Knox, 1994), 198-208; J. A. Fitzmyer, Romans AB 33 (New York: Doubleday, 1993), 662-63. Also, consult Dunn (1988: 768-69).\n[4] Ibid., 37.\n[5] The background information in this paragraph comes from the helpful discussion in Witherington III (2004: 304-6).\n[6] Consult the discussion in Kim (2008: 37) for a helpful counterbalance to the optimistic portrait painted by Witherington III (2004: 304-6). I am also very much indebted to the discussion as the source of the historical information in this paragraph.\n[7] Cf. Witherington III (2004: 307): “That Paul could say very different and negative things about the state when the state was malfunctioning at the end of Claudius’ reign seems clear enough from 1 and 2 Thessalonians, particularly in 2 Thessalonians 2.” And also consider Wright’s (2004: 86) insistence that Paul had the ability to critique human government: “…in those stories (his visit to Philippi in Acts 16, for instance, or his trial before the Jewish authorities in Acts 23), that precisely when the authorities are getting it all wrong and acting illegally or unjustly Paul has no hesitation in telling them their proper business and insisting that they should follow it.”\n[8] Passionate Aside: The main problem, then, in applying this passage today, is a very narrow vision of what God’s kingdom entails. That is, “obey your government unless it tells you to do something contrary to the Word of God” is a common enough teaching in the church today, but our vision of God’s redemptive mission is so emaciated that it causes us to miss glaring issues of concern (immigration, warfare, racism, etc.) in our society today. We rape the Scriptures when Romans 13:1-7 is used to justify such ignorance of and even the active participation in streams of society, culture, and policy which go against the grain of God’s kingdom.\n[9] (Wright 2005: 78-79), emphasis mine.\n[10] I am indebted to Dr. Robert Milliman and his blog-post Love and War: Romans 13.1 – 7 in the Context of 12.9 – 13.10 (2011) for the initial idea of examining this passage in its context to avoid mis-readings of the text which have been used to justify everything from totalitarian regimes to Christian service in the military.\n[11] Schreiner (1998: 678) provides these examples of textual and conceptual links between the two passages. Dunn (1988: 758) also mentions the phrases ekdikew / ekdikoV (12:19; 13:4) and pantwn anqrwpwn / pasin (12:17-18; 13:7) to provide evidence for a link between the two passages, before demonstrating links between Romans 2:7-11 and 13:3-4 in order to refute the claims of some that this passage is a non-Pauline insertion.\n[12] I appeal to Dr. Chris Miller’s class notes from BENT 4110 – Romans and Galatians(Spring 2012), and also Wright’s work on Romans (2004) to prove this point, for a complete discussion of this common theme exceeds the scope of this essay. However, for an overview of this theme in Romans, Dunn (1988: 705) cites Rom 1:16-17; 2:15, 17, 28-29; 3:20, 29; 4:16; 9:8, 12; 11:6, 30-32.\n[13] Dunn (1988: 705) sees chapters 12-15 as providing a replacement to Lev 18:5 (“this do and live”) as the rule of life for the people of God: “…‘the walk in newness of life’ as over against the walk in the ordinances of Israel’s law (6:4), the service in newness of Spirit as over against oldness of letter (7:6), the obedience of faith in accord with the Spirit fulfilling the requirement of the law unconfused with Jewish ‘works’ (8:4).”\n[14] Ibid., 706.\n[15] All Bible quotations, unless otherwise noted, come from the NET Bible.\n[16] Here I summarize my conclusions from “Historical Background” above.\n[17] Schreiner (1998: 679) notes that there is considerable debate as to whether this refers to the eschatological judgment of God or to judgment imposed by earthly rulers. He appeals to the structure of the text (gar in 3a) to conclude that the latter option is more likely.\n[18] Ibid., 680.\n[19] I am indebted to Moo (1996: 794) and Schreiner (1998: 680) for this overview of the passage’s argument.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/romans-13/","summary":"This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing.

I do not want to underestimate your care and concern for this place. In fact, I want to reassure you that I share your passion. Here at Cedarville I have been blessed with the opportunity of meeting, falling in love with, and marrying my wife. Even more importantly, at Cedarville I have fallen in love with the Gospel. Thanks to godly men and women here - whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I\u0026rsquo;ve been privileged to catch - my eyes have been opened to the richness, complexity, and scope of God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive mission.\nI therefore raise the following concerns not as one who wants to malign Cedarville, disregard your wisdom, or perpetrate verbal violence. I raise them because I want Cedarville to contribute to God\u0026rsquo;s Kingdom to the fullest extent possible. I have invested four years of my life here as a CU Scholar, Getting Started Leader, Discipleship Leader, Student Grader, and Resident Assistant. I want future students, perhaps my own children someday, to be able to do the same. I want this University to thrive, inspiring true greatness for the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.\nThat is why certain events within the Cedarville community this past year have caused me such great concern. I say this as respectfully as possible: some of your decisions and actions seem to contradict the most precious lessons that I have learned at your institution about the Gospel.\nAmong other troubling things, including the harassment of those \u0026ldquo;godly men and women here - whose vision of God, his Word, and his world I\u0026rsquo;ve been privileged to catch,\u0026quot; I have observed the following:\nyour approval of the White Papers on omniscience, justification, and creation, your rejection of the proposed Theology Major, your dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl, the untimely resignation of Dr. William Brown, the extremely untimely resignation of Dr. Carl Ruby, your imminent cancellation of the Philosophy Major, and subsequent imminent release of either Dr. Shawn Graves or Dr. David Mills. As your younger brother in Christ, I am obligated to approach you peacefully. However, given the circumstances, it seems I am also obligated to approach you prophetically. Because of the biblical concept of shalom as true peace, I believe I can do both at the same time. For true peace is not the absence of conflict or strong words, but the longing of the prophets for the time and place where the image-bearers of Yahweh will be reconciled to one another, to all of creation, and to God himself. It is the relational fullness and completeness of God\u0026rsquo;s justice-based, truth-filled, and transparent Kingdom.\nIn the interests of shalom, then, I cry out for justice.\nIn the interests of shalom, I cry out for truth.\nIn the interests of shalom, I cry out for transparency.\nFor brevity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I\u0026rsquo;d like to distill my myriad concerns and frustrations into just two questions. After all, I\u0026rsquo;m just an undergraduate, and you do not owe me a thorough explanation of all the managerial minutiae behind your every move. However, you do owe me – along with current/future faculty, staff, students, and constituency – a thorough and impeccably honest explanation of Cedarville University\u0026rsquo;s Identity and Vision.\nIn the interests of shalom, justice, truth, and transparency, I cry out for answer to the following two questions:\nWhat is Cedarville University? What does Cedarville University hope to become? All of your actions and decisions mentioned above, from the harassment of my mentors and friends to the proposed cancellation of the Philosophy Major, point towards Cedarville University being and becoming a fundamentalist( euphemistically, a \u0026ldquo;conservative evangelical\u0026rdquo;) institution– silencing honest dialogue, erecting thick walls between “us” and “them,” and carving out our own niche instead of engaging the unified diversity of God’s kingdom.\nAfter all, Dr. Ruby and Dr. Brown were two of Cedarville\u0026rsquo;s most prominent voices calling for a robust evangelicalism, for this self-proclaimed liberal arts university to embrace and embody both cultural and ideological diversity - in the hopes of becoming one of the most influential Christ-centered learning communities in the twenty-first century.\nI and many others came to Cedarville University to study, work, and teach because we find this vision extremely compelling. We find things like poorly-written White Papers, inadequately explained rejections/cancellations of valuable majors, and questionable, sudden changes in beloved personnel much less compelling.\nI will give you the benefit of the doubt and not discuss at-length the many rumors and reports of shameful things like ad hoc and biased \u0026ldquo;review\u0026rdquo; panels, bullying, power plays, and gag orders. If the rumors be true, then perhaps someone much higher than I should call for your repentance, if not your resignations. Such is the high responsibility of having \u0026quot; For the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus Christ\u0026rdquo; as your institutional motto.\nHowever, I will ask you for one important thing: your honesty about where you want to take Cedarville University.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s why: as the Administration and Board of Trustees, you have a certain right to decide whether or not Cedarville will be robustly evangelical or fundamentalist. We might strongly disagree about which of those two options is preferable, but at the end of the day you make that decision, not I.\nHowever, you have no right to obfuscate or vacillate on these important matters of identity and vision. While I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you what direction to take this University, I can boldly ask that you decide and then very clearly and publicly announce your decision.\nEven if I and many others disagree with your decision, we will respect you much more for your clarity. Trying to accomplish your goals behind the scenes has only resulted in confusion, damage, and pain to several individuals and families within the Cedarville community. In the wake of Dr. Pahl\u0026rsquo;s dismissal and the questionable resignations of Dr. Brown and Dr. Ruby, we need a clear statement, not a polished and vague press release. If you don\u0026rsquo;t plainly declare your position and objectives, then we will be forced to assume the worst regarding your motives.\nAfter all, if achieving your goals involves getting rid of:\nMichael Pahl, an outstanding biblical theologian of whom you were willing to say: \u0026ldquo;[his] orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility. He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students.\u0026rdquo; William Brown, the president and beloved face of Cedarville University for thousands of students. and Carl Ruby, a man whose respect and admiration from students, faculty, and staff transcend cultural, theological, and political dispositions…a preeminent model of Christ-like service, love, patience, respect, grace, and wisdom…and a pioneer for open and honest dialogue for the sake of God’s Kingdom. …then your goals are probably in need of revision, but they are most certainly in need of immediate clarification.\nFor the sake of our Messiah, Savior, Lord, and King whose crown our University bears on its seal, I appeal to you as your younger brother in the faith: publicly declare your vision for the future of Cedarville University. In the face of the growing angst, confusion, and frustration among students, alumni, faculty, staff, and constituency, explicitly state who you do and do not want working, teaching, and therefore studying at the University.\nIt is my prayer that, as a result of your honesty and transparency, Cedarville University might become a more peaceful and just community in the midst of God’s shalom-filled Kingdom.\nFor King and Kingdom,\nJoshua Steele\nCedarville University Class of 2013\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/open-letter-to-cedarville-admins-and-trustees/","summary":"To my sisters and brothers in Christ, entrusted with the arduous task of leading and directing Cedarville University: greetings, grace, and peace.\nAllow me to thank you all for your countless hours of service to this institution.

(pt. 1 and pt. 2),\u0026rdquo; please go do so before reading this post. Summary: I\u0026rsquo;ve been blogging in order to raise awareness of Cedarville University\u0026rsquo;s recent dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl from his teaching post. Using the University\u0026rsquo;s statement on Dr. Pahl, I\u0026rsquo;ve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:\nWhy were the five accolades attached to Dr. Pahl above ( in the statement, orthodox, gospel, Scripture, scholar, teacher) not enough to keep him on the teaching faculty of Cedarville University? Don’t we want promising scholars and dedicated teachers who are committed to the gospel, to Scripture, and to orthodoxy at Cedarville University? If not, why not? I\u0026rsquo;m writing today because the responses I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to those posts and questions have been mixed. Some think I\u0026rsquo;m doing something that is both righteous and necessary, respectfully raising awareness and asking uncomfortable-yet-necessary questions. Others think I\u0026rsquo;m being un-biblical and disrespectful in my approach, and that I should handle these matters privately (cf. Matt 18:15-22 and such).\nClearly, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit biased toward the first reaction. It\u0026rsquo;s always more pleasant to think of your actions as both righteous and necessary, after all. However, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t negate the careful line to walk in this situation. Several things must be held in Christ-honoring tension, such as boldness and respect, honesty and love, persistence and patience, a hunger for justice and an even stronger craving for God\u0026rsquo;s perfect shalom peace.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been personally challenged by Dr. Pahl\u0026rsquo;s recent blog post. How, in the face of injustice, are we to hold David\u0026rsquo;s cries for vengeance in Psalm 54 in tension with Paul\u0026rsquo;s calls for peace in Romans 12:14, 17a? Consider this quote from Dr. Pahl\u0026rsquo;s conclusion:\nWhen we experience injustice, then, we are to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. We cry out to God in our suffering, even in the raw depths of our agony, trusting God to walk with us through the suffering, entrusting our vindication to God in his timing and his way. We speak truth to ourselves and to others, even to those who have committed the injustice, even to those in power, naming sin and evil for what it is. We resist evil by refusing to engage in evil acts ourselves; we resist violence done to us by refusing to engage in violence ourselves, whether violent actions or violent words. Instead, we engage in acts of self-giving, life-giving love for the other. And through it all we remind ourselves of our own sin, now forgiven, as we see the sin of others against us, waiting to be forgiven.\nHis words above, along with Dr. Tim Gombis\u0026rsquo; words in \u0026ldquo;The Logic of Religious Violence\u0026rdquo; are at the front of mind as I pursue these issues.\nChristians, however, must draw upon God’s grace to remain in the shape of the cross even when our survival appears to be at stake, or when things appear to be out of control in our culture. Remaining in the shape of the cross (refusing to retaliate, returning evil with good, loving those who hate us, controlling ourselves to speak kindly to those with whom we disagree) embodies faith in the resurrection and trust in God’s sovereignty. [\u0026hellip;]\nLet’s remember that cruciformity is the only way of hope and promise for those who confess loyalty to the Lord Christ. The way of violence (rhetorical and physical) is only and always the way of death.\nIf anyone suggests that I somehow hate Cedarville University and am merely trying to damage its reputation, that simply is not true. On the contrary, I have a deep love for Cedarville. I have been richly blessed by God during my time here, and it is my sincere hope that the students who come after me have the chance to grow and thrive even more than I have. If you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me, please read my previous post, \u0026ldquo;My Unforgettable Cedarville Experience.\u0026rdquo;\nDr. Pahl\u0026rsquo;s dismissal, therefore, concerns me precisely because I care about Cedarville University. While I do not want to respond to what I believe is injustice with rhetorical violence of my own, I also do not want to ignore the dismissal of a godly professor over one of the best books I have ever read ( The Beginning and The End, with its remarkably non-incendiary handling of two of the most vitriolic areas of Christian doctrine).\nFurthermore, I do not believe that the principles of Matthew 18:15-22 directly apply in this situation. This is not an interpersonal conflict I have with a brother or sister in Christ, this is an institution\u0026rsquo;s action which I believe to be both unjust and troubling.\nYes, Cedarville University is a very visible Christ-centered learning community, and it should be treated with respect and dignity. I do not want to needlessly damage its reputation, especially in the eyes of non-believers. However, Cedarville is an organization, and as such it needs to be held to a high standard when it comes to things like truth, justice, and transparency\u0026hellip;especially because it claims to be a Christ-centered community!\nIn closing, two things:\nIf godly professors like Dr. Pahl can write a book the quality of The Beginning and the End, and even be praised (in the statement regarding his dismissal, no less) as orthodox and committed to Scripture, the gospel, promising scholarship, and dedicated teaching, and still be relieved from teaching duties, then no faculty member is safe. This move does not seem to promote the gospel, God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom, or even academic freedom\u0026hellip;it instead promotes a culture of fear and \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; vs. \u0026ldquo;them.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s why we need things like truth and transparency after something like this happens.\nIf students like myself cannot respectfully-yet-openly question such events out of concern for not only professors like Dr. Pahl, but for the entire institution\u0026rsquo;s future and health, something is wrong. And if we are instead punished, censored, or encouraged toward indifference, something is profoundly wrong.\nPlease hold me accountable to my desires to honor Christ in this endeavor. He is my King and deserves my full allegiance. And please, if you claim the name of Christ, care about matters such as this.\n“The opposite of love is not hate, it\u0026rsquo;s indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it\u0026rsquo;s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it\u0026rsquo;s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it\u0026rsquo;s indifference.” ― Elie Wiesel\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/an-explanation/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t read my previous two blog posts, \u003ca href=\"http://windowinthesky.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/\" title=\"Cedarville, Let there be Light.

I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and then I learned more about how to study the Bible.\nAnd now I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure that people like Ken Ham are really about humbly submitting to what Scripture has to say. Instead, they seem to hold tightly to an anti-intellectual hermeneutic of suspicion and paranoia.It\u0026rsquo;s all about \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; vs. \u0026ldquo;them,\u0026rdquo; about building thick walls and banishing the \u0026ldquo;crazy liberals\u0026rdquo; from our midst. And the more I listen to the rhetoric, the more I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that anyone can become a crazy liberal, so long as they disagree with key figures such as Ken Ham about anything.\nConsider the following quote from a review of The Anointed: Evangelical Truth in a Secular Age (by R. Stephens and K. Giberson):\nKen Ham, with no scientific credentials, no credentials in biblical scholarship, no evidence, and no research program, has become the front person, the spokesman for a large segment of evangelicalism. He proves nothing, he asserts what he finds to be truth and tells a story to make it so. He is a charismatic speaker on a mission and has become for many the authority on the evil of evolution and the dishonesty of modern science. Ken Ham and his organization Answers in Genesis have become “ powerful shapers of popular opinion in America’s vast evangelical subculture.”\nKen Ham is an anointed and respected authority in much of American evangelicalism and fundamentalism.\nOne of the premises of Stephens and Giberson is that the broader evangelical culture has become enamored of the charismatic individual who can tell a good story, do it in a flashy and entertaining fashion, and has a message easily reduced to simple black and white points. Ken Ham is such an individual.\nWhy is Ken Ham believed?\nPeople like Ken Ham and AiG claim to have a high view of Scripture and to hold to a \u0026ldquo;literal\u0026rdquo; reading\u0026hellip; but in reality, I think that they have a low view of Scripture because they are unwilling to even consider that certain passages were not written to answer the questions we might like them to answer for us! If we don\u0026rsquo;t even try to approach the text on its own terms, then I would argue that we\u0026rsquo;re being unfaithful to Scripture.\nFor those of you still reading who don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m a crazy liberal yet (I can assure you, I\u0026rsquo;m not), consider the following resources as first steps in moving beyond Ken Ham, AiG, and the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism, to what Scripture actually has to say about creation!\n[youtube=http://youtu.be/5bKa92eLkQM]\nCheck out my blog post on Biblical Creation Theology.\n\u0026hellip;and the paper I wrote on how biblical creation theology leads to doxology.\nAlso, the following are some interesting posts for anyone interested:\nThe Evangelical Brain Trust (NYT) Anointed? \u0026hellip; Evangelicals and Authority (RJS) Ken Ham is a Con Artist\u0026hellip; (via Patheos)\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/sacrificing-scripture-on-the-altars-of-our-own-agendas/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUndoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions.

However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions. [1] The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple. [2] Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.\nThe New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17). [3] In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation. [4] Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20). [5] Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both made(poievw). [6]\nDoxologically, the link between creation and redemption is hard to overemphasize, for it provides the explanation, impetus, and goal of worship. By creating anew through Jesus the Messiah, the perfect Eikon [7] or Tselem (image) of God who has defeated Sin and Death, Elohim has begun to renew his holy temple, even as it yearns for full release from its bondage to decay. [8] This act of re-creation begins in the crucifixion and resurrection of the Messiah, reversing Death itself and displaying Jesus Christ as the pioneer of a new humanity, one untouched by God’s cosmic enemies. It continues in the Church, as the priest-kings are re-created in Christ and his resurrection into a new race of people able to worship their Maker by participating in the renewal of his universe, by once again extending his rule throughout the sacred realm, and by living in right relationship to him, to creation, to each other, and to themselves as they await the return of their Creator, Redeemer, and King, Jesus the Messiah. [9]\nCONCLUSION In light of these things, to relegate the manifold and rich uses of creation theology throughout Scripture to an ongoing origins debate which is thoroughly detached from the biblical text would be a tragedy. At the risk of oversimplification, the myriad creation themes in the Scriptures all lead to one common goal: doxology, as a brief analysis of just three of those themes has shown. Creation as temple provides the parameters for worship of the Creator, setting the foundation for humanity’s relational role as the priest-kings of Elohim. Creation as chaos reorients that worship toward humility and wonder in the midst of a purposefully untamed and sometimes dangerous temple, bringing the wildly complex beauty of Yahweh’s creation to bear on the human experience. Finally, creation as redemption ties the entire story together, explaining the Creator’s refusal to allow Sin and Death to drag his temple back to the watery depths of non-functionality. He has chosen to create anew, to redeem every aspect of his holy temple, from its priest-kings to its wild beauties, through Jesus the Messiah, the eternal intersection of Creator, creation, and redemption. This process of new creation began at the crucifixion and resurrection, continues through the Church, and anticipates the eschaton, when Sin and Death will not only be defeated, but utterly vanquished. The holy temple will again be filled with perfect worship, forever.\nIt is because of and within this story of creation and new creation that we worship our Maker. Biblical creation theology inescapably leads to doxology.\n[1] Daniel J. Ebert, IV. \u0026ldquo;The chiastic structure of the prologue to Hebrews.\u0026rdquo; Trinity Journal 13, no. 2 (09/01, 1992): 171. Ebert also cites Gen 14:19-20; Pss 95:1-7a; 135; 136; Isa 45:17-25.\n[2] Consider the Noahic Covenant of Gen 8:1-9:17. Even God’s own judgment through the Flood, portrayed in terms of creation reversal, does not result in ultimate destruction of the created order. How much more, then, will the Creator work to redeem against the forces of his enemies, Sin and Death? See the section on “The continuation and renewal of creation” in L. H. Osborn, \u0026ldquo;Creation.\u0026rdquo; In New Dictionary of Biblical Theology, edited by T. Desmond Alexander and Brian S. Rosner.

However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God’s creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.\nYahweh’s “whirlwind speeches” in Job 38-41 are the longest sustained reflection on creation outside of Gen 1-3, and they depict a radically non-anthropocentric cosmos where the ferocity and freedom of non-human creatures is celebrated. [1] Whereas other passages seem to portray humanity as the center of God’s attention, [2] in Job 38-41 Yahweh only mentions humans in passing, choosing instead to focus on the wildest aspects of his creation, such as the Behemoth (40:15-24), the Leviathan (41:1-34), and the Sea (38:8-11).\nThe Sea, in fact, bears special mention, for it was a symbol of chaos in the ANE, and in several ANE cosmogonies it had to be slain by the gods in the process of creation. [3] Most notably, in the Babylonian Enuma Elish, the creator-goddess Tiamat (Sumerian for “salt water, deep, chaos”) is violently defeated by the warrior-god Marduk, who constructs the universe from her bloody corpse. [4] In the Genesis account, we see the cognate Hebrew term: תְּהוֹם ( tehom), the “watery depths” of Gen 1:2. Although there are echoes of the Marduk-Tiamat battle elsewhere in Scripture, [5] the struggle is not mentioned here. [6] Furthermore, in Job 38, the Sea is not a chaotic force of evil defeated by God, but a powerful force which is born as God acts as midwife. [7] Yahweh sets a boundary for the Sea, but he also gives its chaotic waters a place in the created order, revealing that his creation, though orderly, is not a perfectly safe or tame place for humans in its beauty and freedom. [8]\nThe creation theology of the whirlwind speeches shows that “humanity has a place in God’s creation…not of dominion but of humility and of wonder.” [9] The inherent chaos and complexity of creation necessitate a humble reorientation in the priest-kings’ worship of their Creator. Nevertheless, although God’s temple is wild by design, Sin and Death continue to cut against the grain of Yahweh’s creative purposes, distorting even the intrinsic beauty of creation’s chaotic aspects. All is not as it should be in Elohim’s holy temple. Creation cries out for a Redeemer.\nCONTINUE TO PART 3 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\n[1] Kathry M.

[1] It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology. Waltke summarizes the problem well: “Instead of metaphysical questions that shape culture, questions about dinosaurs, a young earth theory, and such dominate the evangelical landscape. This is unfortunate.” [2] Nevertheless, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Scripture’s use of creation themes, whether the evangelical community gives them appropriate attention or not. Unfortunately, a comprehensive analysis of biblical creation theology, a field fertile enough to provide lifetimes of work and study, far exceeds the purview of this essay. [3] However, a brief analysis of the motifs of creation as temple, chaos, and redemption will show that the overarching use of creation theology in Scripture is to bring about the praise of the Creator. Biblical creation theology, properly understood, leads to doxology.\nCREATION AS GOD’S TEMPLE A fitting place to begin this study is the creation account of Gen 1:1-2:3, which depicts the cosmos as Elohim’s holy temple. [4] Although other ancient cosmogonies prominently feature a particular location or building as the nexus for worship of the respective deities, Gen 1 contains no such element. [5] Indeed, other creation accounts in the ANE associated the lack of a temple with the “precosmic condition.” That is, creation (the expression of divine authority) was not regarded as complete until the temple (the location for the implementation of divine authority) was constructed. [6] The cosmogony of Gen 1 thus seems strange when compared to its ANE counterparts, but this anomaly reveals the main emphasis of the passage: the entire universe is the sacred dwelling place of Elohim.\nThe structure of the narrative lends itself to this “cosmic temple” interpretation. In the first three days of creation (1:1-13), Elohim calls three “spheres” into being, relating to the main “functions” of life: light/darkness (time), water/sky (weather), and land/sea (food). [7] He then proceeds to create in days four through six (1:14-31), assigning the “functionaries” of creation their respective roles and spheres. [8] The scene is then set for the climax of the narrative, which is not the creation of humans, but the installation of the Sabbath (2:1-3).\nIf the connection between this Sabbath rest and creation as temple is not apparent to the modern reader, it is due to a lack of knowledge of where divine rest takes place. [9] Upon reading that Elohim “rested” (Gen 2:2), the ancient reader would have immediately recognized that this was taking place in a divine temple, the exclusively-appropriate place for any god to rest and proceed to rule his domain from the throne. [10] However, the English “rest” does not fully reflect the meaning of the Hebrew “שָׁבַּת, shabbat,” which refers to “the completion of certain activity with which one had been occupied.” [11] After completing the creative transition from non-functional chaotic waters to a stable and functional temple, Elohim “rests,” and the cosmos may now operate normally, with him in control. [12] The clearest Scriptural compilation of all these ideas occurs in Isa 66:1-2a:\nThis is what the Lord says:\n“ The heavens are my throne and the earth is my footstool. Where then is the house you will build for me? Where is the place where I will rest? My hand made them; that is how they came to be,” says the Lord. [13]\nDoxologically, the creation of the universe as Elohim’s temple provides the impetus and parameters for appropriate worship of the Creator, whose “majestic splendor fills the entire earth” (Isa 6:3). As the only inhabitants of the cosmic temple created in the image (צֶ֫לֶם, tselem) of Elohim, humans were created to function as “priest-kings”, extending his rule and dominion throughout the entire sacred realm of creation (Gen 1:26-28). [14] Through the lens of creation as temple, therefore, worship is relational, designed to be mediated by Elohim’s beloved priest-kings as they live in perfect relationship with him, with each other, and with the rest of creation, a full vision of the divine rest appropriate to Elohim’s cosmic temple. [15]\nHowever, there is a tension between creation as it is now experienced and as it has just been described. [16] Genesis 3 gives the tragic explanation: Sin and Death, God’s cosmic enemies, have infected and affected every layer of the cosmic temple, [17] pulling the universe backwards, so to speak, toward the chaotic watery depths from which it was called into being. If the temple is no longer “safe,” is appropriate worship still possible?\nCONTINUE TO PART 2 \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\n[1] For a thoroughly cordial discussion of the debate, however, see the summary in Daniel J. Treier, \u0026ldquo;Creation.\u0026rdquo; In Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible, edited by Kevin J. Vanhoozer et al. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2005), 144.\n[2] Bruce Waltke and Charles Yu, \u0026ldquo;Chapter 7: The Gift of the Cosmos\u0026rdquo; In An Old Testament Theology: An Exegetical, Canonical, and Thematic Approach (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2007), 174.\n[3] This is by no means an exhaustive list, but each of the following abandoned section headings (due to length limitations) represents its own “fertile field” within biblical creation theology: Creation and Ethics, Creation Undone: Judgment and Exile as Creation in Reverse, Creation and Wisdom, and Creation and Ecology.\n[4] The theme of the cosmos as God’s temple is taken up at several other points in the OT. For example, consider the depictions of the heavens as a sheik’s tent stretched out for God to dwell in (Job 9:8; Ps 104:1-3; Isa 40:22; cf. 42:5; 51:13). See Waltke and Yu 2007, 205. The clearest statements, however, are found in 1 Kgs 8:27, Isa 6:3, and most especially Isa 66:1-2a (discussed below). See Walton 2009, 83-4.\nIn this section I rely heavily on Walton’s “Proposition 8: The Cosmos is a Temple,” a key piece in his “cosmic temple inauguration” view of Genesis 1. See John H. Walton, The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate (Downers Grove, IL: IVP Academic, 2009), 74-86; 162-168.\n[5] Michael W. Pahl, The Beginning and the End: Rereading Genesis\u0026rsquo;s Stories and Revelation\u0026rsquo;s Visions. (Eugene, OR: Cascade Books, 2011), 19.\n[6] Walton 2009, 78.\n[7] Ibid., 54-62. (“Proposition 5: Days One to Three in Genesis 1 Establish Functions”).\n[8] Ibid., 63-71. (“Proposition 6: Days Four to Six in Genesis 1 Install Functionaries”).\n[9] Ibid., 72-7. The pertinent information in this paragraph (other than the biblical references below) comes from Walton’s succinct and cogent argument explaining the significance of Elohim’s Sabbath rest in the “cosmic temple inauguration” view (“Proposition 7: Divine Rest Is in a Temple”).\n[10] Cf. Pss 2:4; 11:4; 14:2 (as cited by Waltke and Yu 2007, 205).\n[11] See the New English Translation’s (NET Bible) appropriate rendering of Gen 1:2b: “and he ceased on the seventh day all the work that he had been doing.”\n[12] The transition from a “ceasing rest” (שָׁבַת, shabbat) into stability can be seen in the use of the Hebrew term נ֫וּחַ ( nuha, entering stability, safety, or security) to describe God’s rest in Exodus 20:11. See Walton 2009, 73.\n[13] NET Bible, emphasis added. See Walton 2009, 83-4.\n[14] Pahl, The Beginning and the End, 19-20.\n[15] The link between divine rest and the cosmos as temple brings together several passages in the OT and NT. Consider how Heb 3:7-4:11 links the “rest” in Gen 2:2 with Ps 95. See Randall C. Gleason, \u0026ldquo;The Old Testament background of rest in Hebrews 3:7-4:11.\u0026rdquo; Bibliotheca Sacra 157, no. 627 (July 1, 2000): 281-303.\n[16] This same tension is in view in Rom 1:16-32, where Paul contrasts the righteousness of God (which he will defend through the entire epistle) with the present state of the world.\n[17] I am indebted to Dr. Timothy Gombis (Ph.D., University of St. Andrews) for this phraseology regarding Sin and Death.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/creation-and-doxology-pt-1/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eINTRODUCTION\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many conservative evangelical circles, biblical creation theology has been hijacked and eclipsed by the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism. \u003ca href=\"/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1\" title=\"\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology.

That’s right, we met in Up-Chucks the first time my freshman unit got the chance to meet our Printy sisters. It wasn’t love at first sight, but it was love pretty darn quick. Together we’ve been Getting Started Leaders, served as brother/sister RAs, worked together at summer camp, completed a marathon\u0026hellip; and now we’re lifelong partners in the pursuit of God’s grace and shalom. I don’t care if this sounds trite to some, falling in love with my girlfriend, fiancée, and now wife has been the most rewarding-yet-challenging aspect of my time here at Cedarville. I can’t wait to see how God uses us for his kingdom in the future.\nNow, I’m not saying that everyone in here has to find a husband or wife and get married during their time here at Cedarville. Furthermore, and this is especially for the underclassmen, I hope that your Cedarville experience is somehow better than mine. But could I encourage you all to do the second thing that’s made my Cedarville experience unforgettable?\nAt Cedarville I fell in love with the Gospel and learned how big God’s redemptive mission is. I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Preseminary Bible because, by God’s grace at the time I finished high school, I was sick of pretending like the Gospel was a shallow flow-chart or bullet-pointed list that could be pulled off the shelf and employed in a five-minute conversation in order to “make a new Christian.”\nI knew that something was wrong, and I wanted to devote my years at Cedarville to learning more about the Gospel in order someday to be better able to preach that good news to others. While I’ve only just begun to scratch the surface, I have learned a few important things during my time here, things that have made the Gospel all the more precious to me.\nAnd I owe many of these lessons to the godly professors who have poured into my life, (directly or indirectly), whose vision for God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive mission I have been privileged to \u0026ldquo;catch.\u0026rdquo; People like TC Ham, John White, Carl Smith, Jeff Cook, David Mills, Chris Miller, Dan Estes, Joel Williams, Tim Gombis, and Michael Pahl.\nSee it’s frighteningly easy to slice and dice the missio Dei, the mission of God, into dilapidated pieces. We want the moralistic “holiness” slice, the private piety chunk, the ticket to escape from hell-fire, the perfect precision in doctrinal orthodoxy, and the list goes on.\nNone of these are bad things, but when we act as if they’re the main thing, we fragment the Gospel, which fragments the Church, and we’re left with nothing but a shadow of the gloriously good news that, in Christ, God is reconciling the world to himself.\nThat is, God is “heading-up” all things, things on heaven and things on earth,\n\u0026hellip;the Jews and the Gentiles\n\u0026hellip;the rich and the poor\n\u0026hellip;the Regular Baptists and the Southern Baptists\n\u0026hellip;the Presbyterians and the Catholics\n\u0026hellip;the angry fundamentalists and the crazy liberals\n\u0026hellip;the black and the white\n\u0026hellip;the \u0026ldquo;have\u0026quot;s and the \u0026ldquo;have-not\u0026quot;s\n\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;them\u0026rdquo;\nALL THINGS, THINGS ON HEAVEN AND THINGS ON EARTH,\nin His Son, who has defeated Sin and Death, and whom we proclaim as King, Messiah, Savior, and Lord over the entire universe.\nThese truths can unify us, as Jesus prayed for in John 17. They can radically change the way we see God, other human beings, the universe around us, and even the way we see ourselves.\nBut they can also alter the life of the son of a bricklayer and a homemaker from Toledo, OH, who has no other reason for his unforgettable Cedarville experience than the sheer grace of God alone.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/my-unforgettable-cedarville-experience/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(The following is an expanded version of the speech I gave at this year\u0026rsquo;s CU Scholar Dessert Reception.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I ever decided about Cedarville University was that I would not, under any circumstances, attend.

But more on that later…\nRomans 3:9-20 Even though everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, is corrupt…\nDespite the fact that Sin and Death, God’s cosmic enemies, have polluted his creation…\nAlthough Scripture itself testifies that we are all unfaithful…\nAlthough the Law which was supposed to guide us in our pursuit of God has only highlighted just how broken we are and how far we have fallen…\nRomans 3:21-31 Despite all of these things, God is righteous.\nGod has revealed his covenant faithfulness to us through Jesus the Messiah, the True and Faithful Israelite through whom God has kept his redemptive promises. Through his death, the Messiah has absorbed the wrath of God which our unfaithfulness merited. What’s more, he has reconciled us to God and made possible the truly human life, one which honors God by living in perfect relationship with him and the rest of his creation. Through the Messiah, God is proving his faithfulness in redeeming the entire world.\nRomans 4:1-25 However, you’ll notice I said “made possible” above. This is because the benefits of what the Messiah has done are only appropriated to us, as they always have been, through faith. The unrepentant Jews made the mistake of assuming that their cultural identity of Torah-obedience was the source of their identity as God’s people. Not so! Look at Abraham! The righteousness of God was appropriated to him because of his faith. After all, he wasn’t even circumcised yet! Therefore, just as Abraham, we all receive the benefits of and incorporation into God’s redemptive mission through faith, and not through the Law. The key is putting our faith in the faithful Messiah.\nRomans 5:1-21 Pardon me, but this topic is so important that I’m going to run with it for awhile!\nSee, this combination of the Messiah’s faithfulness and our faith in him means that God has declared us faithful (righteous). Did you hear that? Not only is God faithful, but despite our unfaithfulness, he declares us faithful as well because of his faithful Son and our faith in him!\nThis means that we now have PEACE (and not enmity) with God!\nThis is possible because, get this, at every point at which our father Adam (and everyone ever since) failed, the Messiah has perfectly succeeded!\nBefore placing our faith in the Messiah’s faithfulness, we were all “in Adam.” That is, we were at enmity with God because of our unfaithfulness to him which deserved condemnation. However, the Messiah’s faithful obedience didn’t just undo our unrighteousness, putting us back on level ground. Instead, it has taken us to the soaring heights of God’s own righteousness! We are now “in the Messiah”!\nRomans 6:1-25 But that’s not the only transfer that’s happened! Being moved from “in Adam” to “in the Messiah” also means that we’ve been moved from the Death which Sin brings to the Life which the Messiah offers to us! While we were “in Adam,” we were slaves to Sin and Death, dominated by them and without freedom. However, now that we are “in the Messiah,” we have choices! Free choices! Sin still brings death, but we have been set free and we have the ability and opportunity to make proper choices and live life to its fullest by being truly human, giving glory to our gracious Creator!\nRomans 7:1-6 All of this has radically changed our relationship to God’s Law. Through the transfer from Adam to Messiah, from Death to Life, we have been set free from the Law’s condemnation! We can now live a life where God’s Spirit writes the Law on our hearts!\nRomans 7:7-25 See, beforehand, while we were still “in Adam,” the Law didn’t really help us out. Because of our initial unfaithfulness, the Law highlighted our brokenness and need for a Messiah Savior. It condemned us in the sight of a holy God. Although there was nothing wrong with the Law itself, there was something profoundly wrong with us, and the Law was very good at showing that!\nRomans 8:1-30 But our faith in Jesus the faithful Messiah changes things. As I mentioned above, we have now been set free from the Law’s old condemnation! The Spirit of God writes God’s law on our very heart. Not only that, the Spirit also gives us the power to live a life which is pleasing to God, in right relationship with our Creator and all of his creation. The Spirit is both our GPS and our engine. Therefore, we no longer have to worry about being condemned by the Law, because the Spirit guides and enables us to fulfill the Law’s requirements as those who are “in the Messiah.”\nRomans 8:31-39 Take a moment to think about all I have said so far. Despite the unfaithfulness of all humanity, God has proven himself faithful, most notably through his faithful Son, the Messiah. Look at all God has done for us and given to us through the Messiah! Consider the depths of his love for us! Nothing can separate us from the love of God and the love of our Messiah! God is indeed righteous. Although the plan has not yet been fully accomplished, he is well on his way toward redeeming all that he has made.\nHowever, we still haven’t covered everything. If you’ll remember, there’s still that tricky bit about the failure of God’s chosen people. Even though God has done all of this for us through the Messiah, doesn’t the failure of Israel damage his righteousness?\nCan God still be fully faithful if it appears his specific promises to/about Israel have failed?\nDespite the apparent failure of Israel, God is still righteous and faithful!\nConsider three reasons why:\nRomans 9:1-29 Firstly, if you will remember, God never promised to use every single ethnic Jew as one of his chosen people. Consider Abraham’s descendants, they were numbered through Isaac and not Ishmael. Similarly, Isaac’s descendants were numbered through Jacob and not Esau. This does not mean that God is unfair, for he is not obligated to show mercy to anyone! It also does not mean that God was eternally unloving to those he did not choose at specific times to work through in Israel’s history toward the coming of the Messiah! The main point isn’t that Ishmael and Esau were damned to hell. It’s that God has never promised to choose and use every single ethnic descendant of Abraham. It is therefore unfair to act as if God has promised to always use all physical Jews. As I alluded to before, the *true* Jews have always been so inwardly, not just outwardly.\nRomans 9:30-10:21 Secondly, let’s not blame God for what the Israelites themselves failed to do! Just because many (but not all!) Israelites have failed to have faith throughout the years does NOT mean that God is no longer faithful. Although God never promised to choose and use every ethnic Jew as one of his chosen people, all Jews did have more than enough opportunities to place their faith in God and live in faithfulness to him! However, as mentioned toward the beginning, they failed to realize the key role that faith played in the process. They boasted in their ethnic/national identity of Torah-following instead of boasting in the faithfulness of their God and fulfilling their priestly duties to the world. Please do not blame this failure on God. He has remained faithful and gracious.\nRomans 11:1-36 Thirdly, and finally, the story is not yet over! The failure/rejection of Israel is neither total nor permanent. God has always preserved a faithful remnant. That is, there has always existed, within ethnic Israel, the true Israel, the faithful people of God. Despite Israel’s failures, there has always been a remnant, graciously preserved by God to accomplish his purposes. But this remnant will not always be partial! There will come a day in the future when God will do through Israel abundantly above and beyond what he has ever done before. A complete, full generation of Israelites will someday be rescued and used by God to bless the world, completely dispelling any notions that God has somehow failed his people. Despite Israel’s faithlessness, God has remained, and will always remain, faithful and righteous.\nThis is more than even I can comprehend!\nPraise be to God!\nRomans 12 In view of God’s righteousness, his faithfulness in redeeming the world and putting it back together again through his faithful Son, the Messiah, let’s consider what it looks like to join him in his redemptive mission! If you’ll remember, our faith in the faithfulness of the Messiah is designed to bring about our own faithfulness as well!\nWhat does this faithfulness look like, in response to all God has done?\nIt starts with a refusal to conform to the world’s ways of life. Remember my mentioning of the consequences of Sin and Death earlier? Well, in addition to those things, you must also refuse to be conformed to the ways of pride and division. Instead of conformity, pursue transformation. Allow the Spirit of God to renew your mind, and it will revolutionize your relationships. Pursue things like unity, genuine love, harmony, and peace. In all circumstances, even when you are being persecuted, refuse to be overcome by evil. Instead, overcome evil with good.\nRomans 13 This all more-or-less makes sense when applied to fellow believers and neighbors, but when we start talking about persecutors and the government, things get tricky!\nThe crucial thing to remember is that, although God is in the process of invading this fallen world to establish his righteous kingdom, this does NOT mean that you should go violently overthrowing the Roman Empire, or any other empire for that matter! This is because the King we follow stands for, as I’ve just mentioned, genuine love, harmony, and peace. This rules-out violent rebellion and vengeful retaliation.\nI’m NOT arguing, by any means, that you should mindlessly participate in the currents of society and government which go against God’s kingdom. Stay alert and faithfully follow the Messiah!\nHowever, instead of trying to overthrow the Empire, you should reasonably and respectfully participate in society. Trust God’s sovereignty over human affairs by submitting to the authorities and paying your taxes. God’s kingdom will be established from the inside out!\nThese things are all related. The same characteristics of your love for each other and for your neighbors should be applied to persecutors and the governing authorities. If “in Adam,” then this stuff sounds ridiculous. However, we are “in the Messiah,” and this radically changes everything. Let us live in LOVE, the fulfillment of God’s law, as we await our Messiah’s return…\nRomans 14-15 …which brings me to the most pressing issue I wish to address.\nSee, all of this means very little if it does not impact how you Jews and Gentiles relate to each other within the body of the Messiah, the Church. Now that you are both accepted as full members of God’s holy people, I realize that there has been quite a bit of social tension created, specifically with regards to food! While I could give you an apostolically-prescribed menu, that would defeat the purpose, because my main goal (and God’s main goal, for that matter) in this is to see you unified, harmoniously working together as Jews and Gentiles for God’s kingdom.\nHere’s why this is important. If you allow something as simple and amoral as food to fragment you, think of what a slap in the face that is to the Messiah, who moved heaven and earth to defeat Sin and Death and reconcile you all to God.\nSin and Death destroy relationships.\nOur Messiah destroyed Sin and Death.\nIf you, then, go back and destroy relationships over things such as food, you are effectively undoing the work of the Messiah.\nDo not let this be so! Overwhelm each other with grace and love as you pursue unity!\nUse these principles within the body to settle all further and future differences as well, for your unity and love for one another prove that God’s mission is working in the world!\nRomans 16 I am confident that God has been and will continue to be at work in your lives. Deeply consider the things I have said to you. But take heart, for we serve a God who loves human beings, and that is why he has chosen to use us in his redemptive mission!\nJust don’t forfeit this precious role by allowing people to cause dissensions among you!\nI have now come full circle in my argument.\nDespite our failures, God is righteous in his mission of redeeming the world through his Son, the Messiah, and through his people, the Church, of which you are a part.\nHis faithfulness to us through the Messiah is designed to bring about (through our faith in him) our own faithfulness and obedience to him.\nMay our righteous God and our faithful Messiah be praised and given glory forever!\nAmen!\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/romans-distilled-paraphrased/","summary":"The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul\u0026rsquo;s Epistle to the Romans.\nRomans 1:1-17 If you don’t catch anything else from what I’m about to say, remember this:\nGod is righteous.

But when the topic has been addressed in the past, it\u0026rsquo;s amounted to little more than being nice to my friends\u0026hellip;people who are already likely to be remarkably similar to me, people already within the little camp of Christianity in which I have grown-up.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s never been encouraged to spread to other Christian \u0026ldquo;camps.\u0026rdquo; Forget the Pentecostals, Anglicans, Methodists, Catholics, Presbyterians, etc. If the pastor\u0026rsquo;s feeling a bit edgy, we can partner with them on service projects, but unless the \u0026ldquo;others\u0026rdquo; get their act together, they are to be tolerated at best, and at worst ridiculed.\nInstead, in my particular stream of Christianity, the focus has been placed on two things: doctrinal orthodoxy and moral purity.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t hear me wrongly, I am not denying the importance of either of these two things. God is meant to be known well, and to do that we must think, talk, teach, and speak about him well. Theology is not to be a shoddy enterprise, and we must constantly examine ourselves, aware of the shortcomings of our humanness, in the pursuit of understanding of Yahweh. Furthermore, Yahweh is a holy God. He hates Sin and Death, and if we are serious about following him, we must hate Sin and Death as well.\nChrist calls us to live Genesis 1-2 lives in a Genesis 3 world.\nBut, wait a second. Go back and read that again. \u0026ldquo;Christ calls us to live Genesis 1-2 lives in a Genesis 3 world.\u0026rdquo; What popped into your head as you read that sentence? What should characterize that Genesis 1-2 kind of life?\nI fear that, if you\u0026rsquo;ve inherited the same stream of Christianity that I have, unity and interpersonal relationships were not the first things to color your vision of what Genesis 1-2 would look like today. Instead, we (conservative evangelical North American Christians) are much more likely to think of living a morally spotless life driven by a flawless theology. With no sin to fetter us and lead us toward doctrinal laxity, we would be free to enjoy God forever.\nWe have flattened Christianity by focusing on these things at the expense of focusing on the rich vision of community and unity that we find in the pages of Scripture. Read Genesis 1-2. We were created to enjoy God, yes. We were created to live without sin, yes. But we were created to enjoy and be enjoyed by each other. We were made to know and be known. God\u0026rsquo;s perfect shalom included much more than moral purity and doctrinal orthodoxy. It included perfect relationships: with God, with each other, with our own \u0026ldquo;self\u0026quot;s, and with all of creation.\nAnd likewise, the Fall of Genesis 3 broke relationships. It separated us from God, estranged us from each other, introduced discord within our own psyches, and infected the creation in which we dwell. Sin and Death were unleashed into the cosmos, and they have polluted and twisted every layer.\nThe call back to Genesis 1-2 therefore involves much more than right doctrine and moral purity. God is in the process of redeeming everything. And every time we cut his redemptive mission in half (or sometimes smaller), we do so at our own peril.\n\u0026hellip;toward the administration of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ – the things in heaven and the things on earth.(Ephesians 1:10 NET)\nI believe that God\u0026rsquo;s heart breaks over the lack of unity in his Church today. Is he pleased with the individual moral sins we love to emphasize? By no means. Is he pleased with bad theology? No way. But something is seriously amiss if we do not think that God\u0026rsquo;s heart breaks over the fragmentation within the Body of Christ.\nWhat do you think about this issue?

Listen to his intro:\nThis post probably has something to make everyone unhappy. But here goes.\nWith Memorial Day on Monday (in the U.S.) and, no doubt, a number of patriotic services scheduled for this Sunday, I want to offer a few theses on patriotism and the church. Each of these points could be substantially expanded and beg more detailed defense and explanation, but since this is a blog and not a term paper, I’ll try to keep this under 1500 words.\nDeYoung goes on to cover five main points:\nBeing a Christian does not remove national and ethnic identities. Patriotism, like other earthly “prides,” can be a virtue or vice. Allegiance to God and allegiance to your country are not inherently incompatible. God’s people are not tied to any one nation. All this leads to one final point: while patriotism can be good, the church is not a good place for patriotism. Overall, I really appreciate this attempt to arrive at a balance between those who simply baptize their American patriotism and call it Christianity and those who view every instance of patriotism as damnable idolatry. I loved DeYoung\u0026rsquo;s last paragraph:\nIn some parts of the church, every hint of patriotism makes you a jingoistic idolater. You are allowed to love every country except your own. But in other parts of the church, true religion blends too comfortably into civil religion. You are allowed to worship in our services as long as you love America as much as we do. I don’t claim to have arrived at the golden mean, but I imagine many churches could stand to think more carefully about their theology of God and country. Churches should be glad to have their members celebrate Memorial Day with gusto this Monday. We should be less sanguine about celebrating it with pomp and circumstance on Sunday.\nIn the end, while I want to avoid the extreme position of viewing every form of patriotism as idolatry, I think that American Christians too often give unthinking allegiance and support to the country in which we live. Without demonizing the country in which we live, the amazing freedoms which we are able to enjoy, and the men and women who have sacrificed to secure and preserve those freedoms for us, we need to always remember that we, if we belong to Christ, are ultimately citizens of a greater Kingdom than the United States of America. DeYoung has this to say about the compatibility of allegiance to God and allegiance to one\u0026rsquo;s country:\nIf you read all that the New Testament says about governing authorities in places like Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2, you see that the normal situation is one of compatible loyalties. The church is not the state and the state is not God, but this does not mean the church must always be against the state. In general, then, it’s possible to be a good Christian and a good American, or a good Ghanaian or a good Korean. Patriotism is not bad. Singing your national anthem and getting choked up is not bad. Allegiance to God and allegiance to your country do not have to be at odds.\nCorrect, allegiance to God and allegiance to country do not have to be diametrically opposed. Christians should live as respectful citizens of their respective nations. However, do we really believe that Ghanaian and Korean Christians are every bit as good as American ones? I know everyone\u0026rsquo;s going to say \u0026ldquo;yes,\u0026rdquo; but do we really believe this? What if those Ghanaian and/or Korean Christians don\u0026rsquo;t like the United States of America? Are they still as pleasing to God in our eyes, or does their righteousness depend on their support of the Red, White, and Blue? Because a lot of what I have seen/heard/experienced in the American church seems to subtly teach that our country is the best and most deserving of God\u0026rsquo;s favor. I retweeted the following recently:\nI’m waiting for the Iranian and N. Korean editions of the Patriot’s Bible. http://www.americanpatriotsbible.com.\nWhy does something like this have the potential to upset so many American Christians? \u0026ldquo;Iran and North Korea are clearly more morally evil than the United States,\u0026rdquo; some will say. Maybe so, but since when does our country get to claim the right of being God-approved? Can Christians in Ghana sing \u0026ldquo;God bless Ghana\u0026rdquo;? Perhaps our reactions to tweets/messages/statements like the one above only prove the problem.\nBefore someone calls me a heretic or an anti-American, please know that simply questioning the American church\u0026rsquo;s commitment to the USA does NOT immediately make me into someone who burns flags and pickets soldiers funerals. That would be swinging to the other end of the spectrum, and I do not believe that such a dichotomy exists. If someone does not give unquestioning allegiance to the USA, it does not mean that they automatically align themselves with the crazies over at Westboro Baptist Church.\nI am a Christian.\nI am also an American citizen. I obey the law, salute the flag, am respectful of the men and women in the armed forces, grateful for their sacrifices, and thankful for the fact that I live in a country where I can enjoy unparalleled freedoms (such as writing blog posts like this without having to fear for my life).\n\u0026hellip;but I do not give my ultimate allegiance to the American flag, or any other national standard for that matter. I pledge my ultimate allegiance to Jesus the Messiah. And while most Christians in the United States of America would nod their heads and agree with that previous statement, I think that we all need to consider whether we are living it out or not. Will our church services on Memorial Day reflect this?\nMay our eternal and infinite God bless his global bride, his global people, his global Church as Christians from every tribe, tongue, nation, and language follow their true King, Jesus the Messiah.\n~Josh.\n","permalink":"https://joshuapsteele.github.io/church_and_state/","summary":"(Note: for a more recent piece on the relationship between Church and State, see my essay: \u0026quot; Improvising Church and State.\u0026quot;)\nI just read an article by Kevin DeYoung at The Gospel Coalition: \u0026ldquo;Thinking Theologically About Memorial Day\u0026rdquo;.

It can be found in abundance in the urban centers of this country, and in countless other places around the globe.\nModern day slavery “more cruel than any beast of prey” (Wright 2005, 136), it traps human beings created in the image of God in a lifestyle of hunger, sickness, anger, and darkness.\nHowever, one can effortlessly go through daily life in middle class America without giving much thought or care to the billions of people living in poverty worldwide. Furthermore, one can even profess faith in Jesus Christ and regularly attend an average evangelical church in the United States without being prompted to pay the poor, underprivileged, and oppressed of this world any mind.\nIn this milieu of wealth and poverty existing side by side in an atmosphere of confusion and apathy, the book of Proverbs provides relevant insights into the nature of poverty, the nature of Yahweh, and how his people should respond to it.\n(For more on how Christians should think about poverty and wealth, see my essay \u0026ldquo;Christians and Wealth.\u0026rdquo;)\nDescriptions of Poverty: Effects and Causes Many proverbs are devoted to describing the harsh realities of poverty, showing that the Hebrew sages were well aware of its existence and characteristics.\nEffects These proverbs frequently describe the poor in direct contrast to the wealthy. Consider Proverbs 10:15:\n“A rich man’s wealth is in his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin.\u0026quot;\nThe force of the antithetical parallelism of this verse is hard to overlook. Whybray explains that the main point “is that wealth protects the rich from the vicissitudes of life, while the poor, having no resources to fall back on, are easily vulnerable to total disaster” (1994, 165).\nThe word used for “poor” here is dal. While Whybray states that this word is synonymous with the other Hebrew terms for “poor” ( ˓ānı̂, ˒ebyôn, and rāš)in Proverbs (1994, 165), The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament (TWOT) differentiates dal from the other three, saying that “unlike ˓ānı̂, dal does not emphasize pain or oppression; unlike ˒ebyôn, it does not primarily emphasize need, and unlike rāš, it represents those who lack rather than the destitute.” Dal refers to the lack of both material and social resources (Harris, et al. 1999).\nThis lack of social resources can be seen in the proverbs that describe how poverty affects relationships. Proverbs 14:20 says that\n“The poor is disliked even by his neighbor, but the rich has many friends.”\nThis same theme is reiterated in chapter 19:\n“Wealth brings many new friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend” (19:4).\nExpanded across two verses, it reads:\n“Many seek the favor of a generous man, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. All a poor man’s brothers hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him!” (19:6-7a).\nThese three proverbs contrast the social standings of the wealthy and the impoverished. Alden’s comment on 14:20 is apt when he says that “the unfortunate truth [is] that greed is a more compelling trait than generosity; people are more eager to have rich friends than poor ones” (1983, 114).\nProverbs 19:6-7a expands upon this, describing how people are naturally drawn to relationships that give them material benefit. It is rare, however, to find people who are drawn to relationships that would cost them materially. Even a poor man’s family members “hate him”!\nBridges says it well:\n“As the winter brooks, filled from the opening springs and the torrents from heaven, are dried up and vanish before the summer heat; so these friends of the poor go far from him, cold, distant, and vanishing in the day of his calamity” (1987, cf. 1846, 312).\nMaterially and socially, poverty wreaks havoc on the lives of those it entraps.\nCauses Given the terrible effects and characteristics of poverty, Proverbs naturally contains many admonitions to avoid its causes.\nCauses of poverty listed in Proverbs include (but are not limited to):\na “slack hand” (laziness) (10:4), ignorance of instruction (13:18), endless talk (without toil/labor) (14:23), hastiness (21:15), the love of pleasure (21:17), drunkenness and gluttony (23:21), worthless pursuits (28:19), and stinginess (28:22). Of particular interest is the repetition of the warning against excessive slumber if one is to avoid poverty (6:10-11; 20:13; 23:21; 24:33-34).\nProverbs 6:10-11 and 24:33-34 include the almost verbatim admonition:\n“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.”\nSleep (as compared with labor) might give the initial benefits of rest and relaxation, but when developed into an excessive habit, it can have disastrous consequences.\nJohn Chrysostom comments upon 6:11:\n“Is work at first difficult? Then look to its results. Is idleness sweet? Then consider what comes out of it in the end. So let us look not at the beginning of things, but let us also see where they end up” (Wright 2005, 50).\nThis approach perhaps summarizes most of the practical warnings in Proverbs about avoiding poverty. What initially seems like the easiest and most comfortable choice will rarely, if ever, lead to success.\nSet apart from the practical warnings of avoiding poverty, however, is Proverbs 22:16:\n“Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.”\nThe verb “oppress” here is the term ˓ā∙šǎq, meaning “mistreat, i.e., treat a disadvantaged member of society unjustly with the effect of causing one to suffer ill-treatment” (Swanson 1997).\nAlthough the Hebrew of this verse is quite difficult and there is little concurrence among commentators as to its proper interpretation (Whybray 1994, 322-323), the sense of it seems to be that the end result of oppressing the impoverished for material gain is only further poverty.\nProverbs 30:14 comes to mind:\n“There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.”\nThese verses make the transition from descriptions of poverty to responses to its existence, highlighting the uncomfortable truth that improper treatment of the poor can bring disaster.\nResponses to Poverty: Yahweh and the Poor It is clear that Proverbs gives its readers a thorough understanding of the dreadfulness of poverty and the importance of avoiding it.\nHowever, this understanding does little to inform the audience of how we should respond to the existence of poverty.\nThe surest foundation for a proper response to poverty is undoubtedly the character of Yahweh with regards to the oppressed and impoverished.\nConsider Proverbs 14:31:\n“Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him.”\nThe first line of this proverb is echoed in 17:5a, and the second (seemingly unrelated) line of 17:5, “he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished,” has been taken by some commentators to refer to those who rejoice over not just calamity in general, but specifically the ruin of the poor (Whybray 1994, 255 and Clifford 1999, 164).\nIf this is the case, then these two proverbs taken together make the same point with both a positive promise and a negative warning. Clifford states the main point particularly well:\n“The dignity of each human being comes from being created by God. Contempt towards anyone insults the person’s maker. The example of the poor person, the type perhaps least likely to gain respect, is used to dramatize the point. Every human being, irrespective of wealth, is worthy of respect” (1999, 164).\nThe same point is made in Proverbs 22:2, which states:\n“The rich and the poor meet together; the Lord is the maker of them all,”\nand also in 29:13:\n“The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.”\nOur treatment of the poor needs to be based upon the fact that they have been made in the image of Yahweh and are therefore worthy of dignity and respect. To deny them the treatment that each and every human being deserves is not just stinginess, it is an insult and an offense to the Creator.\nHowever, Proverbs goes further than appeals to imago Dei in its teachings about our treatment of the poor.\nAtkinson says it well:\n“The oppression of the poor is both a violation of someone who should be respected because he or she bears the image of the Creator, and also an attitude which does not reflect the character of the Creator, who is himself on the side of the poor” (1996, 111).\nProverbs 22:22-23 delivers a stunningly vivid warning:\n“Do not rob the poor, because he is poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate, for the LORD will plead their cause and rob of life those who rob them.”\nThe reader is told to not take justice from the poor because they have the LORD as their defender at the gate (the site of legal proceedings). “The poor, by not having human protectors, have Yahweh as their protector. Paradoxically, their poverty gives them a more powerful protector than the rich could afford” (Clifford 1999, 207).\nThis gives a glimpse into a thematic truth of Scripture that has been called God’s “bias to the poor.” Atkinson quotes Karl Barth to further explain:\n“The human righteousness required by God and established in obedience – the righteousness which according to Amos 5:24 should pour down as a mighty stream – has necessarily the character of a vindication of right in favour of the threatened innocent, the oppressed poor, widows, orphans, and aliens.\nFor this reason, in the relations and events in the life of his people, God always takes his stand unconditionally and passionately on this side and this side alone: against the lofty and on behalf of the lowly; against those who enjoy right and privilege and on behalf of those who are denied it and deprived of it” (1996, 111-112, cf. Barth, Church Dogmatics II/1 [T.\u0026amp;T. Clark, 1957], p. 387)\nGod’s heart for and even bias toward the poor extends well beyond the book of Proverbs. If one pays close attention, it is readily apparent that Scripture is saturated with it.\nYahweh intervened to save his people from the oppression and poverty they suffered in at the hands of the Egyptians (cf. Exodus 3:7-9). He made his frustration at his people’s improper treatment and distortion of the impoverished and the needy known through the prophets (cf. Isaiah 10:1-3; Jeremiah 5:26-29; 7:5-7; Amos 2:7; 4:1; 5:10-15; 6:4-7; Micah 2:2). Jesus the Messiah cited his own mission as one that was inextricably tied to the poor and oppressed (cf. Luke 4:16-21). The final judgment will be executed (at least partially so) with regards to the treatment (or mistreatment) of the poor and the needy (cf. Matthew 25:31-46). Scripture makes it abundantly clear that God’s heart is for the impoverished, destitute, and oppressed.\nIt is important to establish this truth well in order to rightly proceed in our actions and attitudes toward the poor and the oppressed. This is because it is entirely too easy to think of God’s actions and attitudes as being most closely aligned with people who are just like us.\nHowever, for the vast majority of Christians in the United States who live life in relatively extravagant comfort and ease, it comes as somewhat of a shock that God’s bias might actually be against us if we do not take this issue seriously!\nProverbs reflects that what is at stake here is much more than just our consciences, the minor twangs of guilt or moments of self-righteousness we too often experience in our infrequent interactions with the poor.\nResponses to Poverty: Consequences and Rewards The teachings in Proverbs regarding the treatment of the poor can be divided into three categories:\nthose that display negative consequences for improper treatment, those that display positive rewards for proper treatment, and those that juxtapose the two. Negative Consequences Proverbs 21:13 states:\n“Whoever closes his ears to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.”\nThe frightening reciprocity of this verse hits hard when, in our culture, we are too often distracted by other things which are “more important” than attending to the needs of the poor. When we find ourselves in a moment of dire need, how can we expect to be answered if we have not answered the needy when we were able to do so?\nAnother warning against mistreating the poor that includes a form of retribution against the offender is Proverbs 28:8:\n“Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit gathers is for him who is generous to the poor.”\nWhybray claims that the word for “interest” refers to “interest which was levied by deduction from the original loan but which had to be repaid in full,” and that “profit” refers to “an additional charge levied on repayment” (1994, 391).\nThe point is that money taken from the poor will not do its wicked owner any good, and has the potential to end up in the hands of righteous men which will in turn help to meet the needs of the poor.\nPositive Rewards In addition, Proverbs contains several verses that positively portray, and thereby encourage, generosity towards the poor and preservation of their justice.\nConsider Proverbs 19:17:\n“Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed.”\nThis proverb promises a reward to those who treat the poor with generosity. However, the main point is not to treat them with benevolence out of desire for a reward.\nWhybray captures the point well:\n“there is no idea here of a quid pro quo: no intention to encourage generosity simply for the reward which it will bring. The underlying thought is that generosity is characteristic of a person who is righteous; and the proverb reflects the basic belief that righteousness is, and ought to be, materially rewarded” (1994, 282).\nA virtually identical point is made in Proverbs 22:9:\n“Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.”\nFurthermore, the well-known wise woman discussed in chapter 31 “opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy” (31:20). Giving generously to the poor is a mark of a righteous person, one whose life will be blessed by Yahweh.\nCombinations Finally, some proverbs combine the negative and positive aspects of the previously mentioned verses through antithetical parallelism.\nA prime example is Proverbs 14:21:\n“Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner, but blessed is he who is generous to the poor.”\nThis verse highlights the benefits of generosity against the backdrop of the consequences of scorning one’s neighbor.\nIn a similar fashion, Proverbs 28:27 says that\n“whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse.”\nWhether or not the curses come from the poor who have been denied assistance, or from Yahweh himself, the point remains that there are rewards in caring for the impoverished and consequences for not doing so.\nIn addition to generosity, however, the Hebrew sages also expressed concern for the justice of the poor.\nProverbs 29:7 makes it clear that\n“a righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.”\nThe importance of justice for the poor is also stated later in the chapter in verse 14:\n“If a king faithfully judges the poor, his throne will be established forever.”\nGiven Yahweh’s “bias” toward the poor and their status as his image bearers, it would do one well to be concerned with their legal rights.\nIt is not enough to simply not oppress the poor. Proverbs, along with the rest of Scripture, seems to mandate advocating for their justice.\nConclusion In our current context of extravagant wealth and abject poverty existing side by side in a realm of confusion, apathy, and even malice towards the impoverished, Proverbs contains some timely and powerful teaching.\nThe Hebrew sages had a firm grasp on both the tempting causes and terrible effects of poverty. They, therefore, put a strong emphasis on avoiding it at all costs through diligence and hard work.\nHowever, this did not lead them to abandon a proper view towards the poor, and they grounded all of their teachings about the proper treatment of the poor in the unchanging and perfect character of Yahweh, who is firmly committed to their protection and justice.\nThe modern readers of this ancient book would do well to heed its teachings regarding poverty, and to proceed with attitudes and actions in imitation of Yahweh in their interactions with and opinions of the poor, destitute, and oppressed of this world.\nBibliography Alden, Robert L.
