    <meta name="description" content="I’m happy to announce that Rachel and I will be completing my required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum for Beeson Divinity School along with our good friends Kyle, Rebekah, and baby Luke DeBoer in Lima, Peru this summer!
Our goal is to assist the Stone families (Dave &amp; Evelyn; Jonathan &amp; Angela) in their various local ministries, including:

Seminario Teológico Bautista (Seminary)
Luz del Camino Iglesia (Church)
Vida Nueva Centro Prenatal (Pregnancy Center)

The goal of Beeson’s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to “expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting.” In addition to fulfilling this goal, we believe that this trip to Peru will be influential in determining the future involvement of both our families in global missions. God’s given each of us unique gifts — ranging from medicine to math, theology to linguistics. But He’s blessed us all with a heart for His global Gospel and his global Church.">

<p>Our goal is to assist <a href="http://www.abweperu.org/page_family/pagefamily.php?id=12">the Stone families</a> (Dave &amp; Evelyn; Jonathan &amp; Angela) in their various local ministries, including:</p>

</ul>
<p>The goal of Beeson’s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to “<em>expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting</em>.” In addition to fulfilling this goal, we believe that this trip to Peru will be <strong>influential in determining the future involvement of both our families in global missions</strong>. God’s given each of us unique gifts — ranging from medicine to math, theology to linguistics. But <strong>He’s blessed us all with a heart for His global Gospel and his global Church</strong>.</p>
<p>Frankly, we realize that <strong>we have much more to learn than to offer! But we’re excited to learn valuable lessons in Lima. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Would you please pray for us as we prepare for this trip?</span></strong></p>
<p>Finally, if you’re interested in partnering with us financially to make this trip a reality, please visit <a href="http://www.youcaring.com/mission-trip-fundraiser/peru-or-bust-deboer-and-steele/147648">our YouCaring.Com page. </a></p>
