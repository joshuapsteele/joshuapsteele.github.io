Opening Prayer
God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:

promote your justice
embody your steadfast faithful love
and humbly obey Your will,

even if it costs us our reputations, and even if it costs us our lives.
I ask that this transformation would begin with me. In Jesus’ name. Amen.">

<h2 id="opening-prayer">Opening Prayer</h2>
<p>God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would move in our lives, so that we would:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote your <strong>justice</strong></li>
<li>embody your <strong>steadfast faithful love</strong></li>
<li>and <strong>humbly</strong> obey Your will,</li>
</ul>
<p>even if it costs us our <em>reputations</em>, and even if it costs us our <em>lives</em>.</p>
<p>I ask that this transformation would begin with <strong>me</strong>. In Jesus’ name. <em>Amen</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’d like to start off with a very basic question: <strong>Do you want to get ahead in life?</strong></p>
<p>Do you want things to get better? Do you want your life, and your children’s lives, to improve?</p>
<p>I mean, despite the many things that divide us humans, don’t we all want progress? When it comes right down to it, don’t we all just want to get ahead?</p>
<p><em><strong>I know I do.</strong></em></p>
<p>In fact, as the students in our youth group could tell you, this is one of the reasons why I love “life hacks”!</p>
<p>Have you heard of life hacks? They’re these little tips and tricks to get ahead in life while saving time, money, and effort.</p>
<p>Like, one of my favorite life hacks is the “coffee nap.” You drink a cup of coffee, then immediately take a 20-minute nap, so that the caffeine kicks in right as you wake up.</p>
<p>Life hack. Try it sometime. Thank me later.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS, we all want to get ahead in life. Right?</p>
<p>But there’s a problem: How do we know what <em>getting ahead</em> looks like?</p>
<p>I mean, think about it. Getting ahead can look quite different in different contexts. Right?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is too crude of an example for a sermon, but getting ahead in a drinking game looks totally different than getting ahead in Alcoholics Anonymous!</p>
<p>Getting ahead in the NBA Finals hopefully looks different than getting ahead in playing basketball with your kids.</p>
<p>Getting ahead on Wall Street as a day-trader hopefully looks different than getting ahead in running a charity.</p>
<p>In order to get ahead,</p>
<ul>
<li>you have to know the <strong>context</strong>,</li>
<li>you have to know the <strong>rules</strong>,</li>
<li>you have to know the <strong>goal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, no matter how hard you try, you’re not really going to get ahead. You’ll just be getting ahead at the wrong thing. Which means you’ll fail.</p>
<p>So here’s the kicker: <strong>Getting ahead in God’s eyes looks a whole lot different than getting ahead in the world’s eyes.</strong></p>
<p>The world is a different context. The world follows different rules. And the world has a different goal than God’s Kingdom.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-point">The Main Point</h2>
<p>In fact, and here’s my main point if you want to write it down:</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foolish</span> in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<h2 id="gods-upside-down-kingdom--1-corinthians-118-31">God’s Upside-Down Kingdom – 1 Corinthians 1:18-31</h2>
<p>Now, this is the message of all of our readings for today, but I’d like to start with the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:18. (You can find it on page 952 in your pew Bible.)</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 1:18 says:</p>
<p><em><strong>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing</strong></em> (that’s what I’m calling “the world,” by the way – those who are perishing), <em><strong>but to us who are being saved</strong></em> (that is, to us who are a part of God’s Kingdom) <em><strong>it is the power of God.</strong></em></p>
<p>You see, <strong><u>God’s not against getting ahead</u></strong>. In fact, you could even say that God is on a mission to “Make Creation Great Again”!</p>
<p>I’m not kidding! He made it great in the first place – a perfect universe with perfect relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation.</p>
<p>However, ever since we humans rebelled against God – ever since Sin shattered the relationships between God, humanity, and all of creation – God has been on a mission to put everything back together again.</p>
<p>Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>So why is Paul saying that the good news of God’s rescue mission is <em><strong>foolishness</strong></em> to the world?</p>
<p>Because God makes creation great again in a totally unexpected way!</p>
<p><strong>This is what I mean by “<u>God’s upside-down kingdom</u>.”</strong></p>
<p>In order to make the world right again, God shows up and <strong>reverses</strong> the ways the world has gotten used to working. And the greatest reversal of all in God’s upside-down kingdom is when <strong>the eternal Son of God becomes <u>human</u> and gets himself <u>killed</u> for the sins of the entire world.</strong></p>
<p>The world expects</p>
<ul>
<li>power,</li>
<li>might,</li>
<li>strength,</li>
<li>and victory,</li>
</ul>
<p>and we receive instead a</p>
<ul>
<li>naked,</li>
<li>abandoned</li>
<li>Middle-Eastern man,</li>
<li>brutally executed</li>
<li>as a political criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>We receive a <em><strong>bloody example</strong></em> for those who would dare challenge the kingdoms of this world.</p>
<p>We receive a <em><strong>Crucified</strong></em> <em><strong>Savior</strong></em>. And the world calls that absolutely <em><strong><u>RIDICULOUS</u></strong></em>.</p>
<p>Because, to the world, you don’t get ahead by <strong>laying your life down</strong> (like Jesus did). You get ahead by <em><u>taking what’s yours</u></em>.</p>
<p>You don’t get ahead by <strong>hanging out with the wrong crowd</strong> (like Jesus did). You’re supposed to <em><u>rub shoulders with the rich and the famous</u></em>, not the <strong>poor</strong> and the <strong>homeless</strong>.</p>
<p>You’re not supposed to <strong>focus on the people at the bottom and at the border</strong> (like Jesus did)!</p>
<p>For crying out loud, you’re supposed to get out there and <em><u>hustle</u></em>!</p>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Climb the ladder! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Make deals! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Take no prisoners! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Make demands! </u></em></li>
<li><em><u>Get ahead!</u></em></li>
</ul>
<p>…And get right back where we need to be saved <em><strong><u>FROM</u></strong></em>!</p>
<p><em><strong>That’s where the world’s ways get us.</strong></em></p>
<p>Where every human is</p>
<ul>
<li>an egotistical island,</li>
<li>competing with God,</li>
<li>alienating other humans,</li>
<li>and abusing creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, as Paul tells us in <strong>[<u>1 Cor 1:25</u>]</strong>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God saves us through what looks like foolishness and weakness.</p>
<p>Why? So that we would not boast in our pathetic “wisdom” and “strength.”</p>
<p>Instead, we are to boast only in the true wisdom and strength of God.</p>
<p>Paul continues in <strong>[<u>1 Cor. 1:27</u>]</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But God chose what is <u>foolish</u> in the world to shame the <u>wise</u>; God chose what is <u>weak</u> in the world to shame the <u>strong</u>; <sup>28 </sup>God chose what is <u>low</u> and <u>despised</u> in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, <sup>29 </sup>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, then, is the <strong>upside-down Kingdom of God</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="blessed-are-the-losers--matthew-51-12">Blessed are the “Losers” – Matthew 5:1-12</h2>
<p>And it’s the exact same Kingdom that we find in the Beatitudes of Matthew 5.</p>
<p>(FYI: We call them the “Beatitudes” because of the Latin word for “blessed/happy” – <em>beatus</em>.)</p>
<p>Now, remember: <strong>God isn’t against getting ahead. He really does want what’s <u>best</u> for us.</strong></p>
<p>But the danger is that we’ll try to get ahead on our own, in our own way. And if we do that, <strong><u>we’ll miss the point in at least two ways. </u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First, we won’t realize that <strong>we desperately need a Savior</strong>, and that <strong>we cannot save ourselves</strong>.</li>
<li>Second, we will <strong>ignore</strong> the very <strong>people</strong> that God wants us to <strong>care for</strong> in order to really get ahead in his Kingdom!</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on our own</span>, we’re going to focus on those at the <strong>center</strong> and <strong>height</strong> of <strong>power</strong>. You know, “The Winners.”</p>
<p>But <u>God focuses</u> on those at the <strong>bottom</strong> and at the <strong>borders</strong>, the <strong>edges</strong> of society. You know, “The Losers.”</p>
<p><em>These</em> are the people who will experience God’s favor in his Upside-Down Kingdom. Take a look at [<strong><u>Matthew 5:3-12</u></strong>].</p>
<p>Notice how Jesus declares God’s favor, His blessing, to what the world would call the “wrong kind of people.”</p>
<ul>
<li>To the <strong>poor</strong> in spirit</li>
<li>Those who <strong>mourn</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>meek</strong></li>
<li>Those who <strong>hunger</strong> and thirst for righteousness</li>
<li>The <strong>merciful</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>pure</strong> in heart</li>
<li>The <strong>peacemakers</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>persecuted</strong></li>
<li>And the <strong>reviled</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And notice as well, that the blessings frequently involve <strong>reversals</strong>. The world is giving them one thing, but God is going to give them another.</p>
<p>Now, this is important: these famous words are a <strong><u>mixture</u></strong> of <strong>encouragement</strong> and <strong>instruction</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, Jesus isn’t just giving us a TO-DO LIST in order to get as much blessing as possible. He’s not saying “Go out there and try harder to be poor, persecuted, hungry, mourners.”</p>
<p>Now, Jesus IS <strong>instructing</strong>, more on that in a second. <strong>But</strong> he is first offering divine <strong>encouragement</strong> to those who are <em><strong><u>already</u></strong></em> in those situations.</p>
<h2 id="the-beatitudes-an-interpretive-translation">The Beatitudes: An Interpretive Translation</h2>
<p>Here’s my interpretive translation of the Beatitudes. Follow along with each one if you’ve got a Bible in front of you.</p>
<p>Jesus is saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) “Take heart! Things aren’t what they seem! If you <strong>lack resources</strong> and realize that God alone can save you, then you might not feel like a part of the Roman kingdom. But <strong>you’re a part of God’s Kingdom</strong>.”</li>
<li>(2) “Be encouraged! If you <strong>bear</strong> and <strong>grieve</strong> the <strong>sufferings</strong> of the world, then the kings of the world probably won’t give you much <strong>comfort</strong>. <strong>But God, your true King, will.</strong></li>
<li>(3) Take heart! If you <strong>humbly</strong> and <strong>gently</strong> <strong>refuse</strong> to seek <strong>vengeance</strong> or <strong>power</strong>, then you probably won’t inherit much from the world’s kingdoms. <strong>But God will give you an inheritance in His Kingdom</strong>.</li>
<li>(4) Be encouraged! If you <strong>pursue God’s will above all else</strong>, then you’ll probably go <strong>hungry</strong> in this world. But you will be <strong>satisfied</strong> in God’s Kingdom, where His <strong>will</strong> is <strong>obeyed</strong>.</li>
<li>(5) Take heart! If you show <strong>mercy</strong> and <strong>compassion</strong> to a suffering world, you might not receive much mercy back! <strong>But you yourselves will be shown mercy by God.</strong></li>
<li>(6) Be encouraged! If you <strong>single-mindedly</strong> pursue God’s will, then you probably won’t experience the world’s glory. <strong>But</strong> <strong>you will experience God’s glory and presence.</strong></li>
<li>(7) Take heart! If you <strong>pursue</strong> <strong>reconciliation</strong> and <strong>reject violence</strong>, then you probably won’t reflect the character of this world. <strong>But you will reflect the character of God.</strong></li>
<li>(8) Take heart! Because when this world <strong>rejects</strong> you, <strong>insults</strong> you, <strong>lies</strong> about you, and <strong>persecutes</strong> you, then it may not look like it, <strong>but you’re in good company! You’re in the company of your Savior, Jesus Christ.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Friends, if you’re here today and you’re at the bottom of this world, then I <strong>encourage</strong> you to <strong>cling</strong> to the divine <strong>promises</strong> of <strong>blessing</strong> in the Beatitudes.</p>
<p>God is in the process of making all things new – <strong>reversing</strong> every wrong in this world. <em><strong><u>Take heart.</u></strong></em></p>
<p>However, and perhaps this is uncomfortable to talk about, <strong>what if we’re NOT on this list?</strong></p>
<p>What if we’re NOT</p>
<ul>
<li>poor,</li>
<li>mourning,</li>
<li>meek,</li>
<li>hungry,</li>
<li>merciful,</li>
<li>pure-hearted,</li>
<li>peacemakers</li>
<li>who are persecuted?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if we’re</p>
<ul>
<li>reasonably well-educated</li>
<li>and wealthy,</li>
<li>comfortable,</li>
<li>powerful</li>
<li>American</li>
<li>Christians?</li>
</ul>
<p>How should we respond to the Beatitudes?</p>
<p>While I <strong>DON’T</strong> think that the Beatitudes should be read like a <strong>TO-DO list</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>I DO think that the Beatitudes are an <u>instructive</u> <u>challenge</u> to followers of Jesus.</strong></p>
<p>There is a reason why the Beatitudes are at the beginning of Jesus’ quintessential sermon.</p>
<p>It’s almost like Jesus is saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“OK, you want to follow me?</p>
<p>You want to be a part of my coming Kingdom? Then let’s get really clear on <strong>what this Kingdom is going to be like</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be the kind of Kingdom you’re used to in this world.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of kingdom where the <strong>wealthy</strong>, <strong>wise</strong>, and <strong>powerful</strong> get <u>rewarded</u>.</p>
<p>Instead, in MY Kingdom, <strong>the people who get <u>chewed up</u> and <u>spit out</u> by the kingdoms of this world will be <u>rewarded</u> and <u>honored</u>.</strong></p>
<p>SO,</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want to be a part of my Kingdom,</li>
<li>if you want to “get ahead” in my Kingdom,</li>
<li>then <strong>you better show concrete concern for</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>the oppressed,</strong></li>
<li><strong>the marginalized,</strong></li>
<li><strong>and the weak!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as you do so, you’d better be prepared to end up among the oppressed and the marginalized, because the world is going to think you are out of your minds!”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fear-is-not-a-valid-excuse">Fear is NOT a Valid Excuse</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, remember:</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But there is no escape clause from the rules of God’s Kingdom!</strong></p>
<p>That is, you can’t just ignore Jesus and the Bible because you’re SCARED.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>how a congregation is going to respond to your sermon,</strong></li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>looking foolish</strong>,</li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>losing your job</strong>,</li>
<li>Because you’re scared of <strong>a terrorist attack</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not that Jesus doesn’t care about your fears. He does.</p>
<p><em><strong>But let’s not kid ourselves!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>FEAR</strong> is not a valid excuse for ignoring the Bible’s repeated commands for God’s people to show faithful concern for the kinds of people the world ignores and mistreats!</p>

<h2 id="application-consistently-pro-life-for-the-unborn-and-the-refugees">Application: Consistently Pro-Life, for the Unborn AND the Refugees</h2>
<p>So, let’s get practical here. How should we respond to these passages about God’s Upside-Down Kingdom?</p>
<p>We must show concrete concern for the powerless. And two recent issues come to mind, that I would be a coward not to mention.</p>
<h3 id="abortion">Abortion</h3>
<p><strong><u>First</u></strong>, in light of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Life_(Washington,_D.C.)">44th March for Life</a> held this past weekend, <strong>I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that we must continue to stand up for the unborn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abortion</strong> is a gruesome <strong>evil</strong>. And like other forms of evil, it is complex – not easily eradicated.</p>
<p>As Christians, we must wage war against this evil. And that will involve caring not only for the <strong>unborn child</strong>, but also the <strong>mother</strong>, and the child <strong>after</strong> it is born, and the entire <strong>family</strong>.</p>
<p>Repealing Roe v. Wade isn’t going to completely solve the problem.</p>
<p>Christians will have to step up to the plate and be <strong>consistently pro-life</strong> in order to fix things.</p>
<p>If you’re passionate about this issue, I encourage you to check out the organization <a href="http://anglicansforlife.org/"><strong>Anglicans for Life</strong></a> at <strong><a href="http://anglicansforlife.org/">AnglicansForLife.Org</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>So, first, we must stand up for the unborn.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="refugees">Refugees</h3>
<p><strong><u>Second</u></strong>, given <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/01/trump-immigration-order-muslims/514844/">President Trump’s recent executive actions</a> to halt the acceptance of all refugees to the USA, including a temporary moratorium on seven predominantly Muslim countries,</p>
<p><strong>I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you that, if we are to be consistently pro-life, we must also stand up for the <u>refugees</u>.</strong></p>
<p>Next to the unborn, refugees around the world – but especially from Syria – are among the most <strong>vulnerable</strong> and <strong>powerless</strong> people in the world.</p>
<p>Christians should be standing up for and supporting these people. And, to their credit, many Christians are doing so.</p>
<p>I’d encourage you to check out the great work being done by organizations like <a href="https://www.worldrelief.org/"><strong>World Relief</strong></a> and <a href="https://wewelcomerefugees.com/"><strong>We Welcome Refugees</strong></a>. Talk to me after the service if you’d like more ideas and reading recommendations, by the way.</p>
<p>However, many Christians in this country are <strong>falling prey to the fear excuse</strong>.</p>
<p>We’re being tempted to turn away these vulnerable people because of the <strong>supposed risk of a terrorist attack</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u><strong>I’m here this morning to plead with you: Do not fall prey to this nonsense.</strong> </u></strong></p>
<p>Even if the fear were <em><strong>legitimate</strong></em>, it is no <strong>excuse</strong> for Christians not to show concrete love to the powerless.</p>
<p>Whoever said that following Jesus would not involve any risks?</p>
<p>We dare not worship the <em><strong>American gods</strong></em> of <strong>comfort</strong> and <strong>security</strong> while neglecting to follow the True God’s commands.</p>
<p>However, <strong>these fears of refugees are VASTLY overblown.</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf">a September 2016 <strong>Policy Analysis</strong> from the <strong>CATO</strong> institute</a>,</p>
<ul>
<li>“the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a <strong>refugee</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>1 in 3.64 billion per year.”</strong></li>
<li>The chance of being murdered in a terrorist attack committed by an <strong>asylum-seeker is 1 in 2.73 billion per year.</strong></li>
<li>And “the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an <strong>illegal</strong> <strong>immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>For comparison: <a href="http://www.nsc.org/learn/safety-knowledge/Pages/injury-facts-chart.aspx">according to the National Safety Council</a>, <strong>your chance of dying from a lightning strike is 1 in 174,426</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong><u><strong>That means it’s about 20,868 times more likely that you will get killed by lightning than by a refugee terrorist attack.</strong></u></strong></em></p>
<p>While we’re worried about astronomical odds, these people are dying. The death toll from the Syrian conflict is approaching half a million, including 50 thousand children.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, please don’t mishear me. I’m not saying that the USA shouldn’t change anything about its policies. Surely there are many problems which need fixed.</p>
<p>However, I beg you: please do not fall prey to the fear-mongering. Please think and reason as <strong>Christians</strong> first.</p>
<p>After all, you can only give your “total allegiance” to one thing.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ will not settle for second place to the United States.</strong></p>
<p>So, stand up for the unborn and the refugees, not to mention the countless other marginalized, oppressed, and powerless people around us.</p>
<p>And I don’t even have time to get into how Christians should be concerned for religious liberties for all faiths. That’s a whole other sermon…</p>
<p><strong>Because God’s Kingdom is an “upside-down” Kingdom, getting ahead in the Kingdom of God will frequently look foolish in the eyes of the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But, if our Gospel is true, then we of all people should be willing to put our lives and our reputations at risk for the sake of others – especially for the poor and the needy.</strong></p>
<h2 id="closing-prayer">Closing Prayer</h2>
<p>So, again, God, our Refuge, I ask that your Holy Spirit would transform us from the inside out</p>
<ul>
<li>So that we would promote your <strong>justice</strong></li>
<li>So that we would embody your <strong>steadfast faithful love</strong></li>
<li>and so that we would <strong>humbly</strong> obey Your will,</li>
<li>even if it costs us our <em>reputations</em>,</li>
<li>and even if it costs us our <em>lives</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ask that this transformation would begin with me, and that it would extend to the ends of the earth. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>
