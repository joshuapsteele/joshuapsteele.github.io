    <meta name="description" content="…and by “club” I of course mean “Church”!
What am I getting at? Am I calling the Church a mere “club”?
No. Although, unfortunately, it often feels that way, doesn’t it?

A club full of hypocrisy, idolatry, indifference, and platitudes.
A club full of power-plays, fear-mongering, and Bible-thumping.
A club full of saints too afraid to admit that they are sinners.

Perhaps you’re sick of this “club,” and you’re ready to leave, if you haven’t left already.">

<p>What am I getting at? Am I calling the Church a mere “club”?</p>
<p>No. Although, unfortunately, it often feels that way, doesn’t it?</p>
<ul>
<li>A club full of hypocrisy, idolatry, indifference, and platitudes.</li>
<li>A club full of power-plays, fear-mongering, and Bible-thumping.</li>
<li>A club full of saints too afraid to admit that they are sinners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps you’re sick of this “club,” and you’re ready to leave, if you haven’t left already.</p>
<p>I’m asking you to stay. To come back. To join for the first time.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the Church must be composed of people who realize the Church’s shortcomings and failures.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>is</strong></em></span> <strong>just a club.</strong></p>
<p>I’m asking you to stay, because most leaders within the Church share your frustrations.</p>
<p>Because the strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community.</p>
<p>And because, as I’ll talk about tomorrow, you’re part of the problems. And so am I.</p>
<p>So, let’s work toward solving them together. Within the Church.</p>
