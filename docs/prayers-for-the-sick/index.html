Prayers for the Sick
For a Sick Person
O Father of mercies and God of all comfort, our only help in time of need: We humbly beseech thee to behold, visit, and relieve thy sick servant N. for whom our prayers are desired. Look upon him with the eyes of thy mercy; comfort him with a sense of thy goodness; preserve him from the temptations of the enemy; and give him patience under his affliction. In thy good time, restore him to health, and enable him to lead the residue of his life in thy fear, and to thy glory; and grant that finally he may dwell with thee in life everlasting; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.">

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Good Shepherd of the sheep, you gather the lambs in your arms and carry them in your bosom: We commend to your loving care this child <em>N.</em> Relieve <em>his</em> pain, guard <em>him</em> from all danger, restore to <em>him</em> your gifts of gladness and strength, and raise <em>him</em> up to a life of service to you. Hear us, we pray, for you dear Name’s sake. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<h3 id="before-an-operation">Before an Operation</h3>
<p>Almighty God our heavenly Father, graciously comfort your servant <em>N.</em> in <em>his</em> suffering, and bless the means made use of for his cure. Fill <em>his</em> heart with confidence that, though at times <em>he</em> may be afraid, <em>he</em> yet may put <em>his</em> trust in you; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<p>or this</p>
<p>Strengthen your servant <em>N.</em>, O God, to do what <em>he</em> has to do and bear what <em>he</em> has to bear; that, accepting your healing gifts through the skill of surgeons and nurses, <em>he</em> may be restored to usefulness in your world with a thankful heart; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<h3 id="for-strength-and-confidence">For Strength and Confidence</h3>
<p>Heavenly Father, giver of life and health: Comfort and relieve your sick servant <em>N.</em>, and give your power of healing to those who minister to <em>his</em> needs, that <em>he</em> may be strengthened in <em>his</em> weakness and have confidence in your loving care; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<h3 id="for-the-sanctification-of-illness">For the Sanctification of Illness</h3>
<p>Sanctify, O Lord, the sickness of your servant <em>N.</em>, that the sense of <em>his</em> weakness may add strength to <em>his</em> faith and seriousness to <em>his</em> repentance; and grant that <em>he</em> may live with you in everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<h3 id="for-health-of-body-and-soul">For Health of Body and Soul</h3>

<h3 id="thanksgiving-for-a-beginning-of-recovery">Thanksgiving for a Beginning of Recovery</h3>
<p>O Lord, your compassions never fail and your mercies are new every morning: We give you thanks for giving our brother (sister) <em>N.</em> both relief from pain and hope of health renewed.

<h3 id="in-pain">In Pain</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, by your patience in suffering you hallowed earthly pain and gave us the example of obedience to your Father’s will: Be near me in my time of weakness and pain; sustain me by your grace, that my strength and courage may not fail; heal me according to your will; and help me always to believe that what happens to me here is of little account if you hold me in eternal life, my Lord and my God. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<h3 id="for-sleep">For Sleep</h3>
<p>O heavenly Father, you give your children sleep for the refreshing of soul and body: Grant me this gift, I pray; keep me in that perfect peace which you have promised to those whose minds are fixed on you; and give me such a sense of your presence, that in the hours of silence I may enjoy the blessed assurance of your love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>
<h3 id="in-the-morning">In the Morning</h3>
<p>This is another day, O Lord. I know not what it will bring forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I am to stand up, help me to stand bravely. If I am to sit still, help me to sit quietly. If I am to lie low, help me to do it patiently. And if I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly. Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit of Jesus. <em>Amen.</em></p>
