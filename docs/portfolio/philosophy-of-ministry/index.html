    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Every Christian is a theologian.</p>
<p>I consider it my life&rsquo;s work to help &ldquo;everyday Christians&rdquo; grow in their knowledge and love of God so that we all can put our gifts to good use by joining with God&rsquo;s redemptive work in the world. In biblical terms, I&rsquo;m called to &ldquo;equip the saints for the work of ministry&rdquo; and to &ldquo;build up the body of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:12).</p>
<p>Now, on the one hand, this means that I’m not supposed to do all the work of ministry myself! I am not an expert who asks the non-specialists to step aside so that the real work can be done by a professional. No! The “ministry” is done by all the saints, not just the ordained clergy.</p>
<p>And yet, on the other hand, I must set the saints a good example in my life and work. I must constantly grow in the knowledge and love of God if I am to be &ldquo;a messenger, watchman, and steward of the Lord&rdquo; who can &ldquo;teach, to warn, to feed, and to provide for the Lord&rsquo;s family&rdquo; (2019 BCP, p. 489).</p>
<p>Pastoral ministry requires a lifelong devotion to the Word of God. As my bishop put it when I was ordained to the priesthood, &ldquo;the demands of this holy Office are so great&rdquo; that I must &ldquo;lay aside all worldly distractions and take care to direct all that [I] do to this purpose: read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the Scriptures&rdquo; (2019 BCP, p. 489).</p>
<p>Put simply: Bible study—and not just for sermon preparation—is essential for pastoral ministry. I will not be able to &ldquo;frame [my] conduct, and that of my household and those committed to [my] care, according to the doctrine and discipline of Christ&rdquo; (2019 BCP, p. 489) unless I&rsquo;m saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to enough other things to protect the time and space I need to digest the Scriptures.</p>
<p>But, of course, I can’t accomplish any of this on my own. I need to “pray earnestly” for the “Holy Spirit to enlighten [my] mind and strengthen [my] resolve” (2019 BCP, p. 489). To equip the saints for the work of ministry, I need to saturate my life with Scripture and prayer. This is the two-stroke engine, as it were, that drives a genuinely successful ministry of Word and Sacrament. It’s the part of my ordination vows that enables me to do the other things I vowed to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;to minister the doctrine, sacraments, and discipline of Christ, as the Lord has commanded and this Church has received them, according to the commandments of God, so that [I] may teach the people committed to [my] charge with all diligence to keep and observe them&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;to banish and drive away from the Body of Christ all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to God’s Word&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;to use both public and private admonitions and exhortations, to the weak as well as the strong within [my] charge, as need shall require and occasion be given&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;to frame and fashion my own life and the life of my family, according to the doctrine of Christ, and to make myself and them, as much as I am able, a wholesome example and pattern to the flock of Christ&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;to maintain and set forward, as much as I am able, quietness, peace, and love among all Christian people, and especially among those who are or shall be committed to my charge&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;to obey my Bishop and other chief Ministers who, according to the Canons of this Church, may have charge and authority over [me], following with a glad mind and a good will their godly admonitions, and submitting [myself] to their godly judgments&rdquo; (2019 BCP, pp. 490–91).</li>
</ul>
<p>Such is the ministry of Word and Sacrament to which I have been called and ordained within Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, as a pastor, I am not a CEO, guru, or celebrity speaker. Instead, I am an under-shepherd, with delegated authority from the Good Shepherd to feed and equip his flock to do the work he has called us all to do.</p>
