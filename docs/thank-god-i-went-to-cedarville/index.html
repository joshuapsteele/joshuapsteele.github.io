<p>All things considered, my time at CU <strong>exposed me to the riches of biblical and theological studies, and it left me hungry for more</strong>.</p>
<p>College gave me a <strong>love for Christ‚Äôs gospel and Christ‚Äôs Church</strong> ‚Äì which has only increased since I arrived at Beeson.</p>
<p>Plus, I met my wife there! üôÇ</p>
<p><img src="https://joshuapsteele.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pablo-10-300x300.png" alt="pablo (10)"></p>
<p>And yet, college also <em><strong>left a bad taste in my mouth</strong></em>.</p>
<p>See, in the year before I graduated, <a href="https://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">some crazy things went down</a> at my alma mater.</p>
<ul>
<li>It all started with some <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Job-Openings/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx">sketchy White Papers</a> getting sprung on the faculty right before contract renewal.</li>
<li>Then, it led to the secret summer firing of a professor.</li>
<li>I reacted <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/">on</a> <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/21/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-2/">my</a> <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/22/an-explanation/">blog</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november/crisis-of-faith-statements.html">Christianity Today</a> picked it up. As well as <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/cedarville-plays-professor-on-leave/nSwDJ/">a local newspaper</a>.</li>
<li>The same day the Christianity Today piece ran, the President ‚Äúresigned.‚Äù</li>
<li>So did the Vice President of Student Life.</li>
<li>You know what? It‚Äôs a long story, just <a href="https://storify.com/fiatlux125/cedarville-2012-2013/">read it here if you‚Äôre interested</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Between my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2012/09/20/cedarville-let-there-be-light-pt-1/">original blogpost</a> and my ‚Äú<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/2013/04/24/a-farewell-to-cedarville/">final farewell,</a>‚Äù I tried to take a pretty active role in the student protests against what was going on at CU.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to think we made a bit of a difference ‚Äì perhaps in slowing things down enough to let professors find jobs elsewhere before they got fired. Heck, we even made it into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/us/a-christian-college-struggles-to-define-itself.html">The New York Times</a>. (Although, I will say: I‚Äôm embarrassed of the picture they chose for the article.)</p>
<p>However, in the long run, <strong>we failed</strong>.</p>
<p>Cedarville is now a much different place than when I arrived. What‚Äôs more, I became so entangled in the mess that I arrived to seminary with some burn wounds ‚Äì from a prophetic fire that burnt a bit too hot.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm <strong>thankful</strong> for my time at Cedarville, however.</p>
<p>God has been healing those wounds. Beeson Divinity School and Anglicanism have both been balms to my spirit. And, with the healing has come the realization that I would not be who I am today were it not for my four years in Cedarville, Ohio.</p>
<p>Many of the lessons I learned there were sealed with blood, sweat, and tears ‚Äì as it were. However, those kinds of lessons are often the most important and enduring.</p>
<p>By God‚Äôs grace, I hope to carry forward into my future ministry a combination of prophetic fire and patient faithfulness in the face of injustice and suffering.</p>
<h2 id="heres-the-thing-though-im-worried-about-the-other-members-of-the-cedarville-diaspora">Here‚Äôs the thing, though: I‚Äôm worried about the other members of the ‚ÄúCedarville Diaspora.‚Äù</h2>
<p>‚ÄúCedarville ex-pats‚Äù? Take your pick of terms.</p>
<p>No, not so much the professors who were pushed out. They‚Äôve miraculously landed on their feet, and I‚Äôve witnessed God‚Äôs powerful work of redemption through them in their current careers and ministries.</p>
<p>No, I‚Äôm talking about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>alumni</strong></em></span> who got burned by fundamentalism and may have already <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/08/on-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater-a-message-for-abused-ex-fundamentalists/">thrown out the Christian baby with the fundamentalist bathwater</a>. Or perhaps they‚Äôre seriously considering doing so.</p>
<p>See, God has blessed me with a wonderful seminary and church community in which to grow and heal after Cedarville. Without those things, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be after the awful ending to my Christian college experience.</p>
<p>Others, however, may be feeling very <strong>lonely</strong> and <strong>angry</strong> right now.</p>
<p><strong>If that‚Äôs you, or if you know someone to whom this applies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would you let me know if there‚Äôs any way I can help you</span>?</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôll gladly listen to you vent. I‚Äôd love to pray for you specifically, and perhaps to share what I‚Äôve found helpful along the journey.</p>
