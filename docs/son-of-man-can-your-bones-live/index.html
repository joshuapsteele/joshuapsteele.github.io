<p>What would it be like, tonight, if Jesus has been dead for almost 33 hours?</p>
<p>All the hopes and dreams of tonight’s readings – shattered. Blown away by the cold winds of death. Jesus of Nazareth lies in a dark grave, and we, his shell-shocked followers, gather to make some sort of sense of this week’s events – to salvage some sort of hope from this week’s wreckage.</p>
<p>And so, some sorry snots get up to try and encourage us. They open up the Hebrew Scriptures and read about our great God.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, when He made the heavens, earth, and humans?</li>
<li>Remember, when He rescued Noah?</li>
<li>Remember, when he stayed Abraham’s knife-laden hand?</li>
<li>Remember, when he rescued us from Egypt?</li>
<li>Remember, when he promised to bring us back from exile, restore our fortunes, and open our… graves?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s too much, too soon. Shut up and sit down! Leave us mourn and weep awhile! Jesus is dead! The one we thought would save us is dead!</p>
<p>It’s been over a day. It’s been almost 2,000 years.</p>
<p><strong>Can these bones live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can these bones live?</strong></p>
<p>The question haunts us. The answer is so obviously “No! Of course not! They’re bones! No flesh, no breath, no life!”</p>
<p>And yet, God asks Ezekiel. And He asks us. Can these bones live?</p>
<p>And sure, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.</p>
<p>Can these bones live? Can <strong>Christ’s</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Surely this question must have flickered in someone’s mind on the first Holy Saturday. And, yes, we know the answer, but sit with this awhile.</p>
<p>Look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">world</span>! Dealing in death, day by day. Wars. Famines. Floods. Diseases. Droughts. Death.</p>
<p>Can <strong>these</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Look at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Church</span>! Claiming with her lips to follow Jesus Christ, and yet so often proving with her life that she wants no such thing. Scandal. Hypocrisy. Idolatry.</p>
<p>Can <strong>these</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>Look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yourselves</span>! I’ll be honest, the question “can these bones live?” is put to every preacher facing a congregation! If the Spirit doesn’t move, I’m throwing hot air at dry bones!</p>
<p>Can <strong>your</strong> bones live?</p>
<p>But then, look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>! Just as scandalous, hypocritical, and idolatrous as any – and yet here I stand, presuming to proclaim the Word of God to you.</p>
<p>Who do I think I am? Can <strong>my</strong> bones live?</p>
<p><strong>Can all these dry, dead bones live?</strong></p>
<p>Friends, there’s a reason why we’re here, though it’s so dark, so late. Sure, it’s to bring in, bright and oh so early, the celebration of Easter.</p>
<p>But it’s also because <strong>keeping vigil is what the Church does every day</strong>. We keep vigil for the sake of a suffering and dying world. We keep watch for our bridegroom to return and wipe away every tear, to right every wrong. We stay awake at the world’s late hour, surrounded by so many dry, dead bones.</p>
<p>Can these bones live?</p>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> They can. But, what do they need in order to do so?</p>
<p>First, they need some WATER. Did you notice how often water has appeared in tonight’s readings?</p>
<ul>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">creation</span>, out of which God called the dry ground – out of which He formed human beings.</li>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">judgment</span>, through which God saved Noah and his family in the Ark.</li>
<li>The waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">redemption</span>, through which God rescued Israel from the Egyptian house of slavery.</li>
<li>And the waters of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cleansing</span>, by which the Lord promised in the prophets to wash away His people’s guilty stains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Water, water, everywhere! Except the dry valley.</p>
<p>I think the dry bones need some sort of <strong>water</strong>.</p>
<p>They also need some sort of SPIRIT. You know, God’s Spirit, His breath, His wind, who hovered over the waters at creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who filled the first humans with life.</li>
<li>Who led God’s people.</li>
<li>Who inspired and preserved the words of Scripture we read this evening.</li>
<li>Who rushed upon the dry bones in Ezekiel’s vision – making them into a great army, alive!</li>
</ul>
<p>Dry bones need the <strong>Spirit</strong>.</p>
<p>But, the question isn’t “Can these bones get <strong>wet</strong> and <strong>windy</strong>?” It’s “Can they <strong>LIVE</strong>?!”</p>
<p>And, if they’re going to live, they’re going to need a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>RESURRECTION</strong></em></span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>They need the defeat of their most ancient enemy: Death!</li>
<li>They need Death’s reversal! They need Death’s death!</li>
<li>They need exactly what God promised Ezekiel: to open their graves, and lift them up, living!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amen! Glory, glory, hallelujah!</strong></p>
<p>But, if I hear Ezekiel’s glorious vision read at the first Holy Saturday, I’m tempted to <strong>lose it</strong> at this point. To bitterly ask those gathered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>When</strong>?! That sounds great, but <strong>when</strong>?! <strong>When</strong> is God going to do this?!</p>
<p>For over <strong>five hundred years</strong> since Ezekiel, we’ve been falling into our graves over and over again – and staying there! Sure, it’s no longer in Babylon, but we’ve been invaded and harassed and dominated here in Judah ever since!</p>
<p>Is it really that much better to fall into the grave under Rome’s heavy heel, like Jesus?</p>
<p>Why not Babylon’s?</p>
<p>Why not Assyria’s?</p>
<p>Heck, why not Pharaoh’s?</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> is God going to turn things around?!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, I wasn’t in the audience back then. But we’re here, tonight. And maybe you’re similarly tempted to lose it and freak out sometimes in church!</p>
<p>All this pretty Jesus-talk, when for over 2,000 years the Church has travailed in the midst of a deadly and dying world.</p>
<p>We thank Jesus for our oversized meals, cars, and houses, while thousands fall into their graves around us – tired, hungry, destitute, and alone.</p>
<p>So, on the first Holy Saturday and the 2,000th, the question is roughly the same:</p>
<p><strong>When</strong>?! <strong>When</strong> is God going to turn things around?!</p>
<p>And the answer is likewise the same. We sang it, earlier:</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS THE NIGHT.</strong></p>
<p>When did God open the grave?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>THIS IS THE NIGHT</strong>, when Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <strong>can these bones live? Yes!</strong></p>
<p>Can <strong>Christ’s</strong> bones live? Yes! For on this night, some 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ got up from the tomb. He was alive. He was dead. But he is now alive again.</p>
<p>Can <strong>our</strong> bones live? Yes!</p>
<p>How? Because Christ has provided the <strong>resurrection</strong>, the <strong>Spirit</strong>, and the <strong>water</strong> we need.</p>
<p>Because, through the waters of <strong>baptism</strong>, we receive the Spirit and the resurrection.</p>
<p>Now, we aren’t going to baptize anyone tonight. We’ll have to wait until later this morning to do so. But we are about to renew our baptismal vows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>preserved</strong>, like Noah, from the waters of Sin and Death, in the Ark, the Church.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>ransomed</strong> and rescued, like Israel, through the waters of the Red Sea.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>cleansed</strong> with the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, as God promised through Isaiah and Ezekiel.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>buried</strong> with Christ in his death, and are <strong>raised</strong> with him in newness of life.</li>
<li>Through our baptism, we are <strong>empowered</strong> and <strong>emboldened</strong> to <strong>proclaim</strong> the good news to a desperate world that JESUS CHRIST IS RISEN.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, we can assure the world that their bones can live, because <strong>Christ has died</strong>.</p>
<p>We can rest assured that our bones can live, because <strong>Christ is risen</strong>.</p>
<p>And we can keep watch for the sake of a suffering world, because <strong>Jesus Christ will come again</strong>.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
