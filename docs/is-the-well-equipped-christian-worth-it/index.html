<p>I have.</p>
<p>Certain Google searches are a piece of cake, but the “best resources for ______” ones can be hit-or-miss.</p>
<p>And don’t even get me started on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision fatigue</a>. As a serial over-thinker, I start to hate myself a little bit after reading through the upteenth list of “5 Best ____s.” It makes it so hard to make a decision! Then, when you pick something, you end up doubting your decision. Not fun.</p>
<p>I’m sure these dynamics apply to a bunch of different things in life. However, while serving as a Youth Minister in seminary, I realized that finding reliable Christian recommendations and resources can be very difficult.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s not for lack of content out there! When it comes to Christianity, everyone has an opinion – and usually an associated reading list!</p>
<p>But how do you know that the book or blog-post that you find isn’t from some crazy yahoo with nothing more than a computer and a Bible?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you’re a Christian and your looking for recommendations and resources in some <em>other</em> area, how do you know that what you find is worthwhile?</p>
<p>I mean, sure, <em>everything</em> should be read with a critical eye. But is that latest book or blog-post about mindfulness, parenting, self-help, or productivity helpful and useful for Christians? Or will it require quite a bit of theological critique and analysis before it’s helpful without being potentially harmful?</p>
<p>Google is great, and getting better at many things. But – at least for right now – it’s a pretty crappy theologian!</p>
<h1 id="idea-the-well-equipped-christian">Idea: The Well-Equipped Christian</h1>
<p>With all this in mind, I have an idea: <em><strong>The Well-Equipped Christian</strong></em> (or a similar title) – a website that’s a one-stop shop for Christians looking for reliable recommendations and resources.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, I’m not claiming to BE the well-equipped Christian! I am not the be-all-end-all source of reliable Christian information.</p>
<p>However, I am a Christian with a seminary education. I’m pursuing a PhD in theology, and I have a heart for the Church.</p>
<p>I want to devote my life and ministry to helping to produce as many “well-equipped Christians” as possible. And I absolutely <strong>love</strong> giving practical recommendations – specifically in the areas of Bible study, theology, productivity, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning">meta-learning</a>.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great resources out there. Resources that Christians can benefit from to have healthy <strong>minds</strong>, <strong>bodies</strong>, and <strong>souls</strong> as they advance God’s Kingdom in their daily lives.</p>
<p>I want to connect you to those resources.</p>
<h1 id="i-need-your-help">I Need Your Help</h1>
<p>Are you wiling to help me figure out whether or not this is a good idea? If so, great! <strong>I’d love to hear your answers to the following questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the biggest problem that you’ve faced in finding reliable recommendations and resources?</strong> Not just for specifically Christian resources (although that’s great if you want to focus on that), but also for resources in general.</li>
<li><strong>When you talk to your friends about finding reliable recommendations and resources, what kinds of things do you say?</strong> Any specific feelings or complaints?</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, please share this post with anyone you think would be willing to give me their input! Thank you so much!</p>
<p>~Josh</p>
