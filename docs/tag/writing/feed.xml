      <description>Because good writing = good thinking, I believe that everyone could benefit from developing the habit of regular writing.
However, because I
Am a Ph.D. student about to begin work on his dissertation Edit a blog ( Rookie Anglican) Write this personal blog I really need to develop the habit of regular writing.
Up until now, I’ve largely relied upon writing in fits and starts, when the Muse descends, as it were.</description>
