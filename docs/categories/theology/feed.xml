      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: Thank you to the Rev. Dr. Emily McGowin for writing this rejoinder to &lt;a href=&#34;http://theopolisinstitute.com/sacramental-representation-and-the-created-order/&#34;&gt;Fr. Blake Johnson’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicancompass.com/the-problem-with-making-a-patristic-argument-for-the-ordination-of-women-a-response-to-emily-mcgowin/&#34;&gt;Fr. Lee Nelson’s&lt;/a&gt; responses to &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicancompass.com/if-women-can-be-saved-then-women-can-be-priests/&#34;&gt;her original blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the&lt;/em&gt; in persona Christi &lt;em&gt;argument against women’s ordination. While we invite this conversation (about McGowin’s original blog post) to continue in our comments section and elsewhere—and we plan to publish more about women’s ordination in the future—we will not be adding surrejoinder blog posts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: The piece below represents the opinion of the author. Anglican Pastor does not take a site-wide position for or against women’s ordination. We do, however, require both clarity and charity. We ask that your responses to it do so as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After reading this piece, please see &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicancompass.com/the-problem-with-making-a-patristic-argument-for-the-ordination-of-women-a-response-to-emily-mcgowin/&#34;&gt;Lee Nelson’s response&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://anglicancompass.com/taking-scripture-and-womens-ordination-seriously-a-response-to-blake-johnson-and-lee-nelson/&#34;&gt;Emily McGowin’s rejoinder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-connection-between-christology-and-soteriology&#34;&gt;The connection between christology and soteriology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A cornerstone of orthodox Christian theology is summed up in the phrase “what is not assumed is not healed”. The phrase is echoed by many early church fathers, but it is credited to St. Gregory of Nazianzus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
