      <description>I don’t know what it is about mini toolkits, but I love them.
Actually, scratch that. I know why. It’s the same reason I love buying tools and books, more generally: the illusion of control. I like how having tools (and a great personal library) makes me feel like I’m ready for whatever life throws at me (ha!).
It’s why I liked carrying around a pocketknife as a kid, and it’s why I’m into EDC (everyday carry) and tools as an adult.</description>

      <description>We bought our first house in late 2023 and, since moving-in in January 2024, I’ve been chipping away at home improvement projects. Since I’m a software engineer and spend my day in front of a screen, I enjoy working with tools as a change of pace.
Now, some upcoming projects will clearly outstrip my capabilities and I plan to hire professionals:
– Replace roof and gutters
– Replace furnace and central air conditioning</description>
