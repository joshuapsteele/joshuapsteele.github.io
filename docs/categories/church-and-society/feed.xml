      <title>You Can&#39;t Follow Jesus and Hate Immigrants</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Christianity and Politics: My 2024 Reading List</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election. Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>25 Possibly Unpopular Opinions about Church</title>
      <link>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/25-possibly-unpopular-opinions-about-church/</link>

      <guid>https://joshuapsteele.github.io/25-possibly-unpopular-opinions-about-church/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following are some of my opinions, held with varying levels of intensity, about church/churches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: These are geared toward Christian churches in the USA. Some would obviously also apply to churches elsewhere. But I haven’t nuanced this entire list for all global church contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many churches in the USA are too “busy.” They are trying to do too many different things and should instead refocus on the church’s proper priorities (Word and Sacraments).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-peter-417&#34;&gt;1 Peter 4:17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;isaiah-58114&#34;&gt;Isaiah 58:1–14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shout out, do not hold back!&lt;br&gt;
Lift up your voice like a trumpet!&lt;br&gt;
Announce to my people their rebellion,&lt;br&gt;
to the house of Jacob their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet day after day they seek me&lt;br&gt;
and delight to know my ways,&lt;br&gt;
as if they were a nation that practiced righteousness&lt;br&gt;
and did not forsake the ordinance of their God;&lt;br&gt;
they ask of me righteous judgments,&lt;br&gt;
they delight to draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
