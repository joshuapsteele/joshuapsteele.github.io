      <description>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.
Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!
But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.
What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?
What if the immigrants are in your country legally?</description>

      <description>The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election. Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.
(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.</description>

      <description>The following are some of my opinions, held with varying levels of intensity, about church/churches.

      <description>1 Peter 4:17 For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God; if it begins with us, what will be the end for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
Isaiah 58:1–14 Shout out, do not hold back!
Lift up your voice like a trumpet!
Announce to my people their rebellion,
to the house of Jacob their sins.
Yet day after day they seek me</description>
