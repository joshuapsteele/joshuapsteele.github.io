      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What if the immigrants are in your country legally? What if they’re your brothers and sisters in Christ? Does that make any difference in what you think and feel about them? Or are they still primarily “illegals” who are “ruining this country”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>You can’t follow Jesus and hate immigrants.
Of course, this does NOT settle every question of immigration policy!
But, if you’re a follower of Jesus, consider your overall posture toward immigrants. If you call yourself a Christian, I want you to think about this seriously.
What comes into your head and your heart when you think of immigrants and refugees? Fear? Anger? Disgust?
What if the immigrants are in your country legally?</description>

      <title>Are the Beatitudes “Renunciations” (Verzichte)?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Discipleship&lt;/em&gt; (DBWE 4), Dietrich Bonhoeffer frames all of the Beatitudes in terms of Jesus’ disciples living in &lt;em&gt;renunciation&lt;/em&gt; (Verzicht) and &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; (Mangel).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, for Bonhoeffer, Jesus is only speaking to his disciples in the Beatitudes (he makes this argument on the basis of Luke 6:20ff.). And the disciples’ renunciation and want are &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; by Jesus’s call to discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesus sees&lt;/em&gt;: his disciples are over there. They have visibly left the people to join him. He has called each individual one. They have given up everything in response to his call. Now they are living in renunciation and want; they are the poorest of the poor, the most tempted of the tempted, the hungriest of the hungry. They have only him. Yes, and with him they have nothing in the world, nothing at all, but everything, everything with God. (DBWE 4:101).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’m trying to get a better handle on how Barth and Bonhoeffer treat the Sermon on the Mount, and I’m starting with the Beatitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s pretty challenging to situate Barth and Bonhoeffer in light of the “standard” approaches to both the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount. A case in point: yesterday, I felt pretty confident that Bonhoeffer does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take the standard “entrance requirements” approach to the Beatitudes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: Here is the paper that I gave at the 2019 Karl Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at the Center for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#post-41871-footnote-1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#post-41871-footnote-2&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In other words, when will God’s kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)? Furthermore, who brings the kingdom about? Humans? God? Or some combination of the two? Settling the question of eschatology involves both the timing and the agency, the &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt;, of the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had to consult &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/3878/a-greek-english-lexicon-of-the-new-testament-and-other-early-christian-literature-3rd-ed&#34;&gt;“BDAG,” A Greek–English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (3rd ed.)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t own a copy, so every time I have to consult BDAG I think “I really should buy this.” But for the past decade or so, primarily because of BDAG’s cost ($150 on Logos, $130 used on Amazon, $165 new on Amazon) I’ve held off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I’m seeking to build my “must-have” personal reference library to sustain a ministry as a pastor theologian. So, I think I need to buy BDAG sometime soon. While I’m at it, I might as well get HALOT, the Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament… &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.logos.com/product/5228/bdag-halot-bundle&#34;&gt;Logos sells them as a bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Two of us are theologians and the other four are bible scholars.

The professor didn’t remember where the prayer was from, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/a-corporate-confession-of-faith-based-on-the-ten-commandments-and-the-sermon-on-the-mount/&#34;&gt;I tracked it down online.

But it is not only unclean lips we possess. We are people with unclean hands and unclean hearts. We have broken your law times without number, and are guilty of pride, unbelief, self-centeredness and idolatry. Affect our hearts with the severity of our sin and the glory of your righteousness as we now acknowledge our sins in your holy presence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the Psalm opens:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;Unless the &lt;span class=&#34;small-caps&#34;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; builds the house,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1-breaks&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;the builders labor in vain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;Unless the &lt;span class=&#34;small-caps&#34;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; watches over the city,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;indent-1-breaks&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text Ps-127-1&#34;&gt;the guards stand watch in vain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Personal Productivity in Psalm 127 I love Psalm 127. Not because it makes me feel great, necessarily, but because it hits me like a ton of bricks whenever I read it (like I did last night, during evening prayer).
Here’s how the Psalm opens:
Unless the Lord builds the house,
the builders labor in vain.
Unless the Lord watches over the city,
the guards stand watch in vain.
I don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to think that my success or lack thereof completely depends on me and the intensity of my efforts.</description>

They combine the expected and the unexpected. I mean, on one hand, you’ve got comfort food. On the other hand, heinous crimes.

There is something special about last meals, isn’t there?
I’d like to show you a series of photographs. These photographs, except for the last one – which I added, are from a piece called “No Seconds,” and they were put together by Henry Hargreaves.
I don’t want to belabor the artwork with my commentary, so I’ll give you a few seconds to take each slide in.

There are a few things you should know about me:
I am a student at a Christian seminary. Before that, I went to a Christian college. Before that, I went to a Christian high school, and a Christian middle school. Before that, I was home-schooled, and I grew up in a Christian home. Oh, also: I’m the world’s worst sports fan.
I’m serious. The students in my youth group give me a hard time about it.</description>

Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey!
But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.
So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.</description>

      <description>What a relief, to get out of that house.
Ordinarily, Jude would have scoffed at his father’s request to purchase farming equipment from the next city – a three-day journey! But ever since Ethan, that rascal (you might even say that prodigal) brother of his, had returned, Jude could not stand to be in either man’s presence for long.
So he relished the chance to forget about his family tension on this farming errand.</description>

In the fourth century, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatius&#34;&gt;Chromatius&lt;/a&gt; described these babies as the first martyrs of Christ – the first counted worthy to die on Christ’s behalf. Around the same time, St. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo&#34;&gt;Augustine&lt;/a&gt; claimed that these nameless victims, “&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;whom Herod’s cruelty tore as sucklings from their mothers’ bosom are justly hailed as the infant martyr flowers, the first buds of the church killed by the frost of persecution. They died not only for Christ but in his stead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Today is December 28 (2014) – just the third day since Christmas – a commemoration of what is often called “The Slaughter of the Innocents,” the killing of the baby boys of Bethlehem by King Herod.
The Church’s regard for this day as a feast day is quite early, going back to at least the fifth century.</description>

      <description>Karl Barth&amp;rsquo;s exegesis of Christ&amp;rsquo;s wilderness temptations isperenniallyinspiring, but particularly poignant during this season of Lent.
What does it mean for Christ to be the Perfect Penitent? And how should this influence our own repentance?
The following series of quotations comes from a lengthy small-print section in CD IV/1, 259-73 (§ 59 The Obedience of the Son of God; 2. The Judge Judged in Our Place). There Barth walks through the three wilderness temptations before masterfully connecting them to Christ&amp;rsquo;s experience in the Garden of Gethsemane.</description>

He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus&amp;rsquo; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christ&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread&#34;&gt;first temptation was to turn stones into bread&lt;/a&gt;, thereby using divine power as a &amp;ldquo;technical instrument&amp;rdquo; to save and maintain his own life. Today&amp;rsquo;s temptation contains an incisive critique of Christendom&amp;rsquo;s desire for influence, relevance, and power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The &lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3&#34;&gt;sermon audio is now online&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve got 23 minutes to spare, &lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3&#34;&gt;give it a listen&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts.php?id=25&#34;&gt;here are the passages&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Psalm 121&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Genesis 12:1-4&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Romans 4:1-5, 13-17&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;John 3:1-17&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, make sure to &lt;strong&gt;ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stpetersbhm.org/wp-content/podcast/03-16-14JoshSteele.mp3&#34;&gt; in the audio&lt;/a&gt;, I departed from my notes — which ended at “Nicodemus then fades from the narrative,” (which he does in the passage at hand) — and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again. As I was quickly reminded after the service, &lt;strong&gt;he does appear twice more in John’s Gospel&lt;/strong&gt;. Oops! Next time I’ll stick to my notes and not make any extemporaneous comments about minor characters without thinking through the context first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First, here are the passages:
Psalm 121 Genesis 12:1-4 Romans 4:1-5, 13-17 John 3:1-17 Then, make sure to ignore my two seconds of speech from 16:35-16:37 in the audio, I departed from my notes — which ended at “Nicodemus then fades from the narrative,” (which he does in the passage at hand) — and said that Nicodemus apparently never gets it and never shows up again.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION: THE NATURE OF SCRIPTURE As the illocutionary act which testifies to the Son of God1 as the ultimate redemptive and revelatory locution of the the triune God, Scripture is used by the Spirit of God to accomplish the perlocutionary end of redemption of, in, and through the people of God.2 [Ahem, in order to understand my first paragraph, you must first be familiar with the basics of Speech Act Theory.</description>

Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;address&gt;Update (April 2017): I’ve gone back to update/clean-up the formatting in this wonderful June 2013 guest post on the basics of inductive Bible study from my friend **Amy Elizabeth Chase Ashley,** one of the most gifted students of Scripture with whom I’ve been privileged to study. She blogs at &lt;https://amyechase.wordpress.com/&gt;. &lt;/address&gt;---&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;jeremiah-2911&#34;&gt;Jeremiah 29:11&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I accepted the invitation to speak at my parents’ church, I immediately started thinking about what message I would deliver. I decided to give a message on something that is very important to me after my four years at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedarville.edu/&#34;&gt;Cedarville&lt;/a&gt; and something I am very passionate about. I hope it will be &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;engaging&lt;/span&gt;; I hope it will &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;make you think&lt;/span&gt;; and I hope it will &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;bring glory to God&lt;/span&gt;. If I can accomplish those three things, I will be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions.[\[1\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1) The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple.[\[2\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2) Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17).&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation.&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4&#34;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20).&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5&#34;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; (poievw).&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6&#34;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God’s creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The following is an attempt, written in 2012, to distill and paraphrase the main argument/message/story/logic of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.
Romans 1:1-17 If you don’t catch anything else from what I’m about to say, remember this:
God is righteous. He is just. He is faithful.
God has proven himself faithful to his promises of restoring the world, working through his faithful Son, the Messiah, to bring about both our faith in and our faithfulness to him.</description>
