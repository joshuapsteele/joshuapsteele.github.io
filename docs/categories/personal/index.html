        10 Things I Love About My Kids
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Lest <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/i-love-my-kids-but-i-sometimes-regret-having-them/">my previous parenting post</a> suggest that things are all doom-and-gloom at the Steele-haus, here are 10 things I love about my kids.</p>
<ol>
<li>I got to baptize all 3 of them as babies, a poignant reminder that they are beloved children of God.</li>
<li>They all love books, which warms my nerdy heart.</li>
<li>The way Eleanor (1yo) greets me. It used to be a very excited squeal. Now it’s “Ah! Daddy!”</li>
<li>Andrew (4yo) has a great memory for stories, especially Bible stories. I was redoing our fire pit, and spraying it with a hose to cut down on dust as I re-leveled the ground. Andrew: “Elijah put water on the fire, too!” (see 1 Kings 18).</li>
<li>Eva (6yo) is smart as a whip. She asks great questions, and I’m looking forward to (re-)learning with her as she gets older.</li>
<li>Eleanor’s recently learned how to do an overly-exaggerated “angry eyebrows” face, and I find it absolutely hilarious. She now does it to get a laugh.</li>
<li>Andrew loves Spiderman, and he goes back-and-forth on whether or not he thinks superheroes are real. Listening to him as he narrates Spiderman scenarios while running around in his Spiderman costume is always entertaining.</li>
<li>Eva will sometimes read books to Andrew and Eleanor. They will then imitate her–Andrew, by reciting stories from memory as he turns through the books, and Eleanor, by babbling to herself as she flips the pages.</li>
<li>I can get them all to watch things with me like This Old House, DIY videos, tool reviews, etc. Partially because they’re all curious and enjoy learning about tools. Partially (OK, mostly) because they’re thankful they’re watching *something* on the TV.</li>
<li>They’re all still young enough that they frequently want hugs and snuggles.</li>
</ol>

      <p>I love my kids, but I sometimes regret having them.</p>
<p>Pardon the clickbait-y title and opening sentence. But are we parents allowed to say that? Are we allowed to feel both of those things at once?</p>
<p>We’ve got a 6-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an almost-2-year-old. And, no, I don’t actually begrudge them their existence! I want what’s best for their lives and futures. And don’t get me wrong; <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/10-things-i-love-about-my-kids/">there are moments of laughter, poignancy, joy, etc.</a></p>

        Know Thyself: Unveiling Your Unique Strengths and Personality Traits

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>In the quest for personal and professional growth, understanding our unique strengths and personality traits can be incredibly enlightening. Today, I want to share my insights from various personality paradigms and how they shape my approach to work and life.</p>
<h2 id="cliftonstrengths-harnessing-core-talents">CliftonStrengths: Harnessing Core Talents</h2>
<p>The CliftonStrengths assessment has been instrumental in identifying my core talents. Here are my top five strengths:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input</strong>: I have an insatiable curiosity and a constant desire to collect information. This strength fuels my drive to learn and gather knowledge from diverse sources.</li>
<li><strong>Intellection</strong>: My love for deep thinking and intellectual discussions is a hallmark of this strength. It allows me to explore complex ideas and engage in thoughtful analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Learner</strong>: The process of learning excites me. Whether it’s acquiring new skills or understanding new concepts, I thrive in environments that offer continuous growth.</li>
<li><strong>Ideation</strong>: Creativity and innovation are my playgrounds. I enjoy brainstorming and generating new ideas, which often leads to novel solutions and approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Analytical</strong>: I have a keen ability to dissect problems and examine them from different angles. This strength helps me make informed decisions based on solid data and evidence.</li>

        Finding a Hat for My Big, Bald Head

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I’ve been on a lifelong journey to find hats that will fit my big ol’ head. Now that I’m bald, and the summer months are approaching, I figured it would be good to find one or two more hats to add to my rotation.</p>
<p>I’ve narrowed this round down to trying the following hats, in case you’re interested (Amazon affiliate links below):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TOO SMALL FOR ME</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/3xVZv3O">Carhartt Men’s Rugged Professional Series Canvas Mesh-Back Cap</a> (Shadow, One Size)</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Wi6GgS">Carhartt Men’s 100289 Odessa Ball Cap</a> (Carhartt Brown, One Size)
<ul>
<li>I’m a sucker for Carhartt and Carhartt brown!</li>
<li>This hat is comfortable</li>
<li>I like that it looks different than my other hats, which tend to be black, gray, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3UzLvWa">Ankor Ultra Performance Water-Resistant UPF 50 Baseball Hat</a> (Charcoal Gray, One Size)
<ul>
<li>Charcoal gray is my favorite color (not sure what that says about me…)</li>
<li>I really like the look and fit of this one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3xLtY4j">Flexfit Men’s Delta Seamless Cap</a> (Dark Grey, XX-Large)
<ul>
<li>Love the look and color of this</li>
<li>Very comfortable!</li>
<li>I wonder if it’s a tad *too* big for my head, though</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4aI6v2F">Flexfit Mens Cool &amp; Dry Sport</a> (Grey, X-Large-XX-Large)
<ul>
<li>This hat gets here in the mail today! I’m excited to try it out</li>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I know I’m not alone in this, but the past few years have been pretty rough for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve gained at least 50 pounds.</li>
<li>I had a fun part-time gig as a managing editor come to an end.</li>
<li>I’ve come to terms with some <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/its-time-to-get-some-help/">long-term depression and anxiety</a>.</li>
<li>I had a job offer ripped out from under me.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/its-official-im-hitting-pause-on-my-ph-d-for-a-year/">hit pause</a> on and eventually dropped out of my Ph.D. program.</li>
<li>I’ve <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/im-resigning-from-ordained-ministry-in-the-anglican-church-in-north-america/">resigned from ordained ministry in the ACNA</a>, my previous denomination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, some things have gone well. I’ve got a loving wife (who’s a superhero) and three healthy children. I’ve got a new career (as a software developer) that I very much enjoy. We’ve got a roof over our heads. I make more money now than I ever have.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>After a considerable period of discernment, coupled with my growing disaffection with the Anglican Church in North America, I sense God calling me to step away from ordained ministry in the ACNA and instead to focus on my family and my career as a software engineer.</p>
<p>This also coincides with plans to move closer to family in NW Ohio (where there is not much of an ACNA presence to speak of) and to then pursue church involvement outside of the ACNA.</p>

        Life Lessons: 32 Things I&#39;ve Learned So Far
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Here are 32 things I’ve learned from life, so far.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are not your thoughts. There is a “you” behind and above your inner voice/monologue/dialogue. Pay attention to what you pay attention to. Think about what you think about.</li>
<li>We always only have the present moment. Focusing too much on the future leads to anxiety. Focusing too much on the past leads to depression. Wherever you are, be fully there, now! (Read <a href="https://amzn.to/400hFeH"><em>The Power of Now</em> by Eckhart Tolle</a> [affiliate link here and throughout] for more on this.)</li>
<li>It’s OK not to be OK. Feeling anxious, depressed, angry, etc. is fine. However, avoid the trap of feeling anxious about how anxious you feel, feeling depressed about how depressed you feel, etc. (Learned this from <a href="https://amzn.to/404talb"><em>The Happiness Trap</em> by Russ Harris</a>.)</li>
<li>If you never make mistakes, you’re not learning/growing as well as you could be. Perfectionism is a deadly prison. Break free with “good enough” and “always learning.”</li>
<li>You are stronger than you think you are. You are weaker than you think you are.</li>
<li>Ask more questions. Ask better questions.</li>
<li>God is not a thing among things. There is an “infinite qualitative difference” between God and everything that is not God, everything that exists.</li>
<li>Jesus of Nazareth is the living Lord of all. ___ is not.</li>
<li>Beware of overconfidence in what the Bible (or any other sacred text, for that matter) “clearly”does or does not say.</li>
<li>God is devoted to the poor and powerless. Those who speak and act on God’s behalf should speak and act <em>for</em> the poor and powerless.</li>
<li>To do better with people, ask them questions about themselves. (Read the classic <a href="https://amzn.to/3QlSsrR"><em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> by Dale Carnegie</a>.)</li>
<li>You can’t out-exercise your appetite forever. <a href="https://amzn.to/4018XfY">Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much.</a></li>
<li>Get enough sleep. You probably don’t get enough sleep.</li>
<li>Lift heavy things.</li>
<li>Go outside. Take a walk.</li>
<li>Open a Roth IRA. Invest consistently in low-cost mutual funds or lifecycle funds as soon as you can. (Learned this from <a href="https://amzn.to/48Uc65D"><em>I Will Teach You to Be Rich</em> by Ramit Sethi</a>.)</li>
<li>Reading is a superpower. You can learn from as many other lives and lifetimes as you want. <a href="https://amzn.to/46YrOdW">Learn how to read</a>. Then <a href="https://amzn.to/46Dgm7J">learn how to learn.</a> Then, learn whatever you want!</li>
<li>Always read with a pen or pencil in your hand. If you really want to learn from a book, buy a physical copy and annotate the heck out of it.</li>
<li>You always have to earn and keep your audience’s attention. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “Why should they care? What’s in it for them?”</li>
<li>Humans are incredibly good at misunderstanding each other. Before/while communicating, ask yourself “How might I be misunderstood? How might I be misunderstanding others?”</li>
<li>Remember that you and your loved ones are all going to die. What do you want to be known for?</li>
<li>Eulogize people BEFORE they die.</li>
<li>Everyone should go to therapy for at least a few months.</li>
<li>“Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.” Feeling nervous/stressed/angry/etc.? SLOW DOWN, especially if you’re in front of other people.</li>
<li>Courage is a choice, not a feeling. No matter how nervous you are, you can always ACT courageously.</li>
<li>Everyone is trying to figure it out as they go along. Do you often feel like an imposter? Join the club!</li>
<li>Act like you’ve been here before. Act like you’ve done this before. Act calm, comfortable, and confident, if for no other reason than to help the people around you feel calm, comfortable, and confident.</li>
<li>Leadership is service. Leadership is the willingness to make a decision for the good of the group even when it’s awkward or uncomfortable to do so.</li>
<li>Focus on what you can control.</li>
<li>Journal. What do you really want? What are you afraid of? What’s the most important thing you need to get done today? Get a notebook and write it down!</li>
<li>In many domains, 80% of the outcomes/effects come from 20% of the inputs/causes. Find the “vital few” things that have outsized impacts, both positive and negative, on your life. Double-down on what’s helping you. Get rid of what’s hurting you.</li>
<li>Use smoked paprika. You’re welcome.</li>

        My Coding Bootcamp Journey: How a Pastor Became a Programmer

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>When I changed my major from Mechanical Engineering to Bible shortly before my first semester of college, I realized that what I was studying was not going to make me rich.</p>
<p>So, throughout undergrad, seminary, and into a Ph.D. program in theology, the notion of “bi-vocational ministry” (serving the church while also making money outside of the church doing something else) was on my radar screen.</p>
<p>In fact, for a few months between finishing seminary and starting my Ph.D. program, I tried to teach myself the basics of web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Ruby on Rails. (I signed up for an account on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> and on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> and I got to work!)</p>

      <p>This is, admittedly, a half-baked opinion. However, I need to get back in the habit of blogging/writing regularly, so here goes.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the use of the sign of the cross in clergy names/signatures—unless it’s done in official ecclesiastical communication or immediately after a blessing or prayer for the recipient—is pretentious. It’s showy. At the very least, it conveys or connotes pretentiousness.</p>
<p>Note that I’m not making a claim about the *people* who use crosses in their signatures, their inner thoughts, or their intentions. For all I know, every single clergyperson out there says a prayer of blessing for their recipients every single time they use the sign of the cross in a signature. I’m also not writing this about any person in particular.</p>

      <p>After realizing just how easy it was to lose access to the physical books that I own (now sequestered in my library carrel at Wheaton), on a bit of a whim <a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/573962246651661/">I created a fundraiser to help my upgrade my Logos Bible Software library</a> to either the Anglican Gold ($216) or Anglican Platinum ($582) libraries.</p>
<p>Upgrading would help me in my preaching, teaching, and writing roles (as a pastor-theologian and as the Managing Editor of AnglicanCompass.com). I’ve already benefited immensely from the Anglican Silver package I bought when I got into the Logos Bible Software ecosystem a couple years ago (mainly to gain easy digital access to Barth and Bonhoeffer’s writings for my dissertation). I plan to stick with Logos—especially for biblical commentaries, systematic theologies, and reference works—because it allows me to quickly research, prepare for sermons, answer questions from readers, etc.</p>

However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.</p>

      <p>Last night, the scale read 192.4. I’d really like it to read 180 or less.</p>
<p>So, in lieu of how effective <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/help-me-stickk-to-my-writing-habit/">putting money on the line via StickK</a> has been for my daily writing habit these past two weeks, I’ve decided to put money on the line as motivation to stick to the Slow Carb Diet for a month.</p>
<p>For my writing habit, I’ve committed to writing 500 words toward my dissertation every day for 8 weeks. For every week I’m unsuccessful, $35 goes to the NRA. (I’m a pacifist. I do not like the NRA.)</p>

<p>After a lengthy induction and labor, our beautiful daughter, Eva Joy Steele, was born at 5:46am on Friday, July 20, 2018.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Getting Things Done (“GTD” for short) is a wildly popular personal productivity system invented and popularized by David Allen. However, as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/getting-things-done-ten-years-in-1795707084">Nicole Dieker at Lifehacker pointed out in 2017</a>, “You don’t hear a lot of people talk about the <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> productivity system anymore.”</p>
<p>I think that’s a shame, because it’s a very effective system.</p>
<p>I first tried Getting Things Done after reading “<a href="http://amzn.to/2tMiX1w">What’s Best Nex</a>t” by Matt Perman, and then reading “<a href="http://amzn.to/2HvNJxv">Getting Things Done</a>” by David Allen (in its newly revised 2015 edition) shortly thereafter.</p>

      <p>I was recently privileged to see one of my favorite bands, <a href="http://theohhellos.com/">The Oh Hellos</a>, in concert at the House of Blues in downtown Chicago.</p>
<p>I love all of The Oh Hellos’ music, but one song, in particular, has remained poignant to me ever since I first heard it. The song is called “The Truth is a Cave,” and I think it provides a beautiful picture of what I’m calling “the theological journey” – the stages one goes through in one’s knowledge of God.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition is staggering. The funeral of the man I most associate with laughter and joy. It hurts. No Steele family gathering was complete without hearing his boisterous laugh, receiving one of his legendary bear hugs, and – if you were lucky – getting one heck of a sloppy kiss on the cheek.</p>

<p>“Dear friends,</p>
<p>“Every. Single. Week. I am contacted by people who attend and work at CU who are just miserable. I pray about what to say and what not to say; my motives aren’t malicious. This morning I was reading about Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and how he couldn’t believe that the Christians in Germany remained silent about Hitler or actively conspired with Hitler to get rid of the Jews. This situation at CU is no Germany. But faculty and staff at the school I loved are now forced into silence. They’re being oppressed. If they speak, they’ll lose their jobs. Their FB accounts and e-mails are monitored. A coup occurred at CU as it did at Southern Seminary, Southwestern Seminary, and Southeastern Seminary at the hands of Paige Patterson. Paige Patterson is now a trustee and mentor to the new president, Dr. White. Many who made decisions who fought to keep us and our friends (Bible profs/Carl Ruby and others) at the school told us that it was a coup. So the current administration doesn’t care about what fac/staff think. And students are there temporarily so….The chair of the board has said that he is willing to take the school down to 1200 to get their way. Shawn and I can afford to speak up because we didn’t sign a non-disclosure agreement. We are thriving and not bitter. But, I do get angry about how people are being treated. Thank God Shawn got a job right away and didn’t have to worry about providing for his family. Every single person who knows me will tell you I deliberate about my words. I am tired of the pain people are going through. And so I speak up because I can. I think this is the last chance for those currently there to give an outcry. Otherwise it’s over for them. They have moved to forbid egalitarians from teaching there, too. Next year, if you cannot say you are comp, you cannot work there. Only money and power can accomplish such a coup. I have no money or power. But, I have the freedom to speak up. So this below is just more evidence of what is going on. Students pray for your professors and staff. Many are suffering and can’t even tell you. Many of their jobs are on the line. They continue to clean house while silencing people. Pay attention to who is no longer there and from where they hire their new faculty. I’ve lost count of who is gone. People have to decide whether or not they’ll feed their families or speak up. So please, speak up on their behalf!</p>

<p>Our goal is to assist <a href="http://www.abweperu.org/page_family/pagefamily.php?id=12">the Stone families</a> (Dave &amp; Evelyn; Jonathan &amp; Angela) in their various local ministries, including:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.centroprenatal.org/">Vida Nueva Centro Prenatal</a> (Pregnancy Center)</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of Beeson’s required Cross Cultural Ministry Practicum is to “<em>expose students to issues related to cross-cultural ministry through first-hand experience in a cross-cultural ministry setting</em>.” In addition to fulfilling this goal, we believe that this trip to Peru will be <strong>influential in determining the future involvement of both our families in global missions</strong>. God’s given each of us unique gifts — ranging from medicine to math, theology to linguistics. But <strong>He’s blessed us all with a heart for His global Gospel and his global Church</strong>.</p>

      <p>DISCLAIMER: there’s a fair bit about the Church that frustrates me.</p>
<p>However, I’d like to address those frustrations in a way that builds bridges, not burns them down. Especially since sin and justice are both relational. It does no good to flee the former for the latter in a way that creates more rifts than it heals.</p>
<p>Therefore, any criticisms I level against my sisters and brothers in Christ, (many of those criticisms coming from outside the walls of the Church), I’d like first to aim them at myself. After all, if I want to witness self-righteous pride, xenophobia, misplaced anger, etc., I need look no further than the mirror.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: I’ve been blogging in order to raise awareness of Cedarville University’s recent dismissal of Dr. Michael Pahl from his teaching post. Using the University’s statement on Dr. Pahl, I’ve raised some uncomfortable questions that I believe need to be asked in this situation. For example:</p>

<h1 id="further-questions-all-relating-to-the-university-statement-on-dr-pahls-dismissal">Further Questions, All Relating to the University Statement on Dr. Pahl’s Dismissal:</h1>
<ul>
<li>If Dr. Pahl’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270"><em>The Beginning and the End</em></a>, was controversial enough to lead to his dismissal, why was the book allowed to be used as a textbook last school year?
<ul>
<li>Shouldn’t we trust the Bible professors’ judgment in their selection of the book as a text?</li>
<li>If we should, then was it worth firing Dr. Pahl over a book which other CU professors approved of enough to require as a text for their courses?</li>
<li>If not, why not? Why don’t we trust these highly-trained men and women as an institution? Shouldn’t they be a resource instead of a feared danger? Does this potential fear have anything to do with Dr. Pahl being dismissed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do all members of the Board of Trustees agree with “each and every position of Cedarville University’s Doctrinal Statement” in the way Dr. Pahl was expected to in order to still be allowed to teach?
<ul>
<li>If he was dismissed, despite the apparent alignment of his personal views and those expressed in his writing to the Doctrinal Statement, is there a possibility that some of the trustees should also be dismissed according to such strict standards?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was Dr. Pahl dismissed for something that wrote which contradicts the Doctrinal Statement? If so, what was it exactly that he wrote? (I have been unable to find anything in <em>The Beginning and the End</em>)</li>
<li>If Dr. Pahl was not fired for something he wrote, was he fired for something that he <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>didn’t</em> </span>write? Again, if so, what was it exactly that he didn’t affirm?</li>
<li>Furthermore, is firing someone for not affirming something fair? Are all professors required to affirm the Doctrinal Statement in its entirety in everything they write and/or publish?</li>
<li>What is the administration’s vision for the future of the Bible Department at Cedarville University?</li>
<li>How does firing an orthodox, promising scholar who is committed to Scripture and to the gospel help to achieve that vision?</li>
<li>Has Dr. Pahl been cared for by the University in any way during this process? As our brother in Christ, have we dismissed him in a way that is honoring to God and helpful to him and his family?</li>
<li>What explanation has been given to the students who have been affected by Dr. Pahl’s dismissal (i.e. the ones registered for his classes)? Has that explanation been accurate and forthright?</li>
<li>Are any other professors currently being considered for dismissal by the University for things they have written and published?</li>
</ul>

<p>“Dr. Michael Pahl has been relieved of his teaching duties because he is unable to concur fully with each and every position of<a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/About/Doctrinal-Statement.aspx"> Cedarville University’s doctrinal statement</a>. This decision was made following a review by the University administration and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/Board-of-Trustees.aspx">trustees</a> prompted by Dr. Pahl’s recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Beginning-End-Rereading-Revelations/dp/1608999270">The Beginning and the End: Rereading Genesis’s Stories and Revelation’s Visions.</a></p>
<p>Dr. Pahl’s orthodoxy and commitment to the gospel are not in question, nor is his commitment to Scripture’s inspiration, authority and infallibility. He is a promising scholar and a dedicated teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and students. Nevertheless, the University has determined this decision to be in the best interests of its constituency at this time.”</p>

      <p>Undoubtedly the title of this blog post could be taken in hundreds of different directions. However, given recent developments close to home, and <a href="http://www.cedarville.edu/Offices/Public-Relations/CampusNews/2012/Cedarville-to-Host-Answers-in-Genesis-Conference.aspx">the Answers in Genesis conference coming to Cedarville University on Sept. 23-24</a>, I’d like to get people thinking about Ken Ham, his organization’s agenda, and <strong>how Scripture might very well be getting abused for the sake of Young Earth Creationism</strong>.</p>
<p>I say this as someone who used to be a zealous defender of everything that Answers in Genesis stands for. I viewed the Creationism vs. Evolution debate as central and foundational to the Christian life. I would sit for hours on end and listen to guys like Kent Hovind and their defenses of Young Earth Creationism…</p>
