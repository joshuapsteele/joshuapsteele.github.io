      <p>The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election. Back then, I was just a high school student, but these themes have stuck with me ever since.</p>
<p>(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)</p>

      <p>With Holy Week and Easter coming up, I’ve been thinking about music and artwork that I’ve found particularly poignant when reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
<p>First, I’ve seen many icons of the resurrection (“anastasis,” in Greek) like the one below.</p>
<p>But I don’t think I fully appreciated the image until I realized it was Adam and Eve that Christ is helping up out of their graves. He’s trampled down the doors/gates of Hell and is taking an elderly Adam and an elderly Eve by the hand. Rescuing them from the realm of Death, in order to bring them back to eternal life with God.</p>

<p>Many churches in the USA are too “busy.” They are trying to do too many different things and should instead refocus on the church’s proper priorities (Word and Sacraments).</p>

      <p>For a research project, I’m looking for examples of the reasoning that goes into what’s been called, among other things</p>
<ul>
<li>“theological triage,”</li>

<li>“dogmatic rank.”</li>

<p>I’m referring to the process of distinguishing between various levels of importance when it comes to theological statements/positions.</p>
<p>So, for example, the Trinity would usually be considered a “first-order” or “primary” doctrine—a “dogma,” if you will. But a specific view of the end times would usually be considered a “second-order,” “secondary,” or “tertiary” doctrine—AKA “adiaphora.”</p>

The great crisis in which all worship and piety and adoration and prayer and theology constantly finds itself derives of course from the question whether and how far in these things we really have to do with the true and living God who reveals Himself in His Word, and not with an idol. But this question is decided concretely in practice by another one which is inseparable from it—whether and how far in these things we come before God together and not apart from and against one another. True Christianity cannot be a private Christianity, i.e., a rapacious Christianity. Inhumanity at once makes it a counterfeit Christianity.

      <p><em>UPDATE: Here is the paper that I gave at the 2019 Karl Barth Graduate Student Colloquium at the Center for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction-gentiles--world-is-worse-than-israel--church">INTRODUCTION: “GENTILES” = “WORLD” IS WORSE THAN “ISRAEL” = “CHURCH”</h2>
<p>On at least one level, Karl Barth’s Römerbrief reading of Romans 9–11 is supersessionist. In general, especially in the second edition, when Paul refers to “Israel” in Romans 9–11, Barth refers to the “Church.”<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-1">[1]</a></sup></sup> He replaces Israel with the Church. That’s supersessionism, case closed. Right? Well, yes and no. It has become increasingly common to at least mitigate or nuance the charge of supersessionism against Barth’s reading of Romans 9–11. Various scholars have broadly argued that, yes, Barth’s handling of Romans 9–11 at least leaves the door open for at least a certain kind of supersessionism, but, no, he wasn’t being quite as careless with Israel as it might initially seem.<sup><sup><a href="#post-41871-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> By and large, I agree with these assessments. Barth should have said more about the actual people and history of Israel, but he wasn’t trying to merely displace Israel with the Church, as if the latter were superior and the former were forgotten. He was trying to bring Israel and the Church together in solidarity, in opposition to the arrogance of the Church.</p>

<p>Granted, I don’t have to solve all of the exegetical issues (of which there are many) in Romans 9:30–10:21. I just have to make some sense of what <em>Barth</em> thought about the passage.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-thy-kingdom-haswill-come">Introduction: “Thy Kingdom [Has/Will] Come”?</h2>
<p>Just how <em>eschatological</em> is the Lord’s Prayer (=LP; Matt. 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4), particularly in light of its second petition, “Your kingdom come” (ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου, Matt. 6:10a; Luke 11:2d)? In other words, when will God’s kingdom come? Has it already arrived (not eschatological)? Is it in the process of arriving? Or will it arrive at some point in the future (eschatological)? Furthermore, who brings the kingdom about? Humans? God? Or some combination of the two? Settling the question of eschatology involves both the timing and the agency, the <em>when</em> and the <em>who</em>, of the kingdom.</p>

<p>I don’t own a copy, so every time I have to consult BDAG I think “I really should buy this.” But for the past decade or so, primarily because of BDAG’s cost ($150 on Logos, $130 used on Amazon, $165 new on Amazon) I’ve held off.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’m seeking to build my “must-have” personal reference library to sustain a ministry as a pastor theologian. So, I think I need to buy BDAG sometime soon.

<p>Title: “The Four Types of Priesthood in the New Testament: On Avoiding Confusions about What ‘Priesthood’ Means”</p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey Turner</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian discourse tends to treat the concept of ‘priesthood’ univocally, so that ordained priests are seen to share the priesthood of Christ. But a careful reading of Hebrews shows clearly that the priesthood of Christ is unique to him. There are four (even five) types of priest in the New Testament and each of them is distinct and not to be confused.</p>

      <p>I became an “egalitarian” in college, before I became an Anglican in seminary.</p>
<p>It’s taken some time for me to get used to the different contours of the women’s ordination debate within Anglicanism. Growing up, the debate was all about particular Bible verses and whether or not women could teach and preach. However, in Anglicanism, although those same questions/arguments are present, I hear much more about whether or not women can administer the sacraments as priests.</p>

        8 Questions to Ask While Reading Theology
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>While reading Beth Felker Jones’ <a href="https://amzn.to/2vLkeEo"><em>Practicing Christian Doctrine: An Introduction to Thinking and Living Theologically</em></a>, I came across the following list of extremely helpful questions to ask while reading theology (on page 29).</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What are the key Christian teachings being articulated? What is the author’s driving concern or main theme?</li>
<li>What counts for the author as authoritative (Scripture, tradition, reason, experience…)? Is the author’s theological method implicit or explicit?</li>
<li>How does the author deal with the witness of Scripture?<br>
a. Implicitly? Explicitly?<br>
b. Does the witness of the Old Testament matter? The New?<br>
c. What biblical themes are privileged?<br>
d. What interpretive principles are at work?</li>
<li>How do these claims relate to other doctrines?</li>
<li>How does context (including gender, race, class, culture, and time) shape the theological voice? Is the theologian conscious of this? How does your context shape your evaluation of the piece?</li>
<li>Practice reading charitably. What is the best possible interpretation of how the piece reflects an attempt to be faithful to Jesus Christ?</li>
<li>How do these theological claims relate to the life of faith? Doe you bring other questions from your experience?</li>
<li>If this theological proposal were taken seriously, how would it shape Christian practice? Would it affect our participation in spiritual disciplines? Our understanding of faithful living? Our practice of evangelism? Our life as the church?</li>
</ol>

        What Theologians (Should) Do
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Kevin J. Vanhoozer, affectionately known by some as “KJV,” has written <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/08/letter-to-an-aspiring-theologian">one of the best, briefest overviews of what theologians (should) do</a>.</p>
<p>The entire piece is filled with gems like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To become a theologian, you must be willing to bear true witness and call out false witnesses, casting down idols and ideologies. That’s the shadow side of theology, but the best part is speaking light and truth in astonished indications of God’s goodness. I love John Webster’s definition of theology: “that delightful activity in which the Church praises God by ordering its thinking towards the gospel of Christ.” Being a theologian means getting to have not necessarily the last word, but the word about last things, “the end for which God created the world” (to cite the title of a dissertation by Jonathan Edwards). It’s not only a good word but the best of all possible words, namely, that God glorifies humans and all creation, magnifying his own glory and subjecting all things to the Lordship of Christ, so that “God may be all in all” (1 Cor. 15:28). It’s the privilege of the theologian to bear witness to the length, depth, breadth, and width of the cross and Resurrection. Karl Barth is right: “The theologian who has no joy in his work is not a theologian at all.”</p>

        What Attracts People to Anglicanism? Here&#39;s My Take

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Based upon my work over at <a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">Rookie Anglican</a>, I was asked by <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com/">The Telos Collective</a> to write a blog post about the different ways that people are coming into Anglicanism. What’s drawing them in?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com/what-attracts-people-to-anglicanism-subversive-cultural-resonance/">read my full post over at the Telos Collective blog</a>, but here’s a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anglican Christianity, precisely because of its weirdness, can remind us that, in the words of Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger in Exploring Ecclesiology, “The church is a cultural community. It is Christ’s eschatological kingdom community, itself a culture that engages other cultures from Christ’s kingdom vantage point” (p. 207).</p>

<p>Since that post, two other pieces about Jordan Peterson have been written that I’d like to share.</p>
<h1 id="jordan-peterson-custodian-of-the-patriarchy-by-nellie-bowles-new-york-times">“Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy,” by Nellie Bowles (New York Times)</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html">Nellie Bowles writes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Peterson, 55, a University of Toronto psychology professor turned YouTube philosopher turned mystical father figure, has emerged as an influential thought leader. The messages he delivers range from hoary self-help empowerment talk (clean your room, stand up straight) to the more retrograde and political (a society run as a patriarchy makes sense and stems mostly from men’s competence; the notion of white privilege is a farce). He is the stately looking, pedigreed voice for a group of culture warriors who are working diligently to undermine mainstream and liberal efforts to promote equality.</p>

<p>Theological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a> – human understanding and interpretation in light of the identity and acts of the triune God – faces two problematic questions that, I believe, every biblical and/or theological scholar must be prepared to address. First, should the Bible be read in some special sense as divine revelation, or should we read the Bible like any other text? And second, should biblical and theological studies be one discipline, or two?</p>

        Christians and Wealth: An Argument for Downward Mobility

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Great news! If you only have a minute to read about wealth, here’s my argument in a nutshell:</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="outline-of-my-argument">Outline of My Argument</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main Claim: American Christians should reduce their standards of living to what is necessary for human flourishing and give their excess resources beyond this standard to the poor and oppressed.</strong>
<ol>
<li>God is the firmest advocate for human flourishing.</li>
<li>The pursuit of wealth is spiritually dangerous and crippling.</li>
<li>Our culture’s inclinations toward upward financial mobility go against the message of the New Testament and the life of Christ.</li>
<li>God is revealed in Scripture to have a special concern for the poor and the oppressed.</li>
<li>Christians will be held accountable for how they treat the poor and the oppressed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Objections:
<ol>
<li>This line of reasoning is advocating asceticism and is unbiblical.</li>
<li>Christians have every right to keep what they have earned and to do what they wish with their excess funds.</li>
<li>Because the poor are lazy, Christians should not feel pressured to give, in case their generosity is taken advantage of.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Warrant:
<ol>
<li>Christians want to remain true to Scripture and submit to God’s way of life in order to find satisfaction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

      <p>Yesterday, I asked you <a href="http://frustrated">to join the Church if you, like me, are frustrated with the Church</a>. The strongest critiques of religion come from within, not without, the Christian community. Plus, your frustrations are likely shared by many others within the Church!</p>
<p>However, it’s not enough to point the finger at others from your pew, instead of doing so from the public square. Yes, that’s a good first step, but another one is necessary.</p>

      <p>Hi internet – especially all you Barthians and Bonhoefferians (-ites?) out there.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of compiling a reading list, and I could use your suggestions.</p>
<p>Here’s my goal: <strong>to explore the possible relationship between Barth’s critique of the “No-God”</strong>(Nich-Gott) <strong>and Bonhoeffer’s critique(s) of viewing God as a “stopgap”</strong> (Lückenbüßer) <strong>or “working hypothesis.”</strong></p>
<p>As far as primary sources go, I plan to focus on the <em>Romans</em> commentary, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098">Garrett Green’s recent re-translation of </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098"><em>CD</em></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Religion-The-Revelation-Sublimation/dp/0567031098"> §17</a>, and <em>Letters and Papers from Prison</em>.</p>

<p>From the church’s perspective, is the state a promising offer, or a threatening one? At the risk of breathtaking oversimplification, Anglicans have tended to adopt the former perspective, leading to accommodation, and Anabaptists the latter, resulting in separation.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Following Samuel Wells in his theological appropriation of terms from theatrical improvisation, the Anglican tradition has tended to respond to the promising <em>offers</em> (invitations to respond) of the state by <em>accepting</em> – maintaining the premise(s) of the state’s action(s).<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> The historical legacy of the Church of England has given Anglicanism, as Anderson notes, an “inheritance of a strong loyalty to the state and a conservatism that has led the church to promote the status quo more often than it agitates for reform.”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> This inheritance from the established Church of England has coincided with a dual tendency to adopt a high <em>status</em> (a strategy for getting one’s way), in terms of relative privilege and political optimism, and a low status, in terms of frequent subservience in church-state relations.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Just as sin is ontological impossibility, disunity is ecclesiological impossibility. The tension between the undeniable reality of sin and Karl Barth’s theological definition of sin as an impossible possibility parallels the tension between the obvious reality of a fractured church1 and the theological definition of the church as the one body of the one Christ. Two excerpts from the Barthian corpus legitimize this connection. First, in his prepared remarks to the 1937 Second World Conference on Faith and Order in Edinburgh, Karl Barth maintained that</p>

      <p><a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">Yesterday I posted the beginning of Karl Barth&rsquo;s exegesis of Christ&rsquo;s wilderness temptations</a>. He does a masterful job of explaining how Christ was tempted, not to violate the Law or commit a moral infraction, but to abandon his role as the obedient, Perfect Penitent. Put differently, Barth clarifies that Jesus&rsquo; sinlessness is not a vague moral perfection, but rather obedience and repentance.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/barth-on-the-wilderness-temptations-1-stones-into-bread">first temptation was to turn stones into bread</a>, thereby using divine power as a &ldquo;technical instrument&rdquo; to save and maintain his own life. Today&rsquo;s temptation contains an incisive critique of Christendom&rsquo;s desire for influence, relevance, and power.</p>

<p>Don DeLillo’s <em>White Noise</em>, “a paradigm of postmodern literature,”<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup> yields the kind of cognitive dissonance that makes you wonder whether the author simply missed the mark, or if you are only confused because you suffer from the postmodern condition which DeLillo adroitly analyzes.</p>

      <p>The past week has been a great one for slipshod attacks on pacifism. First, from <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/">First Things</a> (Stephen H. Webb) on October 15 —- <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/10/john-howard-yoder-and-the-violent-power-of-pacifism">“John Howard Yoder and the Violent Power of Pacifism”</a> (emphasis added below):</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, pacifists, at least the ones I know, can be very enthusiastic about the rightness of their cause. Since <span style="text-decoration:underline;">there is no rational justification for pacifism</span>, defenders typically turn their rhetoric against their critics by casting them as stooges of the status quo. Since pacifists are against all forms of violence, anyone who disagrees with them must be in favor of violence. What this ploy misses is obvious. In a fallen world, not only is violence pervasive but it is also a toxin that, when legitimately used, can cure as well as kill.</p>

<p>2.

<p>Gombis hits the nail on the head here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last several months, I’ve had several conversations about how the Gospels’ language about “the gospel” should shape how Christians conceive of the gospel. Whereas the New Testament mainly envisions a broader announcement of a larger reality, many evangelicals associate “the gospel” with a brief presentation, or information about the mechanics of an individual transaction that can secure divine forgiveness and the establishment of a personal relationship with God.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>This study of Romans 13 rests upon a crucial presupposition: without context, words can mean anything and everything, and therefore mean nothing. It is only through the delimiting influence of context that words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs are endowed with significance.</p>
<p>Although this concept seems simple and justified enough, it is often forgotten within the field of biblical exegesis. Due to influences as simple as our versification of the biblical text and as complex as the historical/theological developments which have dictated how we teach and interpret the Scriptures, many exegetes (wittingly or unwittingly) ignore context when trying to ascertain the meaning of particular biblical texts.</p>

<h1 id="creation-and-redemption-christ-and-new-creation">CREATION AND REDEMPTION: CHRIST AND NEW CREATION</h1>
<div>Throughout the New Testament, the main use of creation theology is to link creation with redemption, resulting in the praise of the Creator through the Creator-Redeemer, Jesus the Messiah. However, the linked concepts of creation and redemption have a rich OT history. For example, cited impetuses for keeping the Sabbath are Yahweh’s creative work (Exod 20:11) and his redemptive work (Deut 5:15), revealing a close connection between the two actions.[\[1\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1) The logic behind this correlation is one of continued creation: Yahweh is personally invested in the success of his creative purposes, the functionality of his temple.[\[2\]](/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2) Sin and Death will not have the final word. The Creator will redeem by creating anew through his Son.
<p>The New Testament unites creation and redemption in the person of Jesus the Messiah. Evidence abounds, but consider three poignant examples. In John 1:1-18, Jesus is spoken of as the agent of creation (1:3) and the redemptive agent of grace and truth (1:17).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> In Colossians 1:15-20, Jesus is the “image of God, the firstborn over all creation (1:15),” illustrating his role as the eternal nexus between Creator and creation.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn4">[4]</a> Furthermore, Christ is spoken of, again, as both the agent of creation (1:16) and reconciliatory redemption (1:19-20).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn5">[5]</a> Finally, in Heb 1:1-4, the author of Hebrews takes special care to link the Son’s creative work with his redemptive work through a verbal parallel: through the Son, the universe and redemptive cleansing are both <em>made</em> (poievw).<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>

<h1 id="creation-complexity-and-chaos">CREATION, COMPLEXITY, AND CHAOS</h1>
<p>Much of the chaos in the universe can be ascribed to the infiltration of Sin and Death as described in Genesis 3. However, an oft-overlooked facet of biblical creation theology is the appropriate place of complexity and chaos within God’s creation. Even when the effects of the Fall are ignored, God’s temple is by no means a tame environment, nor is humanity the sole venue through which Yahweh receives glory. This facet is a crucial one, for it reorients a proper view of worship in an untamed temple, necessitating humility in the worship of the Creator.</p>

      <h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>In many conservative evangelical circles, biblical creation theology has been hijacked and eclipsed by the vitriolic debate between Young Earth Creationism and Neo-Darwinism.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn1">[1]</a> It is often difficult to see beyond this morass the beautiful tapestry of creation themes in biblical theology. Waltke summarizes the problem well: “Instead of metaphysical questions that shape culture, questions about dinosaurs, a young earth theory, and such dominate the evangelical landscape. This is unfortunate.”<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn2">[2]</a> Nevertheless, there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to Scripture’s use of creation themes, whether the evangelical community gives them appropriate attention or not. Unfortunately, a comprehensive analysis of biblical creation theology, a field fertile enough to provide lifetimes of work and study, far exceeds the purview of this essay.<a href="/Users/Josh/Downloads/CREATION%20(2).docx#_ftn3">[3]</a> However, a brief analysis of the motifs of creation as temple, chaos, and redemption will show that the overarching use of creation theology in Scripture is to bring about the praise of the Creator. Biblical creation theology, properly understood, leads to doxology.</p>

<p>I have found that several of these carols go much deeper (much more biblical) than the personal salvation “gospel” of sin-management that we often preach and sing about. What’s tragic is that, even though these carols are quite possibly the best-known Christian songs, their familiarity (and the fact that we only break them out for 1/12th of the year), makes it quite easy to ignore their substance.</p>
