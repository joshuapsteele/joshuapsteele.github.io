<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="introducing-an-ongoing-debate"><strong>Introducing an Ongoing Debate</strong></h2>

<li>In other words, X believes $$$.</li>
<li>In making this comment, X argues that $$$.</li>
<li>X is insisting that $$$</li>
<li>X’s point is that $$$</li>
<li>The essence of X’s argument is that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disagreeing-with-reasons"><strong>Disagreeing, with Reasons</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>I think X is mistaken because she overlooks $$$</li>
<li>X’s claim that $$$ rests upon the questionable assumption that $$$.</li>
<li>I disagree with X’s view that $$$ because, as recent research has show, $$$</li>
<li>X contradicts herself /can’t have it both ways. On the one hand, she argues $$$, but on the other hand, she also says $$$</li>
<li>By focusing on $$$, X overlooks the deeper problem of $$$</li>
<li>X claims $$$, but we don’t need X to tell us that. Anyone familiar with $$$ has long know that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="agreeing-with-a-difference"><strong>Agreeing, with a Difference</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>I agree that $$$ because my experience confirms it.</li>
<li>X surely is right about $$$ because, as she may not be aware, recent studies have shown that $$$.</li>
<li>X’s theory of $$$ is extremely useful because it sheds insight on the difficult problem of $$$</li>
<li>I agree that $$$, a point that needs emphasizing since so many people believe $$$</li>
<li>Those unfamiliar with this school of thought may be interested to know that it basically boils down to $$$</li>
<li>If group X is right that $$$, as I think they are, then we need to reassess the popular assumption that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="agreeing-and-disagreeing-simultaneously"><strong>Agreeing and Disagreeing Simultaneously</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Although I agree with X up to a point, I cannot accept his overall conclusion that $$$</li>
<li>Although I disagree with much that X says, I fully endorse his final conclusion that $$$</li>
<li>Though I concede that $$$, I still insist that $$$</li>
<li>Whereas X provides ample evidence that $$$, Y and Z’s research on $$$ and $$$ convinces me that $$$ instead.</li>
<li>X is right that $$$, but she seems on more dubious ground when she claims that $$$</li>
<li>While X is probably wrong when she claims that $$$, she is right that $$$</li>
<li>I’m of two minds about X’s claim that $$$. On the one hand, I agree that $$$. On the other hand, I’m not sure if $$$</li>
<li>My feelings on the issue are mixed. I do support X’s positions that $$$, but I find Y’s argument about $$$ and Z’s research on $$$ to be equally persuasive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="signaling-who-is-saying-what"><strong>Signaling Who Is Saying What</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>X argues $$$</li>
<li>According to both X and Y, $$$</li>
<li>Politicians $$$, X argues, should $$$</li>
<li>Most athletes will tell you that $$$</li>
<li>My own view, however, is that $$$</li>
<li>I agree, as X may not realize, that $$$, but $$$ are real and, arguably, the most significant factor in $$$</li>
<li>However X is wrong that $$$</li>
<li>However, it is simply not true that $$$</li>
<li>Indeed, it is highly likely that $$$</li>
<li>Nonetheless, the view that $$$ does not fit all the facts.</li>
<li>X is right that $$$</li>
<li>X is wrong that</li>
<li>X is both right and wrong that $$$</li>
<li>A sober analysis of the matter reveals $$$</li>
<li>Nevertheless, new research shows $$$</li>
<li>Anyone familiar with $$$ should see that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="embedding-voice-markers"><strong>Embedding Voice Markers</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>X overlooks what I consider an important point about $$$</li>
<li>My own view is that what X insists is a $$$ is in fact a $$$</li>
<li>I wholeheartedly endorse what X calls $$$</li>
<li>These conclusions, which X discusses in $$$, add weight to the argument that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entertaining-objections"><strong>Entertaining Objections</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>At this point, I would like to raise some objections that have been inspired by the skeptic in me. She feels that I have been ignoring $$$., “$$$,” she says to me, “$$$.”</li>
<li>Thus far some readers may challenge the view that $$$. After all, many believe $$$. Indeed, my own argument that $$$ seems to ignore $$$ and $$$</li>
<li>Of course, many will probably disagree with the assertion that $$$</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Naming Your Nay Sayers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Here many $$$ would probably object that $$$</li>
<li>However/But $$$ would certainly take issue with the argument that $$$</li>
<li>$$$, of course, may want to question whether/dispute my claim that $$$</li>
<li>Nevertheless, both followers and critics of $$$ will probably argue that $$$</li>
<li>Although not all $$$ think alike, some of them will probably dispute my claim that $$$</li>
<li>$$$ are so diverse in their views that it’s hard to generalize about them, but some are likely to object on the grounds that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introducing-objections-informally"><strong>Introducing Objections Informally</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>However/But is my proposal realistic? What are the chances of its actually being adopted?</li>
<li>Yet is it always true that $$$? Is it always the case, as I have been suggesting, that $$$?</li>
<li>However, does the evidence cited prove conclusively that $$$?</li>
<li>“Impossible,” some will say. “You must be reading the research selectively.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="making-concessions-while-still-standing-your-ground"><strong>Making Concessions while Still Standing Your Ground</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Although I grant that $$$, I still maintain that $$$</li>
<li>Proponents of X are right to argue that $$$. But they exaggerate when they claim that $$$</li>
<li>While it is true that $$$, it does not necessarily follow that $$$</li>
<li>On the one hand, I agree with X that $$$. But on the other hand, I still insist that $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indicating-who-cares"><strong>Indicating Who Cares</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>$$$ used to think $$$, but recently (or within the past few decades) $$$ suggests that $$$</li>
<li>What his new research does, then, is correct the mistaken impression, held by many earlier researchers, that $$$</li>
<li>These findings challenge the work of earlier researchers, who tended to assume that $$$</li>
<li>Recent studies like these shed new light on $$$, which previous studies had not addressed.</li>
<li>Researchers have long assumed that $$$. For instance, one eminent scholar of cell biology, $$$ assumed in $$$, her seminal work on cell structures and functions, that fate cells $$$. As $$$ herself put it, “$$$.” Another leading scientist, $$$, argued that fat cells “$$$.” Ultimately, when it came to the nature of fat, the basic assumption was that $$$. But a new body of research shows that fat cells are far more complex and that $$$</li>
<li>If sports enthusiasts stopped to think about it, any of them might simply assume that the most successful athletes $$$. However, new research shows $$$.</li>
<li>These findings challenge $$$’s common assumptions that $$$</li>
<li>At first glance, teenagers appear to $$$, but on closer inspection $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="establishing-why-your-claims-matter"><strong>Establishing Why Your Claims Matter</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>X matters/is important because $$$</li>
<li>Although X may seem trivial, it is in fact crucial in terms of today’s concern over $$$</li>
<li>Ultimately, what is at stake here is $$$</li>
<li>These findings have important consequences for the broader domain of $$$</li>
<li>My discussion of X is in fact addressing the larger matter of $$$</li>
<li>These conclusions / This discovery will have significant application in $$$ as well as in $$$</li>
<li>Although X may seem of concern to only a small group of $$$, it should in fact concern anyone who cares about $$$</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-meta-commentary"><strong>Adding Meta-commentary</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>In other words, $$$</li>
<li>What $$$ really means by this is $$$</li>
<li>My point is $$$</li>
<li>Essentially, I am arguing that $$$</li>
<li>My point is not that we should $$$, but that we should $$$</li>
<li>What $$$ really means is $$$</li>
<li>In other words, $$$</li>
<li>To put it another way, $$$</li>
<li>In sum, then, $$$</li>
<li>My conclusion, then is that, $$$</li>
<li>In short, $$$</li>
<li>What is more important, $$$</li>
<li>Incidentally, $$$</li>
<li>By the way, $$$</li>
<li>Chapter two explores $$$, while Chapter three examines $$$</li>
<li>Having just argued that $$$, let us now turn our attention to $$$.</li>
<li>Although some readers may object that $$$, I would answer that $$$.</li>
