    <meta name="description" content="The relationship between Church and State, particularly the intersection of Christianity and politics, has been on my mind since I first started paying attention during the lead-up to the 2008 USA presidential election.

(For those curious, here’s a quick timeline: In 2012, I was studying biblical studies in college. By 2016, I was a seminarian, and in 2020, I was working on my Ph.D. in theology. Now, in 2024, I’m a software engineer! Yet political theology continues to weigh on my mind.)">

<p>As I’ve thought more about these topics, my reading list has grown, and I wanted to share it with you. It’s a mix of books I’ve read and some that are still on my to-read list. The first book that really shaped my thinking is <em><a href="https://amzn.to/43msglF">Resident Aliens</a></em>—a must-read if you’re interested in Christian political theology.</p>

<h3 id="abortion-specific-reads">Abortion-Specific Reads</h3>
<p>When it comes to abortion, I think it’s a tragedy that needs to be reduced, ideally through a consistent pro-life ethic. However, I’m also curious about progressive theological arguments for a pro-choice stance. Here are a few books I’m reading to explore those ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://amzn.to/4eh6V1f">Abortion and the Christian Tradition: A Pro-Choice Theological Ethic</a></em> by Margaret D. Kamitsuka</li>

<li><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3XmUCcW">Trust Women: A Progressive Christian Argument for Reproductive Justice</a></em> by Rebecca Todd Peters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="history-reading-list">History Reading List</h3>
<p>In addition to Christian political theology, I’ve also been diving into U.S. and world history, trying to get a better sense of where we’ve been and how it informs the present.</p>
