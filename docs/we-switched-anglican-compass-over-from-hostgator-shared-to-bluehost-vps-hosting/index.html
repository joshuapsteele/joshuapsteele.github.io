<p>What I would <em>really</em> love is for someone to sit down with me and give me a consultation on whether or not we’ve got things set up well for the following 3 websites on Bluehost:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://anglicancompass.com/">https://anglicancompass.com/</a> (this is our most important website right now, it gets the most traffic)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.leaderworks.org/">http://www.leaderworks.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://theevergreenproject.org/">https://theevergreenproject.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Until now, I’ve only been involved with the backend of <a href="https://anglicancompass.com/">Anglican Compass</a>, so I’m not really sure of the ins and outs of how the other 2 websites are set up on the backend. But these three projects are going to be associated going forward, and I’d like to make sure that we’re set up for future success as our numbers increase!</p>
