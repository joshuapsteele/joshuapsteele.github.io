<ol>
<li>What is the book (or books) you’ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?</li>
<li>What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)?</li>
<li>How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a “favorite failure” of yours?</li>
<li>If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it — metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions — what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If helpful, it can be someone else’s quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live your life by?)</li>
<li>What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)</li>
<li>What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?</li>
<li>In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?</li>
<li>What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the “real world”? What advice should they ignore?</li>
<li>What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?</li>
<li>In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?</li>
<li>When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)</li>
</ol>
