<p>Second, I’ve long appreciated “Death in His Grave” by John Mark McMillan as a reflection on the crucifixion and resurrection.</p>

<p>By John Mark McMillan</p>
<p>Though the Earth Cried out for blood<br>
Satisfied her hunger was<br>
Her billows calmed on raging seas<br>
For the souls on men she craved</p>
<p>Sun and moon from balcony<br>
Turned their head in disbelief<br>
Their precious Love would taste the sting<br>
Disfigured and disdained</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke with keys<br>
Of Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>So three days in darkness slept<br>
The Morning Sun of righteousness<br>
But rose to shame the throes of death<br>
And over turn his rule</p>
<p>Now daughters and the sons of men<br>
Would pay not their dues again<br>
The debt of blood they owed was rent<br>
When the day rolled a new</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke holding keys<br>
To Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>On Friday a thief<br>
On Sunday a King<br>
Laid down in grief<br>
But awoke with keys<br>
Of Hell on that day<br>
The first born of the slain<br>
The Man Jesus Christ<br>
Laid death in his grave</p>
<p>He has cheated<br>
Hell and seated<br>
Us above the fall<br>
In desperate places<br>
He paid our wages<br>
One time once and for all</p>
