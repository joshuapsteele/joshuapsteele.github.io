<p>I’m right there with you! That’s why I’ve made “<a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/category/productivity-and-time-management/">Get Your Act Together (Productivity and Time Management)</a>” the first of my <a href="https://joshuapsteele.com/start-here/">Steps to Find Purpose and Meaning in Life</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I think I’ve found something that can help. I’d like to introduce you to the “<strong>Pareto Principle</strong>,” also known as “<strong>the 80/20 Rule</strong>,” the “law of the vital few,” or the “principle of factor sparsity,” if you want to get all technical about it.</p>
<h3 id="put-as-simply-as-possible-the-8020-rule-says-this-80-of-effects-come-from-20-of-causes">Put as simply as possible, the 80/20 rule says this: 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.</h3>
<p>Take a moment to think about this, and it becomes obvious that the 80/20 principle is at play all over the place.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard someone say that 80% of the money/work in a church comes from just 20% of the congregation? 80% of sales come from 20% of clients? As long as you don’t get hung up on exact percentages and allow the principle to be a ballpark estimator/lens, you can see the Pareto Principle at work in several different areas of life, from agriculture to economics.</p>
<p>Here’s a helpful video if you’d like to learn more about the 80/20 Rule:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="422" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V28B_xOJzK4?start=51&feature=oembed" title="How to Instantly Be More Productive – The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch" width="750"></iframe>
<h3 id="performing-an-8020-analysis--determining-which-20-of-things-are-responsible-for-80-of-the-results">Performing an “80/20 Analysis” = Determining which 20% of things are responsible for 80% of the results.</h3>
<p>This works both positively and negatively. Right? 20% of the people you spend time with are responsible for 80% of the positive emotions and experiences. But 20% of the people you spend time with are also responsible for 80% of the negative emotions in your life.</p>
<p>20% of the things you spend your time doing are responsible for 80% of the outcomes – both positively and negatively.</p>
<p>This means that you can make some pretty drastic changes in your life by zeroing in on the correct 20%! Eliminating the bad 20% and focusing on increasing the good 20% can quickly turn your life around.</p>
<p>Doing an 80/20 analysis in various areas of your life can save you a bunch of time, because you’re maximizing your efforts by prioritizing the changes you make.</p>
<p>The 80/20 Rule is, therefore, understandably a pretty popular concept. (Google “80/20 Rule” and you’ll see what I mean!) If you’d like to learn more about it, consider picking up Richard Koch’s classic book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2BEFj3k">The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less</a>. (Heads up: that’s an affiliate link. If you end up buying that book, I earn a small commission, at no extra cost to you.)</p>
<p>However, I’m convinced that there are two reasons why Christians in particular should care about the 80/20 Principle.</p>
<h1 id="2-reasons-why-christians-should-care-about-the-8020-pareto-principle">2 Reasons Why Christians Should Care about the 80/20 Pareto Principle</h1>
<h2 id="1-it-could-be-deadly-to-your-christian-life">1. It could be deadly to your Christian life.</h2>
<p>That’s right, I think that, if it’s misused, the Pareto Principle can be deadly for your walk with God.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, if you allow “the world” to calibrate your 80/20 analysis, then you will end up frequently overlooking the things that God cares about — the things that God wants YOU to care about.</p>
<p>Do you think that loving your enemies, caring for the poor, turning the other cheek, and loving the unlovely are going to show up at the top of your 80/20 analysis if you’re not allowing your head and your heart to be shaped by the gospel – by the Good Story of God? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>So, Christians should care about the 80/20 Rule because, if we use it incorrectly, it might end up making us less effective for the Kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 id="2-it-could-change-your-christian-life-for-the-better">2. It could change your Christian life for the better.</h2>
<p>However, just because a principle can be misused doesn’t mean you should use it!</p>
<p>(Also, technically, the Pareto Principle is at work, even if you’re not choosing to capitalize on it! So, there’s no sense in ignoring it!)</p>
<p>As long as we allow our perspectives to be shaped by the Gospel, Christians can profitably use the 80/20 Principle to become more effective, healthy, and whole for the Kingdom of God. There’s no reason not to use this tool.</p>
<h1 id="performing-an-8020-analysis-on-your-christian-life">Performing an 80/20 Analysis on Your Christian Life</h1>
<p>Take advantage of the Pareto Principle by applying it to your walk with God. Think about it with me:</p>
<h3 id="what-20-of-people-things-and-habits-are-drawing-you-80-farther-away-from-god">What 20% of People, Things, and Habits are Drawing You 80% Farther Away from God?</h3>
<p>What people/places/things/actions are responsible for the vast majority of your spiritual decline?</p>
<p>Is it your phone? Social media? Pornography? An old friend who is clearly influencing you more in a negative direction than you’re influencing them in a positive direction?</p>
<p>You need to prioritize your time, your efforts, and your prayers to <strong>decreasing</strong> these things. Even taking just one of these “worst offenders” out of your life could make a huge difference.</p>
<h3 id="what-20-of-people-things-and-habits-are-drawing-you-80-closer-to-god">What 20% of People, Things, and Habits are Drawing You 80% Closer to God?</h3>
<p>What people/places/things/actions are responsible for the vast majority of your spiritual growth?</p>
<p>Is it going to church regularly? Getting up early to read your Bible and pray? Finding and spending time with a trusted spiritual mentor?</p>
<p>You need to prioritize your time, your efforts, and your prayers to <strong>increasing</strong> these things. Doing so will have an outsized impact on your spiritual life.</p>
<h3 id="remember-you-cant-do-this-alone">Remember, YOU Can’t Do This Alone</h3>
<p>No, of course, we can’t “fix ourselves” on our own!</p>
<p>We desperately need the life-transforming ministry of the Holy Spirit to make these kinds of changes in our lives. And God doesn’t love us based on how well we do an 80/20 analysis (praise God!).</p>
<p>But still, it helps to have a clearer idea of where to focus in terms of having a closer relationship with God and others. And I believe that the 80/20 Rule can help us get more clarity.</p>
<h1 id="coming-soon-an-8020-approach-to-productivity-time-management-bible-study-and-theology">Coming Soon: An 80/20 Approach to Productivity, Time Management, Bible Study, and Theology</h1>
<p>There’s another reason why I’m bringing up the 80/20 Rule. This principle will guide my future posts about</p>
<ul>
<li>Productivity</li>
<li>Time Management</li>
<li>Bible Study</li>
<li>Theology</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Because I’m not convinced that anyone needs to learn 100% or even 80% about these topics before they move forward. Attempting to do so will frequently lead to paralysis and indecision, instead of growth.</p>
<p>Instead, it pays off to begin with the most effective 20% of the information in each topic area. And that’s what I’m going to focus on in the weeks ahead.</p>
