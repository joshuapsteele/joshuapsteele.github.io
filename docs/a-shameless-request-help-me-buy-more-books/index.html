Upgrading would help me in my preaching, teaching, and writing roles (as a pastor-theologian and as the Managing Editor of AnglicanCompass.com). I’ve already benefited immensely from the Anglican Silver package I bought when I got into the Logos Bible Software ecosystem a couple years ago (mainly to gain easy digital access to Barth and Bonhoeffer’s writings for my dissertation).

<h2 id="within-a-single-day-the-fundraiser-received-341-that-leaves-just-241-to-reach-the-582-platinum-goal">Within a single day, the fundraiser received $341!! That leaves just $241 to reach the $582 Platinum goal!</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/573962246651661/">If you can give a few bucks, I’d be very grateful</a>! And, whether or not you give money to the fundraiser, please always feel free to send me any questions you have about Anglicanism, the Bible, Christian theology, Church history, etc.! I want to put my resources and training to good use!</p>
<p>In case you’re curious, here are some of the resources I’m most excited to own digitally in the Anglican Platinum library. I’d get 447 resources total, but here are the ones I’m most excited about:</p>
<ul>

<li>The Ancient Christian Doctrine Series</li>
<li>The Pillar New Testament Commentary Series</li>
