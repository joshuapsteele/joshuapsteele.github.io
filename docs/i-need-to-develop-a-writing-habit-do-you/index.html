<li>Edit a blog (<a href="http://anglicanpastor.com/rookieanglican/">Rookie Anglican</a>)</li>
<li>Write this personal blog</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>really</em> need to develop the habit of regular writing.</p>
<p>Up until now, I’ve largely relied upon writing in fits and starts, when the Muse descends, as it were.</p>
<p>This, however, is not good enough (as Stephen Pressfield forcefully says in his book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2DDHfu7"><em>The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles</em></a>). It won’t get my dissertation written, nor will it help me stay on top of two different blogs!</p>
<p>What’s the solution? A regular writing habit, day in and day out.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-developchange-a-habit">How to develop/change a habit</h1>
<p>There are plenty of guides out there on the internet about the process of habit formation. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">The Habits Guide: How to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones </a>[James Clear]</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them">Habits: How They Form and How to Break Them</a> [NPR]</li>
<li><a href="https://zenhabits.net/habitses/">The Four Habits that Form Habits</a> [Zen Habits]</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, there are two excellent books on habit formation that I highly recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2HHVT5Z"><em>The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business</em></a> by Charles Duhigg</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2pnd5Xz"><em>Better than Before: What I Learned About Making and Breaking Habits–to Sleep More, Quit Sugar, Procrastinate Less, and Generally Build a Happier Life</em></a> by Gretchen Rubin</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="habit--trigger--behavior--reward">Habit = Trigger + Behavior + Reward</h2>
<p>If you look through those resources, you’ll notice a particular model that appears again and again. A habit boils down to three things (this version of the framework mainly comes from Charles Duhigg’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2pkxfBO"><em>The Power of Habit</em></a><em>.</em> You can read the appendix of the book for free <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/">here</a>.) :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRIGGER</strong>: The cue or reminder that prompts the behavior. Frequently, cues involve
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>People (who are you with?)</li>
<li>Preceding Action (what did you just do?)</li>
<li>Emotion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BEHAVIOR</strong>: The behavior itself, whether something good for you, like writing 500 words every day, or something bad for you, like smoking a pack of cigarettes.</li>
<li><strong>REWARD</strong>: The benefit you get from the behavior.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Isolate the consistent TRIGGER. When you feel the craving to do the thing you’re trying to stop doing, ask yourself:
<ul>
<li>What time is it?</li>
<li>Where are you?</li>
<li>Who else is around?</li>
<li>What did you just do?</li>
<li>What emotion are you feeling?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Isolate the consistent REWARD. What benefit/craving is this habit providing/satisfying? Come up with an idea and test the theory by substituting different rewards until you find something that makes the craving goes away. This is what you’re really craving as a result of the behavior.</li>
<li>Insert a new BEHAVIOR between the trigger and the reward.
<ul>
<li>Choose a new activity that is triggered by the old trigger and provides the old reward.</li>
<li>Write this commitment down in the following form: “When [TRIGGER occurs], I will [do the new BEHAVIOR], because it provides me with [the REWARD].”</li>
<li>Follow through on your plan!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Come up with a TRIGGER:
<ul>
<li>Time?</li>
<li>Location?</li>
<li>People around?</li>
<li>Immediately preceding action?</li>
<li>Emotion?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Come up with a REWARD for after the behavior:
<ul>
<li>Make sure you actually enjoy it!</li>
<li>Make sure that you crave this reward when exposed to the trigger from the previous step!</li>
<li>Ideally, you will eventually desire the habit for its intrinsic reward. That’s what you’re shooting for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Insert the BEHAVIOR into a routine:
<ul>
<li>Write it down in the following form: “When [TRIGGER occurs], I will [perform desired BEHAVIOR], because it provides me with [the REWARD].”</li>
<li>Follow through on your plan!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-develop-a-writing-habit-my-example">How to develop a writing habit: my example</h1>
<p>In theory, it’s pretty simple, actually. We just need to take the previous outline, for how to develop a new habit, and apply it to the specific behavior of writing consistently. 500 words a day is a great goal, and it’s the one I’ll be using.</p>
<p>First, however, we need a TRIGGER. For me, the trigger I’m going to try out for the next few days is “When I arrive at the library in the morning, before doing anything else…”</p>
<p>The REWARD I’m going to experiment with is: “…I will go for a 20-minute walk outside.”</p>
<p>Put together, my commitment looks like: “When I arrive at the library in the morning, before doing anything else, I will write 500 words, because then I get to go for a 20-minute walk outside.”</p>
<h1 id="what-about-you-what-will-your-writing-habit-look-like">What about you? What will your writing habit look like?</h1>
<p>Would you like to create a writing habit?</p>
<p>If so, what’s your trigger going to be?</p>
<p>What’s your reward going to be?</p>
<p>What’s your writing behavior going to look like? How often will you write? How many words?</p>
