O Loving Father, we commend to your gracious keeping all who are near and dear to us.
Have mercy upon any who are sick, and comfort those who are in pain, anxiety, or sorrow.
Awaken all who are careless about eternal things.
Bless those who are young and in health, that they may give the days of their strength to you.
Comfort the aged and infirm, that your peace may rest upon them.">
