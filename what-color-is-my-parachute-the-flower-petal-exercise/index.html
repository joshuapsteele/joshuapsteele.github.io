Work through the book, especially the Flower Petal Exercise. It’s well-worth your time!\nThe Flower Petal Exercise The Flower Petal Exercise is a self-discovery tool designed to help individuals identify their career objectives and life goals. Using a visual analogy of a flower, it engages users in an interactive exploration of their skills, interests, values, and professional aspirations.\nThe ‘flower’ consists of seven ‘petals’ or components, each representing a different aspect of a person’s work-life:\nPeople Environments: Here, you define the type of people you enjoy working with. Consider factors such as company culture, team size, or the sociopolitical views of your colleagues. Working Conditions: This focuses on the conditions under which you perform best. It may include factors like flexible working hours, remote work, office settings, or your preference for a structured versus unstructured work environment. Transferable Skills: These are skills you’ve acquired over time that can be transferred across various roles and industries. For instance, project management, problem-solving, or leadership skills. Fields of Knowledge: This petal captures specific knowledge areas you’re interested in or have a deep understanding of. This could be anything from technology to psychology or even history. Level of Responsibility: This petal evaluates your desire for responsibility. Are you seeking a leadership role, or do you prefer a supportive, team member role? Salary and Level of Lifestyle: Here you outline your financial goals and the lifestyle you aim for. It includes considerations like desired salary, job benefits, and work-life balance. Values and Goals: This final petal is about your personal values and life goals, aligning your career with your moral compass and long-term aspirations. Each petal is equally important, and the final image should give you a holistic view of your career preferences and strengths. The objective of the Flower Petal Exercise is to help you understand yourself better, providing a clear vision of your career path and enabling you to make more informed decisions in your professional life.\nIt is important to remember that the exercise is not a one-time thing. Your ‘flower’ is expected to change and evolve as you grow, learn, and experience more in your life and career.\nOK, now on to my results!\nMy Preferred Kinds of People to Work With Reliable and dependable Honest, people of integrity Looking for and open to ways of improving Have a sense of humor Flexible, limited but purposeful supervision My “Holland Code”: I like to spend time and work with the following kinds of people:\nInvestigative Enterprising Conventional (My personal Holland combination is Investigative, Artistic, and Social.)\nMy Favorite Working Conditions Quiet (and cool…not too hot!)
